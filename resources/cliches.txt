a penny saved is a penny earned
a picture is worth a thousand words
actions speak louder than words
all that glitters is not gold
as we all know
at the end of the day
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
better late than never
better safe than sorry
blood is thicker than water
don't count your chickens before they hatch
don't judge a book by its cover
don't put all your eggs in one basket
easier said than done
every cloud has a silver lining
first and foremost
home is where the heart is
in this day and age
in today's society
it goes without saying
last but not least
money can't buy happiness
needless to say
only time will tell
practice makes perfect
rome wasn't built in a day
since the dawn of time
the early bird catches the worm
the grass is always greener
there's no place like home
throughout history
time will tell
when all is said and done
you can't judge a book by its cover
