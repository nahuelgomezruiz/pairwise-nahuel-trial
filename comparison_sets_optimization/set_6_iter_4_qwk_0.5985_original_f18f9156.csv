cf7611a,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it presents. The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author claims that the idea of inhabiting Venus is worthy due to its similarity to Earth. Paragraph 4 states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.

Although Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). As stated, the conditions would not be easy for humans, but survivable at the least. This supports the author's claim because this proves human life could be achieveable overall. This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach.

Some issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, ""The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus. The author's claim is supported in this statement because it is a simple solution to technology on Venus. There are very few rebuttals that overcome the postive effects of pursuing Venus.

With all the easy fixes, solutions and prep planned for Venus, the author's claim is overwhelmingly supported. The author proved Venus is certainly a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The positive outcomes outweigh the negatives in almost every aspect of this idea. There are multiple reasons presented in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" that prove attempting to explore Venus has a more successful outlook than not. Throughout the article, the facts and claims highly support the author's claim of Venus being a worthy planet to pursue.",5,2,0.8837180137634277
7fac76e,"Venus is a planet that is similiar, in certain ways, to earth. Earth and Venus both orbit the sun and Venus can be spotted from Earth. In this story, The author supports the idea of Venus exploration with great ideas and facts to support his claims. The authour says how visiting Venus could be both good and bad for humans and gives great reasoning on both point of views. The author never gives their opinion on the subject, but instead gives the reader reasons for both sides of the arguement.

In paragraph 3, the author says how Venus has a very dangerous atmosphere and supports that by saying that the clouds in the atmosphere are full of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. He says how the planets average temperature is over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The authour uses those facts to support the claim that those conditions are far more extreme than any human can withstand. In paragraph 4, he then goes on to say that long ago, Venus could have possibly been the closest thing to earth, being covered with oceans, valleys, and craters, possibly being able to support various life forms. He explains NASA? idea of a bimp like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the planets atmosphere for closer exploration, although the temperatures would still be very harsh.

The author ends off the writing by aying that humans must meet the challenges of Venus in order to conquer space exploration. Human curiosity could possibly come back araund and hurt us in the end, but we must know whats out there in case our planet is no longer inhabitable. He closes the story by saying that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited, but we should exceed them in order to be great.",3,2,0.8808636665344238
980a15b,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job at arguing their claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author used their thesis, counter-arguements, and rebutals to get across their point that Venus is a worthwhile investment to study. Some areas they exceeded and others they did not hit right on the ball.

The author throughout the essay did not convey a very well stated thesis. Typically, a writer of an arguementative essay would feature their thesis openly, so that the reader is able to see what side the author is pushing forward. However, this author did not do this. The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,"" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly.

Beyond the thesis, the author used many counter-arguements in their writing. This is one of their strong suits, acknowledging both sides of an arguement is one of the best ways to convey your opinion affectively, while still being able to keep opposing side of the arguement interested and have their minds open to change. The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same.

Furthermore, the author was able to affectively state rebutals and reinforce their own opinion with facts. From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray."" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,"" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues.

The author of ""The Callenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job when arguing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion.",6,2,0.6444295048713684
837b949,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus

Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Striving a challenge presented by Venus has value. Not only because of the insight to be gain on the planet itself. Also human curiosity likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venus sometime called the ""Evening Star,"" it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky and yet Venus can sometime be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

One of the reason the author support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is Venus is one of the planets close to the Earth. In the text ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus is more than three decades."" This quote from the text show that landing in the Planet on Venus is very diffcult and challenge planet for human to study, despite its proximity to us.

Another reason is Many researcher are having Venus as challengers because scientists go through mission to understand Venus would go up close despite the risks. Inthe text it stated ""Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working o innovation that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This mean that many scientist on the Earth will risk and take challenge to get and learn more about the venus and that it is worthy it to pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

My last reason why the author supports the idean that studying Venus is worthy persuit despite the dangers is that the National Aeronautics and space Administration NASA has compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Venus allow scientists to float above the fray.One of the example is ""...a vehicle over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by standing up and out of their way."" This shown that Venus are not bad as far as I know from the article because it allow scientist from the NASA working on studying on to Venus.

In conclusion Venus has a value. In the planet itself human are curiosity lead human into many equally intimidating endeavors. The article shown that many researcher includinding the scientist are making a mission both safe and scientifically productive. As we know the Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth level and it is not easy for survivable for human.",3,2,0.8403764963150024
fd553c7,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about the idea that venus is worth studying despite the dangers on the planet. venus is the seconed planet from the son making it close to earth. Acording to the author venus was often referred to as earth twins acording to the text it states ""Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size"". The author also states that venus has proved to be very challenging place to examine up close.

For many reason like ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxid"". Even more challenging reasons is clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere and temperatures over 800 degrees fahrengeit. Are just some of the reasons that it would be hard to explor venus. The author mainly just states the reasons its hard to vistit venus and the author really doesnt state why it would be worthy to go and study venus. Except for samples of rocks and gases.

Inconclusion it wouldnt be that worthy to visit venus its just to risky and a waste of time instead we could study other planets like mars. Which we already know alot about.",2,2,0.8963782787322998
e51434c,"The author suggests the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.To begin, the author has some ideas on how we should study Venus but doesn't say how going out and exploring it will affect humans.According to the article,""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet "" This means that the heat in Venus isn't very safe for humans or any object to stay in and the pressure is 90 times greater.Those who disagree might claim , there are more to explore in Venus and their coud be some kind of creature living in the planet even though it is very hot for someone to live that long in Venus.Despite these claims even though Venus has it's similarites to earth the high pressure and heat,Venusiaan geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking land on it's surface.Furthermore,the author gives some reasoning towards why studying Venus is a good idea, he/she says that if we can find a way to live in venus then we should since Venus is the most Earth-like planet and we should have no problem living there since their so alike.

In Conclusion,The author's suggestion has some good evidence supporting his idea but putting those who will go out to visit Venus

are risking there life due to it's high temperture and pressure knowing they won't find anything and it being to dangerous to have the human society living there and not taking the problems that Venus has and to know that Venus isn't similar to Earth at all.",2,2,0.8943744897842407
