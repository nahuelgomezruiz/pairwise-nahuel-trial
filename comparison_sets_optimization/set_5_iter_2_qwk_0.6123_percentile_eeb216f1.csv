8d82dec,"In the article "" The Challenging of Explore Venus"" it is about the author suggesting the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is the brightest point of light in the night sky which is a challenging place to examine more closely, it explains how they sent numerous spacecraft which none survived the landing for more than a few hours "" Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" (para 2)the author is explaining how its been so long that no one has touched down on Venus or survived the landing which makes it a challenging planet for humans to study. It has a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide which blankets Venus "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrisive sulfruroc acid in the atmosphere. On planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmpospheric pressure 90 times greater"" (Para 3) this means Venus has the hottest surface temperature from any planet in the solar system it has weather like Erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and lightning strikes to probes going on the land on its surface. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to knowledge Venus, "" Nasa is working on other approaches to studying Venus"" this means Nasa is finding better ways to make their technology last longer and be resistant to Venus and its weather condtions. Therefore, the author has good explanation why its challenging the idea to study Venus with its worthy pursuit of dangers. ",3,2,0.8859727382659912

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is very for the exploration of Venus. Venus is a planet in our solar system. It is sometimes called the evening star because it is one of the brightest points in the night sky or it is called Earth's twin due to similarity in density and size. We also dont know much about Venus because it is very dangerous due to very hot temperatures and many other things. But exploring it would be very worth it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents beacause human curiosity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors, we could get more insight about Venus, and our travels on Earth, and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts.

One reason that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is beacuse human curiousity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Who knows, human curiousity and advancing in technology could lead us to any other planet in our solar system. The more we know about life the more we can explore. In the story it says, "" These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" If we explore Venus we can most definitely explore Mars as well.

Another reason that studying Venus is worthy is beacuse we can get more insight about Venus. We need more information about Venus because it is Earth's sister planet. The more we understand Venus the easier it will be to understand space. In the text it says, "" If our sister planet is so inhospititable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface"" This could possibly mean we could live on Venus someday. That would be a major benefit if anything ever happened to Earth.

The third reson that studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers is because our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubt. If we don't explore there is no explanations to peoples questions. Everyday we risk our lives because we never know what can happen. We shouldn't limit our decisions and our exploration based on fear. In the text it says "" just as ariplanes travel at a high altitude"" which means that it wouldnt be anything super unsafe to hover above Venus so why not try and do it.

In conclusion, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

If we explored it human curiousity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors, we could learn more about venus, and our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by our dangers and doubts. Venus is a planet that is very close and similar to Earth why should we not explore it?

So much good would come out of the exploration of Venus. The danger of anything shouldn't stop people from exploring.                    ",4,2,0.8329046964645386
27e155e,"In the Article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" there are a lot of good reasons to explore Venus it is known as Earth's ""twin"". Venus in particular it stands out in the article it said ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds"" venus is the closest planet to earth yet they both travel and both have different speeds. Furthermore venus has never actually be seem up close or touched before as in human contact ""A single spaceship has not touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". Venus has a lot higher pressure and conditions then earth "" clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"" and ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" it has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. But it is going to be a challenge to do studies on Venus but NASA is considering

to send a human to study Venus or Researchers are working on innovating a machine that would last long enough to study Venus. They find it facinating

because Venus has quite a few similarities to Earth "" Venus still has some fetures that are analogous to those on earth"" as in ""Planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar fetures such as valleys, mountains, and craters"". Furthermore the article applys many reasons why we should put time into studying and observing Venus.",1,2,0.8571968078613281

Studying venus is a wortthy pursit despit its dangers, venus has simlair features to earht in fact the text it referred to as Earth ""Twin"" becaus e of its size and density and sometimes the distance from the sun. venus long ago,""probably"" had oceans and spme type of forms of life living on venus, at this moment in time if you look at a picture are captured of venus you would see rocky sediment and features such as valleys,mountains and craters.

Now that we've understand the good aspects of venus their are some very dangerous cons about veunes. at thirty plus miles above surface the temperature rises at 170 degrees farenheit it sounds nice and toasty but air pressure would close to sea level on earth,solar power would be plentifull and radiation would not exceed on earth so its not survuable for humans. many spaceships landed on venus but many didnt make it back due to conditions of the tempature in closing as much as we want to disciver new things and find somewhere other then earth we must look at the terms and conditions ",2,2,0.8471451997756958
960e817,"Studying Venus, while that sounds unsafe and a waste of time it's not. Venus has many things similar to Earth, and is speculated to once harbor life just like earth. ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" is an example of this.

Landing on Venus with humans is impossible, because of the amount of gasses and solar radiation along with the extremely hot tempatures. However, NASA is working on an idea to let astronauts survey the planet up close without actually landing on it. NASA has the idea to make a blimp like spacecraft that would fly thirty miles above Venuses ground leaving humans in an area that is barely survivable. ""Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system."" and "" The National Aeronautics and Space Administraition (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" are both claims from the article.

In conclusion The authors support of the idea studying Venus, while dangerous is worthwile. there are many dangers, but there are also areas for surviveable conditions. Although there is no way for humans to set foot on venus that doesn't mean there is not a way for people to get as close as possible.   ",3,2,0.835591733455658
