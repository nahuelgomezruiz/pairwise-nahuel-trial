6d19518,"The evening star, the closest to us, the one with famliar features, our nearest option for a planetary visit, what are the options for making a mission safe and scientifically productive?

Venus also known as the evening start, is actually a planet and it is

simple to see from the distant, it has proved a very challenging place where it can be examinaded closely by, Austronomers are insteresded by Venus because it has been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and has famliar things such as mountains, valleys and cratear. There have been made many studies to work with Venus, NASA is woking in another approches to studying venus, for example some especific old eletronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such coinditions, NASA has also a particulary compelling idea for sending human to study Venus. NASAs posible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Striving to meet this venus challenge our travels and beyond should not be limited by dangers and boubts but should be expanded to meet every edge of imaginantion and innovations.

in conculsion the challenge of exploring venus article show us that Venus is not a bad planet to study and there are many posibilities for humans to go there it has not easy conditions but survivable for humans, studies have been alredy made and Venus is an earth-like planet what makes the studies more clear.

4433232,"This is an essay about Venus. In this essay I am going to tell you about the Venus an is it worth pursuit despite all the dangers. Venus is to me is yes it is worth pursuiting despite all of its dangers to the human life form. I belive this cause how are we ever going to know the truth if we don't go and find it out for ourselfs. We have to go out there an look for ourself so that we know what is out there. What really extist was there once life form on Venus. If so whendid they die or are they still there. See we will never uncover the truth if we dont break out of our shell and go exporing to the unknown we have to do it. Nobody esle is going to go out into space and find out what is really up in space.

We have our theory about other life out in space, of the once vallys, mountains and the carter on the surface of Venus so that we have our theory that once a long long time ago there once were a form of life on Venus. Now we have to think about how they lived, how they got their food, how they did all the thing sthat we as humans do but on a planet that has low gravit pulling you down. On Earth we have a greater about of gravit pull us down to the ground than Venus does. Earth has also more water than Venus does now, but what if that was to change . What if the planet Venus had more water than Earth. What if Venus and better things than Earth does. Then why did Venus died what had to happen to whipe out and whgole plant that had maybe life form of some sort and that we know had water and enough oxygen to have the livingh life form of some kind to kive there. So what did happen to the planet Venus. How did this onbce living planet now become with no life form of any kinds.

The only danger of this idea of going to the planet Venus is that what if they don't make it home. Whatif ther are other life form living on Venus still but we just dont know what they are or how they came about there are hunders of thing that we as human we have not yet discover. An maybe will never discover about how we got to where we are today. How we have got what we have today. These are thing that we may never truthy understand about where we came from. How we got to this day in time and how are we going to live these thing are unknown, till the end of time.  ",2,2,0.7324835062026978

Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of ""The Challenge Exploring Venus,"" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to ""intimidating endeavors."" The author claims that the studying of Venus is still an active pursuit despite the dangers that come along with it. The claim is supported well by using previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics that catch the readers attention.

The author tells the story of previous missions that have been sent to Venus in hopes to persuade the audience that the planet's harsh conditions are too intense for even high technology to withstand. He mentions, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is.

The use of statistics is presented by the author to take a more logical view on their argument to prove the dangers of Venus. The article mentions that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus."" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue.

Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.

252141e,"The planet venus is close to the sun which makes it impossible for humans too be on there, on paragraph 3 it states ""on the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. these cnditions are far more exreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" so the temperature is horrible and is not habitable for humans to raom there even in space suits, but scientists discovered or theorize that the planet Venus has similair features like planet Earth and they said it once had water on it on paragraph 4 it states,""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" there is likely that is could be like Earth but the planet is too close too the sun, Nasa is approaching other options too discover more of the surface of that planet as it refers on paragraph 7 it says,""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" their confidence and surennes about this project is so challenging for them but its not impossible for them because they said on paragraph 8,""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has Value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" and there not scared to exapnd their limits, one day they'll achieve that dream.",2,2,0.8437297940254211
1cbab90,"The author's claim in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is not well supported by the evidence provided, and the reasoning behind the evidence. The author claims that the planet Venus would be a worthy goal to pursue, despite the dangerous conditions and harmful atmosphere that the planet posseses. The author provides information on possible ways that we could overcome the challenge of landing on the planet Venus, but no clear reason as to why we should pursue this goal besides his own rationalization of a reason provided at the end of the article. Not only is the evidence that the author provides theoretical in the efficiency of the tools stated on another planet, but the purpose of the tools in collecting samples and taking photos is not descibed or elaborated on. Despite the risks, the author has no clear reason for the benefit of landing on Venus, and the tools that the author proposes do not support the idea that it would be possible to land on Venus and actively collect samples or take pictures.

The author claims that the value of returning to Venus ""seems indisputible"" in paragraph 4, but the only reason for this claim is his analogy that Venus is similar in structure to Earth. In paragraph 5, the author states that a possible way to approach the planet seems possible, because NASA had an idea to create ""a blimp-like vehicle to hover over Venus."" The author in paragraph 6 states that the blimp would only allow us to recieve ""limited insight"" on the planet, and we would not be able to take samples or take pictures due to the dense atmosphere. The author does not provide any possible way to collect samples and overcome this issue, besides stating how ""many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This statment provides no actual evidence as to any progress researchers have made, or if anything useful will come from the knowledge of the surafce Venus.

In paragraph 7, the author mentions a technology made of ""silicon carbide"" that has been tested by NASA, and survived a simulation of the conditions of Venus for three weeks. The author does not elaborate on the uses for these strong electronics, and leaves the reader guessing at the purpose of this technology. The author also mentions the use of mechanical computers used in the 1940s during World War II. The author speaks of how these computers make calculations by using gears and levers, but does not elaborate on anything else besides their increased resistance to ""pressure, heat, and other forces."" Once again the author provides no clear reason to the purpose behind the inventions, besides the possible survival of the technology on Venus.

Finally, the author presents his own opinion in paragraph 8. The author states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planent itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Paragraph 8, as the author has wrote, is entirely opinionated and dangerously optimistic. His reasoning behind the value of ""meeting the challenge of Venus"" is the equivalent to practice for humanity, because ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally indimidating endeavors."" The authors opinion of the research on Venus, as shown by this statment, seems to be entirely based on the idea that we should practice for future endeavors despite the dangers which is not only naiive, but dangerous.

To summarize all of this information, the author shows no clear reason as to why we should risk the resources and manpower to attempt an expedition on Venus. The author provides no purpose for the tools stated besides their increased survivability rate, and the author's opinion is forced onto the reader by stating in paragraph 8 that we should ignore the dangers and doubts of exploration to meet the limits of innovation. The author poorly supports his claim of ""a worthy pursuit despite the dangers"" and provides no facts or evidence for the benefits of humanity attempting the challenge of Venus.

d71b7f8,"On earth people have gotten so comfortable in their skin but imagine being able to explore a different planet and see the similarites and differences. We would be able to understand a differnt planet and how it corilates to earth. Studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is a worthy persuit because people can study Venus from the closes view and still surivive, trying to sciencefically figure out what Venus has on their planet and how it is like the earth, and lastly that machines to discover what is really happening on Venus despite the conditions.

Studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because people can discover what is happening on Venus and discover something new. The text states, "" 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans""(Paragraph 5). The author is stating that there is a way that they can still discover what is really on the planet witout being on the planet to find out. Another reason it is a worthy persuite is because they want to study the planet to find out the similarites and differences. "" The most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth""(Paragraph 4). This quote shows that they want to discover what is going on in Venus because they want to find out if it is really similiar or differnt to Earth. Lastly scientist are trying to make a machine that can withstand the the conditions on the planet Venus. The text states, "" Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces""(Paragraph 7). The author shows that these machines are going to be able to withstand the weather and the atomoshpere with the right materials. Without the right materials it is not going to be able to stand on Venus and get information.

Learning about Venus and how it works is worth it depise the dangers it can bring on to it. People can survive seeing Venus by not being so close to the planet, study Venus to figure out the similarties and differences between the Earth, and lastly using machines that have proper material to study Venus in that condition. Venus could bring a lot of history towards us and figure out if its similar to the Earth like they are saying to end the investigation.         ",3,2,0.8065159320831299
