f8e6cf7,"The author supports the idea by telling us how Venus has great temperature. In the text it says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.' This means this eas the first time they've had great weather on 800 degrees. Venus is the closest place to visit. In the text it says "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains , and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.' Which mean Venus can possibly do space travel back in time. At tthirty-plus miles above surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degreea fahrenheit , but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentful , and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy condtions , but survivable for humans.So its saying it only safe for hmans but other condtions.'However , peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditond because most forms of photography and videography ineffective. This means it only provived those things. In conclusion Venus was a great place to live and sttay at.",1,2,0.8066045045852661
0e9b816,"Should NASA Go to Venus?

Our Solar System, Earth, Space. Many astronomers want to get more information on our Solar System and the planets on it. For example, Venus. NASA should not make ann exploration to study on Venus because of the risks and the affects it could have on humans.

In the article,""The Challenge of exploring Venus"", it states the interest NASA has on Earth's ""twin"" Venus. However many of the condtions on Venus are very different from our home, Earth: Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our sola system,"" (Paragraph 3). With hot conditons many risks can arise.

Well, What about Humans? As in the last Paragraph Venus' condtions are not very safe. NASA knows the risks that could play out, but they believe it can work: ''NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scienetists to float about the fray,""(Paragraph 5). With the right technology, the risk of Venus's hot and rocky could be elminated, with a few ""minor"" problems.

With NASA's possible ""sollution"" to explore Venus, it would eliminate some problems but the overall condtions would make it hard for humans. This is seen in Paragraph 3,""Tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"". Even with NASA's sollution,the heat and the enviorment would not prevent that much harm with this sollution.

Some people might say that even with the condtions being risky, it is still survivable: ""Not easy condtions, but survivable,""(Paragraph 5). However Venus's weather and condtions can be very unpredictable. It would put peoples lives in danger not knowing what to predict. If NASA does have a sollution will it be able to be ready for unpredictable weather and conditions:"" additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface,""(Paragraph 3).

However some people might add that there are conditions on Venus that humans could survive, like solar power and less radation,(Paragraph 5). These things would be somewhat ""okay"" condtions for humans, with NASA's sollution in place.

But overall a trip to Venus would cause many risks and problems due to the conditions and affects they would have on humans. Therefore, sciencetists should not study Venus with the dangers present.            ",4,2,0.8397277593612671
fe37a5a,"Venus is called “Evening Star,”. Venus is the closest planet to Earth.Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is sometimes right around the corner,in space terms,humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

Atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet. Venus cover Large Ocean and suppor virous forms of life, just like Earth. (NASA) has one particularly idear for sending humans to study Venus. Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.

Temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground. rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

Venus’s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venus is really danger.spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.",3,2,0.7910709381103516
bae2934,"Have you ever wanted to know about the planet Venus? Some of you wouldnt want to study or pay attention to the planets in space. Some of you would like to pay attention to the streets or what not. It does not matter if you dont like space or planets but if you thinking about it, then now is the time to learn about the planet Venus. In the excerpt, the author explains that Venus is sometimes called the ¨Evening Star.¨ This something that you will be shocked about because I wouldve never known. He also explains that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He explains the idea very well because want to welcome many people to study the world to see whats its like to know when something is gonna happen or how its gonna happen.

Sometimes studying things can be real helpful because you can learn so many things about it. The article states, ¨These differences in the speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times we are closer to

Venus.¨ This indicate that anything could happen if we touch one of those planets. He addresses the speed in the planets when it orbits the sun. Anything can go wrong if its always going like that. Its like having something spinning around everyday. Eventually, something is gonna go wrong and its gonna mess everything up. On the other hand, People who study space would know the answer to what will happen if they was to touch. The author basically wants others to care about the world. He wants others to see both parts of the world. It doesnt matter if something is bad you should still have respect and love in it because its here for a reason. He stated ¨ Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. This means that if we are traveling and something goes wrong we shouldnt have to stop traveling because of the dangers. We should be able to still travel to avoid giving people so much worries. Traveling should be expanded to reach like different destinations so people can see whats its like to care for the world and whats its like to not csre care for the world.

In conclusion, studying the world can be a big part of helping the world understand the parts of whats going on around. What the aurthor does is he explains his thoughts on Venus and give real facts after to show that he understands some parts of Venus. Despite the fact that he is caring about the dangers that can be caused around us; he wants to take a look at both sides. Thats how he supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despte the dangers so well.                                          ",2,2,0.7517949342727661
76b6a48,"Humans are challenging to study about Venus. Venus is an planet which is very close to the Earth. Sometimes, Venus is the closest to the Earth and other time to Mars that is caused by the right around the corner. Before, we have tried to send numerous spacecraft but didn't survive the landing for more than a few hours. Therefore, any single spaceship has never touched on Venus in more than three decades. However, why do we still challenge to the the planet Venus and why is it a challenge?

As a first reason, Venus has similar points to the earth. There is a possibility that long time ago, oceans had been covering the surface of Venus, and had life like the Earth. On Venus, there are also mountains, valleys, crater as like the earth. What more, Venus is an option of a planetary visit. Air pressure at about thirty miles from Venus would be close to that of sea level on earth which contains that not perfecrt condition, but survivable for humans.

For a second reason, It is not easy to reach to the Venus. There are not only alike things to each other for Earth and Venus. For example, the temperatures are totally different. Temperatures on the Venus's surface, it is over 800 for average. As the article says, ""The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Par. 3), there is a huge difference between the atmospheric pressure of Earths's and Venus's. At Venus, you will be having high solar power which is plentiful, and radiation is not similar to the Earth.

As third reason, we haven't even take the samples of the Venus. Researchers haven't collect any samples of rock, gas, or anything else from Venus That could be our challenge. If we could take their samples from there, the research would be easier and helpful. In fact, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus""(Par.7). They are using an old technology which is very powerful, flexible, and quick. NASA thinks that those computers will be useful for studying Venus.

As a conclusion, there are some advantages that human challenge for the other planets. As we are studying other planets, Venus is a good planet for a future of us caused by many reasons. Yet, we are still on our way to know about the Venus, human need to keep looking for the importance of challenge to the Venus.",3,2,0.8206671476364136
