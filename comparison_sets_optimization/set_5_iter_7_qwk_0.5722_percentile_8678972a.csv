This star is called a venus is one of the brightest points of light in the light sky. In htis essay i will talkin about the challenging of exploring venus , by the end the understanding and the point of view will be changed.

In this first paragraph I will further give extended details and further elaborate on what venus is. Venus is the second p[lanet from our sun . Venus is easy to see at nighy only because how bright it is and how it stands out. but you will hardly ever get to see it closely you will more than likely see it better from a distance and that's what makes it so difficult and challenging and what makes the oppurtunity for me to be able to further explain why it is challenging . Venus is also the closets planet to earth in size and density. According to the article it says ""often referred to as earths twin venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size"". This further and explains more on venus giving a better and more constructerd uderstanding of venus.            ",1,2,0.7353898286819458
bebb184,"Venus our sister planet, with her surface being the harshes of the other planets and her breathtaking carbon dioxide atmosphere that takes up 97%. Venus been looked at for years as the next planet to visit,as so is Mars but lets talk to her yet,Venus has been studied to know that their had been life on her before and what causes the carbon dioxide and what forces the planet to keep its posure. Venus is a really complicated planet and the thought of visiting could be harmful.

As in the 1800s devices where invisioned but not in that way,since World War 2 computers were first looked at in 1940s and the technology they had back them was even close to compare to modern day,as they were slow to load and ares was fast to load .

But think even with modern day technology,we do still fail to communicate so what if we try to vist Venus and then the connection with the commanding officer is lost and now your space floating and that their is a real danger.

So maybe going to venus is not bad idea but its an idea that won't happen but who knows, lets not see whose survives the longest.

But my conclution is why does Venus have to be the go to planet, despite all the carbon dioxide and her 800 degrees Fahrenheit. I know why we picked Venus becaouse it's the exact size of us and the 2nd closes to the sun.",2,2,0.7862976789474487
50ce20c,"Although, Venus is seen as unlivable and dangerous to human life, NASA has thought of an idea to defeat the odds. Venus is our neighboring planet, and once long ago, may have been the most Earth-like. To this day, there are still some anologous features. Will this be enough to convince the Nation that we should send NASA astronuats to Venus?

Venus is protected by a thick atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide. The clouds on Venus are highly corrosive. Temperatures average 800 degrees F, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times more than what we experience here on Earth. If our neighboring planet is so inhospitable, why do scientists want to visit it?

NASA has a possible solution to all of these conditions that a human cannt withstand. The article states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" NASA's plan is to have a spacecraft floating above Venus' toxic atmosphere. Temperatures would still be toasty, at around 170 degree Fahrenheit. But the air pressure would be close to Earths at sea level. There would be enough solar power, and the radiation levels would not exceed Earth's. These are not easy living conditions, but they are just enough for survival. This brilliant idea does come with soem downfalls. The astronauts would not be able to collect samples of rock, gas, or anything from this distance. Standard forms of photography or videography would render useless.

I think NASA should not send researches to Venus without having enough background information. They should continue conducting research. If researchers would to Venus, they would have to risk their health and maybe even lives, to collect some samples. I think NASA should work on different mechanical and technological approaches.

Exploring Venus could give NASA insight information of its past, present and future features. Although NASA has come up with a seemingly brilliant plan, there is some downsides to it. Overall, safety becomes the first priority, there is still some work that needs to be done.            ",3,2,0.7993844151496887
3d0cbc9,"Is Venus worth studying? Venus being Earth's alike twin is one of the most hottest plant on our solar system, yet not one you can visit for more than a few hours. Scientist have thought about sending machines to study and deeply reasearch more about the planet Venus, but Venus being too hot they overthink it about the temperature and how hot it is. Venus is a very hot planet that can melt anything that's metal and a human-being could not even survive on this planet.

Venus is known as Earth's ""twin"". People believe that venus was once just like earth, that it was covered with oceans before it got extremely hot and became like hell because of it's temperature. the the article, In paragraph 4, ""Surface of rocky sediment, familiar features such as valley's mountains, and craters."" There was or still are some land features on Venus, but as we continued to read the article it told us that if there were any land seeking on it's planet that it would be stroke by lightning. ""Temperatures average over 800 degrees fahreneit, atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet."" Venus being one of the most hottest planet on the soaler system and presenting impediments such as volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightening strikes. Overall, Venus is known as earth's alike ""Twin"". It is one of the hottest planets on the solar system, no human being could survie on it by it's high temperatures. Land can't be seeking or else it gets destroyed by lightning. Scientist do believe that it was once like earth, and had oceans.

Venus being too hot and such a risky planet to explore. Researchers have been overthinking and trying to invent technology that's able to resist Venus's temperature. ""Researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" NASA has thought about sending people to explore Venus on a jet airplane, that's able to stay high above ground suface. Reasearchers do know that if they risk and send people out to explore, it is going to be callenging to get samples of rocks, gas, or anything else from a distance.""Electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface, having lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Venus with such high temperatures and metal not lasting long that can melt very quickly, they've been testing, trying to get machines made out of different material so it can last on Venus. In other words, Venus is too hot and exposing a phone, tablet, or any electronic to acid or heat can be melted tin and no machine is resistant to such an exaggerated heat. NASA have thought and been wanting to send people to explore Venus but the thought of it being too risky, dangerous is what they wonder.

In conclusion, Is Venus worth studying? No, It is a very hot planet, that's risky, challenging, and dangerous for humans to explore. Not even a machine can last on land. Reasearchers have tried and invented machines to try and get somewhere, it's hard for them to even get a smaple from a distance. Venus is a very hot planet that can melt anything and huam-beings couldn't even survive on this planet.           ",4,2,0.7893592119216919
234a75d,"In this article the author explains what Venus is at first , next he/she explains the benefit of learning about it and then finally talks about the dangers and challenges that come with studying it. Venus or the ""Evening Star"" is a planet similar to earth in size and density and is even reffered as earths ""Twin"". Yet these to are two very different planets, for example Venus's atmosphere suffers from the ""greenhouse effect"" which causes its surface temperature to average around 800 degrees fahrenheit! It also supports no life at least that we know of to this point unlike Earth.

To study the ""twin"" of Earth we must first either put something on the surface of the planet or take pictures of the planet from right outside the planet. This is a problem because its so hot on the surface that it will melt our currant technology and with the greenhouse effect the atmosphee is to thick to take pictures through. This is obviously a problem for scientist who want to learn more about the planet Venus. If we do learn about Venus though it might benefit us tremendously because we will know how to prevent Earth from having the same problem Venus did that eventually destroyed the planet into what it is today.

In conclusion I think the Author of this article realizes the dangers of studying eath's ""twin"" Venus but ultimantly thinks that the positives outweigh the negitives on this one and I agree. If Venus at one point really was like earth and supported life we need to know what destroyed it to prevent us from rewriting history. I think that outweighs any danger or problem in the longrun and Im sure the author would agree with me based on his/her article. Scientist as I type this are working on a solution for problems such as the ones up above and I wouldnt be surprised if we learned a lot more anout Venus in these next couple of decades!",3,2,0.8013261556625366
