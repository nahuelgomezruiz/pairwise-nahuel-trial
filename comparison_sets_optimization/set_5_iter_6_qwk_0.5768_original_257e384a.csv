775ee7f,"The author supports this idea very well, becuase he has dine lots of research. Trying to visit planet Venus can be very dangerous becuase of what it has on and around the planet. ""Humans have sent many spaceships to Venus but no spacecraft had survived the land for more than a few hours"", said the author. The only reason that we can not stay on the planet is because, one there is a thick atmosphere of alomst 97 percent carbon dioxid. Two becuase in order to get on to the planet you would have to go through clouds and clouds on Venus are not like clouds on Earth. But on Venus they are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Three on the planets surface the tempertures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Four the atmostpheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we have on Earth. And these conditions are far more extreme than ANYTHING on Earth. With that kind of atmostpheric pressure it woukd crush a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest part of the ocean, and it would liquefy many metals. Venus has the hottest surface than any planet in the Solar System, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Venus is just like Earth, there are some features on Venus that Earth has. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment, and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters. NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. But with the technolgy that Earth has today i think that we could send something to Venus to do research. To see if were to be able to send someone there and take samples. But striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has vlaue, not only because of insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us to many eauality intimidating endeavors.

3122de5,"The author supports that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers represents. Venus is a planet closest to Earth. It's conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth. Venus may be the most Earth-like plannet in our solar system. Venus has more characteristics than Earth does.

Veus conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in our solar system. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. It is crazy imaging Venus having way more pressure than Earth. The text sasy, ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupying volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes."" This shows that Venus has many powerful climate changes. The author states this becaue, he wants to inform us how dangers Venus can be, but yet so interesting and gives readers want to know more of it.

According to the article, Venus may be the most Earth- like plannet in our solar system. The text says, ""Often referred to as Earth's twin."" Venus is closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. This shows that people may know Venus as a different version as Earth. This relates that the author supports the idea of studying Venus is worthy because it is very similar to Earth, so why not study it and explore it? The author may think that Venus can be somewhere people can survive in and look more forward to.

Venus has way more characteristics than Earth does. The author stated how it is the hottest surface temperature, more powerful climate cahnges, more atmospheric pressure, etc. Venus is a unique planet. The author want us to invest more to Venus, because it has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.

Venus has dangers it despites, but can be so interesting to invest more on. The author thinks Venus may be the most earth-like plannet in our system. It is like Earth's 'twin'. So, if it's similar to Earth, why not look more forward to studying Venus. It is important to know what's surrounded in Earth.   ",3,2,0.8502823710441589
4148241,"Venus is a planet that catches the attention from stargazers to people who work for NASA. Venus can also be seen eassily by amateur stargazers because of it's brightest points from the light in the night sky. Venus can be called Earth twin becasue we have the same density and size in terms.

National Aeronatics and Space Administrations has sent people in space ships to Venus for studies of the planet. Also studying if Venus if it had harsh conditions like, temprature level, radiation level, life forms, and Etc. If hovering or orbiting Venus above safely you can see visable ground and some conditions. Space ships can't fully land on Venus because of density.

Old technology has been big impact on society, inventors, and innovators. mechanical computers help during World War 2 doing caculations by using gears. Now computers can be used for games, research, and personal uses. The same thing when the first moving transportation came it inspired people to innovate more ideas like buses, different cars, planes/jets, space ships, Ect. As you can when the future gets better maybe we can fully discover about Venus. ",1,2,0.7846828699111938
7bc0860,"The author supports his theory of going to venus is a worthy pursuit by having creative ideas and sources that supply him with evidence to back up his claim.

Venus has earth like features, its extremely hot and its 97% carbon dioxide.

In the article the author claims that venus has earth-like features ""Astronomers are fascinathed by venus because it my well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" this statment gives details on how venus my have looked like earth a long time ago.

In the article the author claims that venus is very hot ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on earth;such an environment would crash even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" in this statment the author gives many specific details on how venus has the hottest surface tempature than any other planet in our solar system.

In the article the author claims that venus is 97% carbon dioxide "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of higly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere.""in this statment the author explains venus's atmosphere.

in conclusion the author did a very good job explaining and education on how venus is a good planet to study despite the many dangers it has.         ",3,2,0.8445426225662231
a2cce9b,"The author of this story uses a lot of information about exploring Venus. He writes about the history of Venus and the dangers of travling there too. But, is it really worth sending people to Venus if they are just going to die ?

The author talks about the dangers of going to Venus very well. He inculdes that the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. He also says the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. That type of environment would crush a submarine, which are meant to dive into the deepest parts of earth's oceans. The one thing the author does well is he covers all of the dangers of going to Venus. Even thought he is trying to convince the reader that it's a good idea to explore Venus.

The one thing the author does not write about is how much all of this is going to cost and who is going to pay for it. The one thing people care about is money and if the author is trying to convince someone to make this happen they are most likely going to want to know how much this would cost. If people who pay their taxes are going to end up paying for this I don't think people would be to happy. Most likely a trip to Venus would cost more than when NASA went to the moon. Other than the author not talking about the cost, he covers everything else pretty well.

The author also talks about how NASA is trying to figure out new projects and using old porjects to get to Venus. He says that scientists are making simplified electronics made of silicon carbide to be tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in these conditions. I think the reason the author gives you this information is because he wants you to think that there are other people who want to explore Venus as well. Another project the author talks about is scientists looking back at old technology called mechanical computers. He says that these mechanical computers would be better than the new computers because the new ones are very frail and can't be under rough conditions. But the old computers are not frail and can be put into rough conditons, such as Venus's rough conditions.

The author supports his idea about going to Venus very well. His idea would be better though if he added some information about how much it would cost to go to Venus. He did have a lot of infromation on the new projects that NASA was developing and how dangerous it was to travel to Venus as well. Other than not having the costs this was a pretty intresting article and well developed. ",4,2,0.7282415628433228
