Venus is called the Evening star is the only one of the brightes point . venus is actually a planet . in the solar planet.

They two has a different speed mean that sometimes we are closet to mArs and others times to venus.

The thick of the admosphere is a big percent of the carbon dioxide,the temperature is so big like is so up because is in the around of the planet solar.

The scientist are try to find the weatherhow going to be on all the days is something similary with the solar planet they are triing to find some thinks .

and the wen they find we going to know what is going to happen.

Studying Venus would present some danger and conflict in the course of its event. This is because not only is the temperature over 100x more dramatic than a regular September day for a hoosier, but it also contains sulfuric acid all throughout the planet and the surface. The author states, ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals"". This is not the kind of environment that the Property Brothers are just dying to build some houses in... Although, it has it's many perks.

Studying Venus is a 'worthy pursuit', says author, but why? With every pro event comes its cons and vice versa. Though an extremely dangerous environment to step foot on, there is more to it than the ability to melt a submarine. The education behind Venus is the most attractive part being that Venus once was the most Earth-like planet and could potentially have held Earth like creatures in the depths of it all. Not only is it an educational expirience for just you, but visiting Venus would give so much to scientists and austonomers to work with for upcoming life events.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Now that you have read this, think back to the beggining statement, what would it take for YOU to explore Venus? The Author of 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus' would and he is smart for saying so. The author uses evidence and claim to support his idea thoroughly.",3,2,0.8111071586608887
efd7312,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author gives reasons why we should care of exploring venus, what we can get out of it, and how all of this will become helpfull at the end of the day. The author gives good detail about how we are able to do such things and does a great job on showing the progress we, as humans, have made. He also mentions how their is so much to learn about this planet that we can all benefit from for knowing; this is a big motive to why there are still visits to this strange planet.

The author goes in depth, about how Venus is a very interesting planet, how it is very much close and related to Earth, and why it is relevant to anyone. With a big question being; Can this somehow be helpful to the knowledge of humans?, The author begins to show how fascinating of a planet it is and goes into further detail on what this planet is and what its like. Unfortunately it is no suitable for human survival (as mentioned from the author), but the author says it was once a planet that could hold several different life forms; it could be rough for humans, but we would be able to survive. The author then gives great detail on how we can find out more about this strange planet, and also gives us more information on what we can do; like how people are currently making machines that will be able to walk on the surface of Venus, despite its rough turrain and living conditions. They also mention many reasons why we should care, continue to visit Venus, and give interesing facts about Venus; while doing an amazing job on pursuading the viewer simultaniously.

The article can represent what we can do as a species and how far we have come. With having such intelligence, we are very and easily fascinated by something such as Venus. The author does a great job on summarizing how interesting this planet is to us and how each reader should also be caring about something so astonishing.            ",3,2,0.8130336999893188
9b873c2,"In the article, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. The author explains why throughout the article, and tries to persuade readers into thinking that Venus is a planet we should not give up on. But the question still remains, why are scientist still researching this planet if it's so dangerous?

In paragraph one, the author explains that Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. This may bring an interest to astronomers and stargazers that enjoy studying and watching the sky at night. This may be a worthy cause for some people to continue studying Venus. In paragraph two, the author explains how Venus is sometimes referred to as ""Earth's twin"". Venus is almost the same size and density of Earth and it also close in distance. Some people may find this interesting because people on Earth are always looking for other forms of life and other places to go besides Earth. If Venus is like Earth, in physical and other ways, there may be life on Venus that we haven't discovered yet.

One of the most important things to know is that Venus once could have been the most Earth-like planet in the entire solar system. I believe that this information is very important and more people should keep studying that. In paragraph four it says that Venus ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" If it held life back then, why wouldn't it now? If Venus was once like Earth why couldn't Earth be like Venus now? Some people may worry that Earth will turn out like Venus, with high temperatures and crazy atmospheric pressures. If scientists and astronomers find more information about this planet, we could have almost every answer we need for all our questions.

Traveling to Venus is a very difficult and dangerous process. In the article the author states that NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an idea for sending people from Earth to study the planet, Venus. They are trying to create a vehicle that hovers the planet instead of going directly on the surface of Venus. NASA is also working on different methods of studying Venus besides the hovering vehicles. They made some ""simplified electronics made of silicon carbide,"" and they have been tested in a lab. If they are able to find a way to Venus, they will be able to find out so much more information about it.

They also went back and are trying an old techology called ""mechanical computers."" The mechanical computers were used in the 1940s during World War ll. I believe that using old technology may be a good thing for some people and a positive thing to look at. Some people look at technology nowadays and believe it is a bad thing, but if we are using older technology from a different generation people might think different of it. Also, as stated in the article, modern technology is very quick and efficient, but do not come to much use in extreme conditions. For example, if you put a modern day cellphone or laptop in a very hot condition , it will most likely melt because of the material used to make it. If we used older technology, the technology would be made by different materials and could come more in handy.

I think this may be another reason to keep exploring Venus because you could create so much technology and invent ways to go to Venus succcessfully. You could also find new ways to explore other planets and go to other planets. Creating this technology would lead to many great discoveries about our planets and our solar system. In paragraph 7 it mentions that they could build mechanical parts that can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. If these parts of made, there may be a benefit to the scientists and every day people. These products can be made around the world and can be a benefit to everyday society.

In my opinion, I do believe that going to Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. You could find out many new things, see new things, and learn new things. I think that scientists and astronauts have a good idea of how to do it and I think they will eventually go to Venus one day, or at least figure out a lot about it. People on Earth should take risks and be able to expand their knowledge about the world and about the other planets in the solar system, besides Earth. ",4,2,0.8754459619522095
329e332,"In the passage given, the author states that Venus would be a great place for studying, although it takes many risks to get more information based on it. The risks can be very deadly, but may give new information. There is so much more than NASA and even the world would like to know about Venus also known as the ""Evening Star"".

There is many ways as to why Venus would be great for studying. Venus is very simple to see from distant and is also known as Earth's twin. Venus is known as the earth's twin because it is closest to the planet in terms of density and size. There is much more information about Venus that needs to be found but may take risks. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system which can be very deadly if someone were to go look for evidence. For Venus being very hot, it can cause certain electronics to catch on fire due to the high temperatures. Not only the heat, but the atmospheric pressure is very high.

NASA is now finding ways to find further evidence on Venus and get evidence based on the information they have heard. They're finding ways to look at Venus in a closer distance such as using mechanical computers that were used in the 1940s. These mechanical computers made a huge impact during World War ll and they believe that this may help with discovering more on Venus.              ",2,2,0.8646903038024902
