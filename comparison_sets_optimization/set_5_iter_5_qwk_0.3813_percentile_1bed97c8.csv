942bd1e,"I read the article the challengenge of exploring is talk about the sun and star and it was said that everning star is one of the brightest points of the light in the night sky and is also said making it simple for ever an amoteur stargazer to spot. nickname is misleading since venus is actually a planet

in our aolar system venus is the second planet from our sun.

it also said venus is the closest to earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too. earth venus and mars our other planetsry

neighbor orbit the sun at different speed.

it tallk about how earth beging and how earth closest to the sun and other plants and its talk about how NASA send humans to study venus and it also talk about the national aeronautiecs and space administration.

NASA

is working onm other approaches to studying venus and they working on the veuns

surface and ahve lasted for three weeks in such conditions and is alson talk about the project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical

computers.            ",1,2,0.7543042302131653
198c196,"There are many people in the world who strive to meet their goals, regardless of the dangers it beholds. For the planet, Venus, however, The challenge for studying the planet is a big challenge. There are numerous examples to how studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. They can be communicated through these three instances: Venus has similar traits to earth, it is our closest neighboring planet,

One reason why Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers is becuase of the similar, Earth-like traits it has. Astronomers have made a hypothisis saying that Venus has similar traits to earth, as well as possibly having some sort of lifeforms developing on that planet. ""Astronomers are facinated by venus because it may well once have one well been the most earth-like planet in our solar system"". Despite the challege, Astronomers wish to explore venus to see if the traits on that planet are similar to earth.

Another reason why Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers is because it is are closest neighboring planet. ",2,2,0.7975800037384033
2822b94,"Have you ever wonder if a planet from outer space is safe? Today we will be talking about venus. Studying venus isvery great experience for a human to do, you get to learn about other planet. In paragraph 2 the author said "" Venus is the closest to earth in term density and size,""but is the planet venus safe for us to travel?

Numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study. Venus is a very hard planet to find out. For humans to study if it's safe or not. In venus a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. It's not safe for a human to go there cause of the acid clouds which is unsafe atmosphere for humans to breath in. Venus is a lot hotter than earth it it is over 100 its going to be hard for humans to breath.

On the planetâ€™s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. If the temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit it's very hot in venus and it's very dangerous for a human to travel there. It maybe the closest to earth but the atmosphere in venus is very dangerous for a human body. It is easy for a human to study venus. It's hard to get information if you dont get a chance to visit venus you don't learn abouy it. They stated "" NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus""

They think that venus could've supported various forms of life. They are trying to state that venus could've have human life and animals and plants on venus planet but they are still not sure if it's safe or not. In paragraph 3 they stated ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" They said venus was probably covered in ocean just like earth. Which mean venus is almost same as earth. Some people could've live in venus but they wasn't sure if it's safe or not.

To sum all this up I think that the more human study venus the more dangerous information they will get. No matter how much they study venus it is not safe and you will only get more dangerous. Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. In paragraph 6 they said ""scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Scientists are willing to have a personal despite risks just to learn about venus. Venus is a dangerous planet but almost as same as a earth that we live in venus clouds are acid.

eb094a5,"Exploring venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers. This is what the story is all about im only here to show you textual evidence that that is what the story is really about.

In the story the author says venus is our sister planet its surface is the closest to earth but its atmosphere is dangerously hot, 800 degrees to be exact. Therefor we would not be able to survive on this planet. not only is it very hot the atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide which is very bad for us to breath in.

If we explore venus what would we find, in the story it says that the surface is full of ""rocky sediment"" and includes familiar earth like features like valleys, mountain ranges, and craters. The only reason they are still studying it is because it might have had past life on it, and if the atmosphere was'nt full of acid and carbon dioxide we would be able to enhabit the planet if earth was ever destroyed.

Not only is the surface and atmosphere dangerous so are the clouds. The clouds are ful of sulfuric acids and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earth.Venus is a worthy pursuit because, we would get to learn about what type of life this planet used to hold and because it is so much like our home plane earth. Exploration is worth the dangers to figure out if we are the only life in the galaxy. Close exploratio must happen

in conclusion NASA must find a way to make heat proof suits that are able to withstand the rough pressures of this planet we all know as Venus. The author made many valid points on how dangerous it would be to explore te surface of the planet and all we can do is wait for the technology to advance enough to make indestructable rocket ships.

3cd6a2d,"Do you guys think that venus is dangers? Well for our part venus need to get up close and personal despite the risk or maybe they should think of them as challenges. Astronmers are fascinated by venus because it may once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it had proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus would need to get uo close and personal despite the risk and maybe should think of them as challenges.

Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in the solar system because people from long time had to covered the oceans to support carious forms of life to them just how earth is from us today. Also because the value of the returning of the venus seem to be a little difficult but there was other option to make a mission to be safe and productive to both of them for the astronomers to be by venus and know the planets in the solar system.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosvie sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere because they think that the challenging for venus might not be working for them but now they do work because the conditions are now more extreme then any human encounter out there and all of the environment can crush of a submarine. But then venus has the hottest surface temperature to any of the planet in the solar system that their is even when mercury is close to the sun venus can still be hot for the system being beside another planet.

Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus can be the closest planet to earth even in terms of size and density. Also each of the previous mission can have an unmanned and for a reason no sacecraft has been survived for the time of landing for more than hours or even minutes. Venus had more than three decades, but venus reputation for a challenge planet is for humans to work on and study for and to despite the proximity to it.

This is what I think the author suggests to the study of venus because venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk and maybe should think of them for a challenge, because astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may once have been the most earth-like planet in the solar system, even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere, and venus is simple to see from the distant but can be safe vantage point in earth and has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely to it.
