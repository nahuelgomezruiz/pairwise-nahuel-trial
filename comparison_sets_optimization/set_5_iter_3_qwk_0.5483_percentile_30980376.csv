de27b5d,"In the passage the author tells how Venus is ""a very challenging place to examie more closely."" She also explains the imortance of sending things to explore Venus and learning more about our solar system.

In the passgae the suther continually talks about how dangerous Venus is and how it is unfit for life and needs to be studied. She tells us how ""no spaceship survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This is very dangerous of course! Ninty-Seven percent of Venus's atmosphere is layers and layers of carbon dioxide and the average temperature being 800 degrees, which makes it impossible for a human to live and breath. Why would the author want people to go to the planet? A person could only survive a short amout of time, even with an oxogen tank.

Astronemers have been fascinated with Venus for years and say it has the most ""earth-like"" quality of any planet with its low valleys and high mountains. Some even think that it may have been filled with oceans and other life at one point.

In other words, in the future, Venus may be a new planet for earth to explore and visit. With new technology and new ideas, we may be able to see the beauty of Venus. In the passage it says that NASA is studing to send humans to venus one day to find new wonders and glories.

The author makes a point that just because somthing is dangerous, doesn't mean we shold not take risks to have more advances in technology and to push our limits and explore new places. One day earth will be so advanced in technology, not only will we be able to explore Venus, but other solar systems as well. In the end, every planet should be studied, not just Venus. Even though Venus may still have mysteris right now, we will have to wait for what the future holds to unlock them. ",3,2,0.8780730962753296
e61599f,"Studying Venus is important for scientists and so is knowing the dangers of the planet. The author states that people should know more about Venus and the risks it will take of doing so as it is dangerous. The article states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" (P8). Humans will evetually be curious about many things including trying to figure out more details about our neighboring planet Venus. No matter what the dangers are people will come up with many types of solutions to face the problems or difficulties that are stopping them from going further. The author gave a great idea and much detail about what people are trying to do to explore more about Venus, and also how risky and dangerous it is to explore Venus.Therefore, the authors idea about pursuing Venus despite the dangers will eventually happen at some point in time.

400105a,"ther artucule says envelope el study of venus in venus for the exploration

complete of venus he author claim that is dangerous for the estudent because en venus the temperute is more cold and is difficult , others thing very importan is that venus have 97 parcent of carbon dioxide and 800 degrees fahrenheit besides of the density that have he planeta venus other option is mars but not change much is same that venus only the temperature change on little but the estudents want know

the planet venus only with clothes special for have success in the study od he planet so the NASA wint more planets for when he planet eath have dangerous of destruction have more planet for life with no dangerous and survive the humans with water , oxygen , food , work , family , friends, law , reproduction ,and more that nothing happy . for this he all the planet earth need much money for pay el studing in venus the exploration and construct in other planet for survive , is all of the articule , i think that if is possible have life in other planet in all galaxy exist a opportunity is mi conclusion if have opportunity in other planet only lack more tecnology and money for all this process in others planet . all this says the articule only explain when i think and boliver of this theme .

a8b26b9,"The author thinks that studying Venus is worthy idea because the challege by Venus has value, explaining how challenge is the weather in Venus, and Venus is the closest planet to Earth.

First reason, the challenge by Venus has value. On paragharp 8 it state, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This means that humans are interesting to know more about the value that has Venus. Also humans are planing to go to Venus.

Second reason, how challenge is the weather in Venus. On paraghrap 5 it state, "" At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth."" This means that is doesn't metter how many miles they are from the surface, the temperature will be higher. Also the pressure of the air would be close.

Last reason, Venis is closest to Earth. On paraghrap 2 it state,""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in the distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planery neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."" This means that no one other planet is more closest to the Earth.

In conclusion, studying Venus result a good idea because when someone read ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" they can know about other planet. This article explain how is the life or would be the life in Venus, with the temperature, and the air pressure. This article makes the people imaginete how is Venus.

c881343,"Wouldn't it be extravagant to go and study another planet? That planet to explore, would be Venus. Venus is a lot like Earth. The most similiar out of all nine planets actually. There are risks of visiting Venus, but the pros out weigh the cons. There are ways of safely exploring Venus, from a distance away. There is a whole lot that we do not know about Venus. There could even be signs of a life form. Nobody knows. The author does a phenomenal job supporting that it would be a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers is presents, to visit Venus.

Venus is the most like Earth. There is a reason that scientist call it our ""twin"" planet. (Par. 2) Although the living conditions on Venus are a lot more dangerous than Earth's, it is possible to come up with the technology to have a device on the planet. The device would help scientist from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) study and find out a lot of information about the planet.

Scientist are intrigued about Venus. First off, it is by far, the most Earth like planet in our solar system. (Par 4) A long time ago, Venus was covered with oceans and maybe even life form. The author informs us about how it is filled with valleys and mountains. Sounds like earth to me. I think that the risk of another aircraft exploding would be worth finding another form of life on a different planet. As does, the author of this article.

They are talking about having a space craft go to Venus. That would be the first of many. There could even be human life in there. If there were to be human life in the space craft, they would have to hover around 30 miles above the surface of Venus. They would have to do that because the pressure is 90 times greater there, than it is on earth. It is also 800 degrees Fahrenheit, there. (Par 3) If the space craft could hover around 30 miles above the fray, the scientist could survive. It would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure would be the same as ocean level on Earth. From there, scientist could see if there is any life form, or oceans on the planet. Finding one of those things out would be worth it, despite the dangers that could come from it. These conditions would not be easy, but they are survivable. Another con about hovering above the planet would be that you can not get any samples of rock, or gas. (Par 6)

I still support the author's statement, that it would be worth taking the risk of studying Venus, depite the possible outcomes. Venus is Earth's twin planent. We could see how close the two really are. If there were humans on Venus or not. If there is water on the planet. A spacecraft hovering over the fray of Venus would be a great idea. Then, we could study the planet, and get more information than anyone ever could imagine. The condiions would be harsh, but the outcome would be worth it. Venus is a planet that is extremely similiar to ours. It would take risks to be able to visit it.

If there was life form, or it was possible to live on, that would be life changing.    ",4,2,0.8381965160369873
