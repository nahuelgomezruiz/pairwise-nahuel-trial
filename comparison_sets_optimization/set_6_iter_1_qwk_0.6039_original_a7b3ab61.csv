08def35,"The author in the story suggests of the idea of going to venus and studying as

''earth's twin''. That with the author's idea of pursuiting to Venus. Even through with the dangers of it by studying to go there does'nt sound too bad to think of. Venus is the closed planet to earth. That people are looking to traval to Mars well Earth,Venus and Mars are neighbor's there is a diffrentce Mars is not as hot as Venus, is closer to the sun.

Venus is some times closer to Earth the Mars is humans have send spacecafts to land on Venus but one thing about the dangers no human shoukd go it would be something to look in too. Going to Venus would be hard knoing that no spacecarfts surviced the landing for more than a few hours. Venus is something that is not a good idea knowing that the average is over 800 degrees is nothing to play with just to go to Venus.             ",2,2,0.8298183679580688
a9fbd0a,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" said "" Numerous factor constibute to Venu's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite it's proximity to us."" One of the reasons why the author said that is more than three decades ago not one single spaceship has touched down on Venus. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

Some facts about Venus is that sometimes it's called the ""Evening Star"". Venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Its often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". It's the closest planet to Earth interms of density and size and tye closest in distance too.

As people may think Venus is just a normal planet that spacecrafts can go to and explor the planet, but thats wrong. On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what people in Earth experience. The conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

As what the author wrote, all the reason and evidence explains that Venus is a really dangerous planet for people to land on the planet and study it without surviving.    ",3,2,0.8263807892799377
a789744,"Did you know that venus is a planet? Venus is the secondest planet from the sun. Their are three things that the author suggest that studing venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They are Venus vison from earth, Venus's atmosphere, and scientists discussing further visits to its surface. So it's going to talk about Venus is a worth pursuit.

First, is venus vision from earth. Scientist are having trouble seeing or examing more closely to venus. Venus and earth are mostly like the same that's why people call it Earth's ""twin"". It hard for a spacecraft to survied on the planet just for few hour, because human's are so curious about the world. But scientist are concern why people has not went to venus for a long time. One example from the test is "" Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecrafty survided the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" on paragraph two.

Secondly, is Venus atmosphere. What Venus are facing is there's clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Venus temperature's are very high than ours. But people also say Venus geology and weather present impediment. One from the article is ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather prensent additional impediments like erupting volcaneos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" in paragraph three.

Finally, Scientist discussing further visits to its surface. Astronomers were epressed how Venus use to look like beck then. Like people say that Earth and Venus are twin's is becasue long ago Venus had it oceans and could supported life. But now Venus has changes over the year. People want to vist Venus, but their are some concerns about going into Venus. For an example in paragraph four say's ""The Value of returning to Venus seems Indisputable but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive."".

So yeah those the three answers that supports that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it has. They are Venus vison from Earth. They both lokk different. Secondly is Venus atmosphere. The temperature's are different from earth. Finally Scientist having a difficult time going to Venus. Due from atrononomers going into space long time ago.      ",3,2,0.8610632419586182
41a6642,"Studying Venus can be dangerous but,there are some times where it's not dangerous. Venus is the second planet from the solar system. No spaceship has landed on Venus for decades. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Astronomers have been intreaged by Venus by looking like an Earth-like planet.

Venus was covered with oceans a long time ago. Venus has rocky sediment which are valleys,mountains,and craters. NASA has an idea by sending by sending humans to study Venus. Venus has a ground condition that is 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Air pressure in Venus is kinda close to the sea level on Earth.

Venus has a dense atmosphere and you can't see it with light. Researchers can't take samples of rock,gas,or anything else. Researchers see taking risks as challenges. Researchers are using machines to study Venus to know the knowledge of Venus. The machines are made out of silicon carbide.

The machines has lasted 3 weeks. NASA has another project called mechanical computers which is old technology. They're first envisioned in the 1800s. In the 1940s,it played an important role during World War ll. Those kinds of computers used to exist in those days.

In conclusion,its still ok to go to Venus. Venus has a lot of similarities to Earth. Venus is not dangerous. Even though it has hot temperature,its still good. Astronauts can go to Venus.",2,2,0.8337567448616028
1cbab90,"The author's claim in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is not well supported by the evidence provided, and the reasoning behind the evidence. The author claims that the planet Venus would be a worthy goal to pursue, despite the dangerous conditions and harmful atmosphere that the planet posseses. The author provides information on possible ways that we could overcome the challenge of landing on the planet Venus, but no clear reason as to why we should pursue this goal besides his own rationalization of a reason provided at the end of the article. Not only is the evidence that the author provides theoretical in the efficiency of the tools stated on another planet, but the purpose of the tools in collecting samples and taking photos is not descibed or elaborated on. Despite the risks, the author has no clear reason for the benefit of landing on Venus, and the tools that the author proposes do not support the idea that it would be possible to land on Venus and actively collect samples or take pictures.

The author claims that the value of returning to Venus ""seems indisputible"" in paragraph 4, but the only reason for this claim is his analogy that Venus is similar in structure to Earth. In paragraph 5, the author states that a possible way to approach the planet seems possible, because NASA had an idea to create ""a blimp-like vehicle to hover over Venus."" The author in paragraph 6 states that the blimp would only allow us to recieve ""limited insight"" on the planet, and we would not be able to take samples or take pictures due to the dense atmosphere. The author does not provide any possible way to collect samples and overcome this issue, besides stating how ""many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This statment provides no actual evidence as to any progress researchers have made, or if anything useful will come from the knowledge of the surafce Venus.

In paragraph 7, the author mentions a technology made of ""silicon carbide"" that has been tested by NASA, and survived a simulation of the conditions of Venus for three weeks. The author does not elaborate on the uses for these strong electronics, and leaves the reader guessing at the purpose of this technology. The author also mentions the use of mechanical computers used in the 1940s during World War II. The author speaks of how these computers make calculations by using gears and levers, but does not elaborate on anything else besides their increased resistance to ""pressure, heat, and other forces."" Once again the author provides no clear reason to the purpose behind the inventions, besides the possible survival of the technology on Venus.

Finally, the author presents his own opinion in paragraph 8. The author states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planent itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Paragraph 8, as the author has wrote, is entirely opinionated and dangerously optimistic. His reasoning behind the value of ""meeting the challenge of Venus"" is the equivalent to practice for humanity, because ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally indimidating endeavors."" The authors opinion of the research on Venus, as shown by this statment, seems to be entirely based on the idea that we should practice for future endeavors despite the dangers which is not only naiive, but dangerous.

To summarize all of this information, the author shows no clear reason as to why we should risk the resources and manpower to attempt an expedition on Venus. The author provides no purpose for the tools stated besides their increased survivability rate, and the author's opinion is forced onto the reader by stating in paragraph 8 that we should ignore the dangers and doubts of exploration to meet the limits of innovation. The author poorly supports his claim of ""a worthy pursuit despite the dangers"" and provides no facts or evidence for the benefits of humanity attempting the challenge of Venus.

bff9681,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The text states many facts and statistics; therefore, the author supports this idea well, for he/she describes why astronomers are amazed by Venus, what NASA is planning on approaching the planet, and explaining the type of challenge it is to explore this dangerous ""Evening Star."" Reading the passage, the author is convincing about the subject that he/she has chosen.

The planet, Venus, is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, as the author suggests. Supporting this idea, the author shows many examples, facts, and ideas why he/she thinks Venus is a worthy planet to keep studying, for the text states, ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" The writer describes that important studies come out of exploring Venus's reputation, even though it is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author supports the claim that Venus has many thrilling factors in Paragraph 3. Paragraph 3, Line 6 states, ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface."" The author demonstrates his knowledge telling the readers that Venus cause many disasterous events that happen all around the world.

As the author claims that Venus is worth studying for, Paragraphs 4 through 7 shows evidence about scientists still studying Venus as of today and why geologists and atronomers are so fascinated with the blazing planet. In Paragraph 4, Line 2 states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Scientists state that even today, Venus has features that look like mountains, as read in the passage. Testing his knowledge in the prompt, the author demonstrates that NASA wants to make visiting Venus possible. Throughout Paragraphs 5 through 7, it states what NASA's (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) plan is to successfully observing Venus from a up-close point of view. In Paragraph 5, Line 2 and 3 state, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" As being stated as a ""possible solution,"" the author shows NASA's solution is not an effecient plan, for Paragraph 6, Lines 1 through 4 state, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" In the authors statement, NASA need samples of rocks, gas, and other types of samples to have a full discovery of Venus. Because of the obstacle in NASA's way, they decide to make other approaches to studying Venus, for they understand that meeting to Venus' standards will take years. Lastly, as the author's final example on why Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents is in Paragraph 8, which states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Or travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The narrator claims that exploring all of our options that have dangers should not limit us as human beings to give up and quit. He/she states that we should move along all of the doubts and dangers and increase our imagination on all levels.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. As the author states many facts on why scientists should continue their research on Venus, he/she supports their claim well. The passage describes why astronomers study Venus as well as what NASA is planning to do to approach the Evening Star. The writer believes that although Venus has many dangers to humans, we should take the challenge exploring Venus offers to us and go beyond our limits to achieve the goal that geologists, astronomers, and scientists want to acquire.
