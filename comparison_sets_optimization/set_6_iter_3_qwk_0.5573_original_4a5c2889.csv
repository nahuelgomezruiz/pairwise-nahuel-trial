3b5ac80,"According to the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" This planet is worthy of the risks and issues of exploration. While the author maintains to cross his point, he uses evidence and facts to change the readers' ideas of this messy planet, by comparing it to more similar terms that are more pleasent to the reader.

First the author starts by explaining and describing the unabitable conditions of the planet. The author states that ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;"" Which are refering to the extreme temperatures of ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percentage carbon dioxide blankets."" Second he follows to counterclaim his points by questioning, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing fursther visits to its surface?"" This persuades the reader to question themselves, What is so bad about Venus? or more important What is so good about Venus? Which he replays and answers by comparing, once again, Venus with our own planet, Earth. He states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Changing the reader's idea or previous image, that he already provided, passing from an ""inhospitable planet"" to a planet that ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.""

In conclution the author crosses his point by using evidence of a very dangerous, and unabitable planet, and what it once was and how similar it was to what is now our Earth, or also ""Venus' twin."" As a way to persuade the reader into believing that Venus is worthy of its investigations.      ",3,2,0.8709551095962524
45b6989,"The author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" he provides a lot of information about venus. The author also provides ways we could get people on venus without getting them injured.

The author wants to study venus because it is basically the Earth's ""twin"". Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. It also is occasionally the closest in distance. It is not always the closest because mars and venus moves at different speeds so one might be closer than the other.

Another reason why the author wants to study venus is because not one spacecraft has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Thats because the spacecrafts cannot handle the temperature. Venus temperature average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. Those conditions would liquefy many metals.

The author provided facts from the National Aernautics and Space Administration (NASA) on one of there ideas to get people to venus to study it. There idea was to create a vehicle that can hover 30 or so miles above the venusian landscape. The conditions would not be as harsh the temperature would only be around 170 degrees fahrenheit and the air pressure would be close to sea level on earth. Those condition are much easier for a human to survive in.

The three reason i stated are why the author thinks that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They could create a vehicle that could avoid touching the surface . That also helps with the temperatures so humans can survive while studying.",3,2,0.9092141389846802
3834b70,"The author supports the idea when he said ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-Like planet in our solar system.' he supports the idea when he said that because he is saying that Venus is fascinated, Why because it's a look like planet that we live in Earth, their is other wonderful things down in Venus like he said there was ""The lanet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains,and craters."". The author finds it intersting when it comes to Venus, he's not the only one other people also would like to go to Venus in see what is in Venus or how Venus looks in face to face seeing it with your own eyes in flying out your self. Also this is dangers because not one space ship can fly out so far from out of earth to make it there then to came it come right back it will take years for it in also a lot of things to make the space ship go in come back safe, people that would like to do have to risk their life to that, you have to be sure about it before doing it. Earth levels won't be the same, ""Researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of venus."". We hope for them to find a way for the space ship to get where they wanna do in for the ship and the person going in the ship goes afe in comes back safe to Earth.",2,2,0.8567147254943848
c11476d,"The author made it clear to us why they feel like we should persue Venus. The author had many facts to back up his idea that exploring Venus is worthy but can be dangerous. The author described many aspects of what could happen if we go to Venus. The author is very interested about Venus and gave a thorough explanation of why we should pursue Venus despite the dangers by giving supportive details of how it relates to planet Earth.

The author gives descriptive details on how Venus is just like earth and why we should go there in paragraph 4. The authors says that ¨The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters¨. This part of the text makes it to where Venus is a safe place to go because it ¨includes familiar features¨ as earth does. Which makes the reader believe that their is another planet like earth out their in the Solar system. Venus having ¨valleys, mountains, and craters¨ shows how closely related the planet Venus is to Earth. By the author putting this into the text give us a visual of what Venus really looks like if we touch down and started to build a civilization their.

The author gives the reader a realistic condition of Venus of why it is worth it but dangerous. In paragraph 5 towards the bottom the authors describes the conditions by saying ¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth./ Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans¨. The author gives us a little scare of how it is dangerous because the temperature levels is ¨at around 170 degrees¨. That is very high and seems that no one would be able to survive there. The author also says ¨air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth¨ which is saying that the air level of 170 degrees is as close sea level so we could pontentially survive it. The author ends is by saying ¨Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans¨, which explains why he believes that it is dangerous but since it is survivable it is worth the try.

Furthore more, the author gave great explainitory details of what could come if we live on Venus, that of the good and the bad. Throughout the text the author explains ways that Venus is dangerous but can be liveable towards humans. The authors explains ways of how the human population is trying to get to Venus by telling us about NASA

tryna build technology that is suitable for those conditions. The authors explains their idea with strong arguments and facts that make it understandable to theit idea.",5,2,0.8125511407852173
860b60b,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives readers details on how Venus is Earth's ""twin."" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in both size and distance. The author discusses with readers why scientist want to explore Venus and how they are taking the steps to do it. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how humans have the technology, why exploring Venus is important, and by informing readers on the dangers of exploration.

First, the author supports their idea that the danger of exploring Venus well by explaining how humans do have the technology to explore Venus. The text gives examples of many advancements that have been made in order to explore Earth's sister planet. The author writes, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" This quote shows that the author's idea is well supported because it gives an actual example of the technology that has been created in order to explore Venus. Space exploration has been advancing and improving for years, so eventually humans should be able to explore planets with the worst conditions easily. Another way that the author's claim is supported is when they discuss that the technology needed has been around since before humans even traveled to space. The text discuss a device that has been around since the 1800s and played a significant role in World War II. This goes to show that humans have more than enough resources to travel to Venus no matter how dangerous it may be. In all, the author supports the idea that exploring to Venus is worth any danger that humans could face well by giving information on the technology that humans already have to do it.

Secondly, the author supports their idea that going to Venus is worth it because they discuss how important it is to explore Venus. The text discusses that out of all the planets in the solar system, Venus is most like Earth. The text reads, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like Earth."" This quote displays that the author's idea is well supported because it tells the readers how important exploring Venus is. By studying Venus, scientist could learn more about different forms of life. There could have been different plants and animals on Venus then there is now on Earth. If scientist were able to figure that out, it would be an amazing discovery and could improve the world's knowledge on space overall. Furthermore, the author talks about how much more convinient it is for humans to travel to Venus. Since space travel can take years, Venus is one of Earth's only options for exploration. So, the author's claim is well supported because they talk about how significant the exploration of Venus is for science.

Finally, the author's idea is well supported because even though they support the exploration of Venus, they still discuss the possible dangers of Venus. It states repeatedly in the text that Earth's conditions greatly differ to Venus's. The text says that ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This shows that the author's claim is well supported because they are acknowledging the fact that the exploration of Venus is not an easy task. Sending humans to Venus can be a fatal misson, so it is a good thing that the author can explain that, while still supporting their claim. Another way the author shows the danger of exploring Venus is in parapgraph three when it reads,"" These conditons are far more extreme than anything the humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This shows that the author's idea is well supported because they still acknowledge the fact that going to Venus is extremely danger for both humans and any sort of machine. In summation, the author's idea is well supported because despite the fact that they are for the exploration of Venus, they still informed the readers on the dangers.

Consequently, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their idea that exploring Venus no matter the dangers well by explaining how humans have the technology needed, why exploring Venus is important for science, and by informing readers on the dangers of exploring Venus despite the fact that they believe that it is worth the risk. The author of this text informs readers well and has an open mind while writing since they did explain the dangers. The readers can form an opinion on this subject since the author both dicussed how exploring Venus is important and how it may be extremely dangerous to explore. ",6,2,0.8355815410614014
8fae37d,"The author suggests that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus has her terrible conditions. He gives several examples. One of the examples is that, on Venus there is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets it. To even make it harder. The clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acidbin the atmosphere.

The second example is that scientists are still talking abot making a vist there when they know the surface is to dangerous. There are astronomers that are real amazed at Venus because they belive the Venus was once almost like Earth a really long time ago. Venus long ago was probably covered with oceans and could have had various life forms like Earth. Venus till this day has a rocky surface, valleys, mountains and craters like Earth. The value of retuning to Venus seems indisputable.

The last example is that NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Imagain a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the surface of Venus. It would sit 30 miles above the surface For it being that hogh it would avoid the conditions of Venus but it would still be hot. It would be about 170 degress Farhrenheit, but the air pressure would colse to sea level. It would not be easy conditions but it is survivable for humans. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but we should expand the very edges of imagination and innocations.",2,2,0.8853317499160767
