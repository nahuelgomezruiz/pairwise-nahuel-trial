Cross‑type scoring mechanics observed (consistent patterns)
Development and organization pay. High scorers write materially more (+~95 to +266 words; +6 to +14 sentences; +~1–2 paragraphs) with clear multi‑paragraph structure.
Clarity over sheer complexity. High scorers often use more commas (clause chaining) while reducing average sentence length, yielding clearer, more reasoned prose.
Evidence words correlate with points. Tokens like evidence, data, analysis, resolution, sources, proves, outweighs are overrepresented in top‑quartile essays within the relevant prompts.
Domain correctness matters. Accurate topical vocabulary (e.g., electors, resolution, atmosphere, liability, privacy) appears far more in high scorers; cross‑topic leakage (e.g., Venus terms inside FACS essays) is a strong penalty signal.
Conventions are not optional. Low scorers concentrate slang, misspellings (becouse, relly, differant), and rote closers (inconclusion). Even without a dedicated mechanics score, these correlate with lower overall scores.
Rhetorical scaffolding helps. High scorers disproportionately use discourse markers (however, therefore, overall, additionally, because), which signal structure and reasoning to raters.
