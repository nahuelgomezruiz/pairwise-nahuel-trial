000fe60,"I am a scientist at NASA that is discussing the ""face"" on mars. I will be explaining how the ""face"" is a land form. By sharing my information about this isue i will tell you just that.

First off, how could it be a martions drawing. There is no plant life on mars as of rite now that we know of, which means so far as we know it is not possible for any type of life. That explains how it could not be made by martians. Also why and how would a martion build a face so big. It just does not make any since that a martian did this.

Next, why it is a landform. There are many landforms that are weird here in America, and there is also landforms all around the whole Earth. Many of them look like something we can relate to like a snake a turtle a human... So if there are landforms on earth dont you think landforms are on mars to? Of course! why not? It's just unique that the landform on Mars looks like a human face. Also if there was martians and they were trying to get our attention dont you think we would have saw one by now?

Finaly, why you should listen to me. You should listen to me because i am a member of NASA and i've been dealing with all of this stuff that were talking about and people who say martians did this have no relation with NASA and have never worked with anything to relate to this landform. One last thing is that everyone working at NASA says the same thing i say, that the ""face"" is just a landform.

To sum all this up the ""face"" on mars is a landform but others would like to beleive it's a martian sculpture. Which every one that works at NASA says it's a landform and they are all the ones working on the planet and taking pictures.",3,1,0.8456171751022339
00f3984,"The Face that is on Mars, is just a natural landform. I am here to prove that it is just a natural landform. All of my reasons will come from the passage named ""Unmasking the Face on Mars.""

I know that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because, in the passage it is stated that when the spacecraft Viking 1 was circling it was snapping photos when it spotted a shawdowy figure like a human face on a region on the planet named Cydonia. After that though, scientisits figured out it was just another Martian mesa common around Cydonia. Next, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor Camera snapped pictures better than the ones that Viking took. Thousands of peole waited for when the image would first appear on a JPL web site. The website revealed that it was just a natural landform after all. Finally, in the very last paragraph it said, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are similar to landforms common around the American West. A scientist named Jim Garvin said ""it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Gavin also stated ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.

So therefore, all of the reasons stated above prove that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It formed a long time ago and that is something to figure out in the future.",2,1,0.8667903542518616
0105e2e,"The face on Mars was not made by aliens, and it only looked like a face because of the shadows. Michael Malin even took a better picture twenty two years later that showed it wasn't a face, but some people weren't satisfied. Three years later they took an even better one, showing that it wasn't a face at all.

This is not a face becasue the author says in paragraph two, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows"" Some people didn't agree because ""it was winter in April '98--a cloudy time of the year"" and to disprove this they took a better picture in the summer. In paragraph ten, it says ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia""

the picture that he took was even clearer and it can be seen that nothing alien related is in the photo. It is all just a mesa.",2,1,0.8330004811286926
01267d1,"The Face was dicovered on May 24, 2001. It was discovered by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" But the Face is just a natural landform discovered on Mars by NASA.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the face. It was discovered that there was no alien monument. On paragraph seven, the text states, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos....There was no alien monument after all."" This proves that they found out the Face was not an alien monument.

But many people were still not satisfied so, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went to Mars for a second look. On paragraph ten, the text states, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" On paragraph twelve, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" So, the Face that they found on Mars was just a natural landform after all.

Using evidences from the texts, we learned that the Face was discovered on May 24, 2001. We learned that many people believed it to be an alien monument, but it was not. The Face got looked a second time, on April 8, 2001, but with the camera's absolute ""maximum resolution.""

014eba6,"As I know from images and researches that aliens could possibly exist by the looks of it . Not so Postive about it , but why would there be an human face on mars when people aren't on Mars everyday of there lives. Also that by seeing pictures of hwo aliens look there similar too us in a way , but the mouth is weird shping like it's not a human mouth that people think it may be . Makes you have second thoughts and makes you want to investigate more on the "" The Face On Mars "" . Each year we have something new on this face of mars.

So we investigate more on these pictures to see exactly what were trying to find out because it doesn't add up how would I big hu,man face be on mars. doesn't make since too me. Yeah and like "" Garvin "" says we don't pass over a human face very often so something isn't right here. The scientist put there all into this to figure out what there dealing with.

So finally in 2001 we've came to an conclusion and find out from all our investigations that it's really just a ' mesa ' It's an Middle Butte in the Snakwe River Plain of Idaho It's the same height of as "" Face on Mars "".",1,1,0.8307039737701416
0151c0f,"The so called "" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.

The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.

The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.

My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.

See? It just doesn't make much sence.

Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!

In conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face. ",4,1,0.8068215847015381
01d6e7e,"The 'Face' on Mars is just a hoax. It seems as though the mound on this planet is just a mesa. If you don't believe me, then listen to me very closely. The very similar face on the side of Mars can be very defining but not a single astronout have researched at the Mesa up close and personal. But even if it was made by aliens, it still wouldn't tally up right?

The 'Face' was first noticed in 1976 by Viking 1 spacecraft, circling around Mars, after trying to find its sistership, Viking 2. As Viking 1 was circling around, it spotted a likeness to the human face. And the mound was found in Cydonia, a very well-know area on the Red Planet to house mesas. As the years went by, they looked more into the mound and Scientists concluded that it was just another mesa, but this moutain-like hill had shadows that resemble the human face.

As you review this very peculiar picture, you can see that it just resembles Earth, mostly in Western America. That certain part of America are very popular for its mesas and buttles (which are the same as mesas). There may be more out in the solar system, mnaybe even more in the whole universe itself, but in the end of all the discoveries, they all end up being coincidences. Maybe one day, we'll find extre terrestrial life, but for now, we will just make more and more discoveries until we don't have anything else to find.",3,1,0.8770935535430908
01ec1a3,"""What's that thing on the moon dad?"" ""That is a land form, it's not on the moon but on Mars a planet far away from us."" The landform on mars in natural, even if it looks like a face. You can see things closeer up in a digital image, there are many equivilent landforms on Earth that are natural, and lots of theories are exagerated.

The landform on Mars is a mesa, and there are many like it on Earth. As the text states, ""It remids me most of Middle Buttein the Snake River Plain of Idaho..."" Just because something that is here and it's known it is natural doesn't mean that on another planet it was made by or is extra terrestial.

Theories about the mesa on Mars being from other lifeforms was exagerated. As the text says, "" The Face on Mars has become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, rado talk shows- even haunted grocery stores for 25 years!"" Over time the face on Mars probably got twisted, just like a game of telephone. The truth probably got mushed with Sci-Fi.

A digital image in taken in 2001 showed nothing but rocks no tools, and the picture was very shap and discerning. The text states, """"Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the photo covered 1.56 meters insteaf of 43 meters per pixel. As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This means that if there were tools, construction equipment, or anything

from ""extra terrestrials"" that they would be visible in the picture. There was nothing there but landforms and rocks.

In 1998 the best picture taken was when Mars was foggy and skeptics and theorists said that markings could be hidden. But in 2001 a new picture was taken and it showed that the landform only had the markings the rest of the planet. The red dust and rocks.

The landform on mars in natural, even if it looks like a face. You can see things closeer up in a digital image, there are many equivilent landforms on Earth that are natural, and lots of theories on the face are exagerated. Before you speculate, have your facts straight.   ",4,1,0.7361718416213989
0226c11,"The face on Mars is a natrual landform created on the planet. Some people believe it was created by aliens or that's an alien artifact around the planet. The face that we see in the pictures is mostly not possible for aliens to create and for sure there are no tracks of any alien life around.

In the article it says There was no alien monument after all. This explains my answer by saying that the face was created naturally and not an alien artifact. Also in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars it explains another reason to show that the face on Mars is just a natural landform created by the planet in the article it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa—landforms common around the American West"". This also explains my answer by comparing the natural landforms on Earth and comparing it to the face on Mars. The third reason to explain why the face on Mars

is a natural landform is in the beginning a reason to why people think it's an alien creacted landform or artifact is because of the pictures where not made clear enough during 1976-1998. After getting the 2001 picture it's easier to see that it only creates a face when there are shadows.

The picture taken in 2001 can also make it clear that it has a natural form for example it's not perfectly shapped and it has a few cracks almost like a rock. In the article it says “As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"". This explains my answer by explaining how the image taken in 2001 was a better picture of the face on Mars and they could actually work on it better and discover it without any problems to stop them along the way. Also the image taken in 2001 can help explain to those who believe that it was formed by aliens that it was a natural landform created by the planet naturally.

You will be wondering what theirs a face on Mars,well we do not know for sure. Some scienitst are saying that the ""Face on Mars"" are provided from aliens (Aliens are living in Mars?). They discover the face in 1976,that is when they took the photo they lastest image is from 2001. Also another scientist are saying (am one of them) that ""It is just a rock"". It has natural grow & its not a mask & just a rock. But who knows no one knows.

Did you know that 50% of scientist think that it is a mask from aliens & the other 50% of scientist think it is just a natural landform. ""A few days later NASA unveilded the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation. . .which resembles a human head. . .formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes,nose & mouth."" And i still think it just a rock,if it were an aliens face or an human face tell me how did it got their.

Do you still think that its still their (i do so) because it is a rock,rocks dont die,they are hard rocks we have & they never die. But am not that convience how can a rock change by its years,but also maybe because it is a different type of rock (its in the space) I thinking that the rock changes by the time.

Its just a rock that looks strange dont all rocks look strange they are all unique & some strange ones they are a lot of type of rocks in the life,dont think the the rocks are the same. Were different.",2,1,0.8620442748069763
0269b85,"The picture shows a face but how long ago was that picture taken, 1976 was when the first picture was taken. In 1976 they had a camera with pixels thats not so good. The picture was taken like there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gound or Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were. It was taken 43 meters away.

In 1998 the picture was taken again and the camera was getting better and better. The 1998 picture looks more clear then the pitcure that was taken in 1976. Over time the picture got more clear. 2001 the picture was taken again and it was taken 2.5 km-wide stripes away. This time it didnt even look like a face. The Middle Butte looks like a snake from in the air but doesnt make it a snake. You saying aliens made that too the way the water moved made it like that .

So facts show that at one point it looked like a face but wasnt done by alien the way the picture was taken is the reason why. You could use the moon as an example. Everyone use to think there was a man in the moon just by the way it looks but clearly there isnt a man in the moon.

There are many of these in Cydonia and they're called Martian mesas. This Martian messa looks as if it's a face because of its unusual shadows that creat the illusion of eyes, a nose and a mouth.

In April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michale Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture, that is 10 times sharper than the orignal one tooken by Viking 1, of the face on mars. This picture finally revield that there was no face on mars, but a natural landform.

This didn't satisfi many people. They thought the alien markings where hidden by a haze, since that was the time of year where that part of mars gets clody. So on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor took a final look. Then, when they finally found it Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Well yes it would. Unless it were like a carnival and it travled around. But it was a giant rock. In this paper im going to prove to you that this face was not made by ""aliens"".

Twenty five years ago we found what looked like a face on mars. We didnt know if this were something caused by aliens or just something that was natural. Well that was untill we came back to take more pictures of this so called ""face"". We came back around twenty two years later. Just to find out we caught the face at the right time when we took the first picture. We found out the picture was takin in winter on the planet and it was a cloudy day.

But it has to be alein life form that created this. They can easely destroy what they make. us humans do it all the time. And why would you guys at NASA put something like this out in the world for people to see? If it wasnt real life on anouther planet. Do you like playing games with us.

So we also know that there is no life on mars because we have cameras that can capture the smallest of sheds. On camera so if we saw a little house on the camera we would think there is life on this plante for sure(11). at NASA we didnt know exactly what caused that face at the time. We realeased it so we could sow you guys we may have found something. Now we have proven that we didnt find anything. We can also tell you the ""Aliens"" didnt destroy anything because this rock is still there.

This artilcle was givin to you to prove that aliens didnt cause this ""face"". We know that there are no aliens on mars. Here in 2016 we have rovers up on mars we know nothing is up there.

02f6c8a,"Since the time of its discovery, the ""Face on Mars"" has baffled many people. Its resemblance to a face has caused it to gain much popularity, which has even led to a movie being made about it. Unfortunately though, there are people that would like to believe the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars. They have named and stated a number of arguments about why it is a sign, and even have claimed NASA is hiding it from the public. This is not true however, as the Face is simply just a peculiar looking landform. Yet, several counter-arguments and points must be made to drive home the fact that the face is just a landform.

Many theories that the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars have been spawned by the creation of books, magazines, and even movies that have been made about it. Almost all of the stories these things tell about the Face are science fiction, with a key emphasis on the ""fiction"" part. Sadly though, some people have chosen to accept these ideas made by an author or producer as the truth. Most of the theories about the Face were made for good stories to the people, so that their books and magazines would sell more. But, one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars.

The people who claim theories that aren't from commercialized stories regarding how the Face is a sign of alien life are a little more credible than the others, yet still can be easily proven wrong. This is because their main, and in many cases only, argument centers around a 1976 photograph of the Face. When another photograph was taken in 1998 however, the picture showed that it was simply just a landform. One counter-argument to this is that the camera must've malfunctioned or the picture wasn't clear enough, in which there is one fact that makes that counter-argument dissolve. The camera in 1998 reportedly ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."", which would lead to the assumption that the 1976 photo wasn't clear. If that's true, then the ""Face on Mars"" actually isn't a Face at all. Simply put, the Face is a natural Martian landform.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is certainly an interesting landform, but is in no case a sign of alien life on Mars. All theories about how it's a sign of aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven, and has been further proven through updated pictures that it is just a landform. Even though finding a sign of alien life would have been more interesting, one must always stick to the facts to know the correct solution. ",5,1,0.8560894727706909

It also said that it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh on paragraph 2, ""Only this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"".

The discussions of this being a face are all over the place, poeple believe that ailens have caused this ""face"" on Mars surface. There are three different pictures, one from 1976, one from 1998, and one from 2001. In the first pictuere you see a outline of a face and a mouth, but back in the 70's the quality of technology wasn't very advanced. In the first photo, due to poor quality, it is just a land mass that has trhe outline of a face. There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago. In the article it says that the camera that was used to capture the 1976 photo only had 43 meters per pixel, in other words meaning that there's almost no way in telling what the first picture was or resembled.

In 1998 and 2001, you can see the picture more clearly due to the advancement in technology you clean clearly see that there is no outline or resembalance of a face. The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa. In the '98 photo the picture is foggy and unclear because it was winter on Mars and they had to take a photo through a cloud. When the photographs began to be released online there was many observations but many realized it was infacr not a face.

After all the questions blew over, Directors began putting images and shots into movies which again started raising talk. In movies or films there are special effects people that are able to enchance photos and clips. So most of the photographs and clips are not actually NASA recorded and theres a good chance most of them had been edited to make more money on a film or movie because people want to know more about myterious things like this.

Concluding with what i said at the beginning, the pictures we see are nothing more than a mesa. Science it to greatly advanced now and if there was any form of life on any other planets NASA would atleast have an idea of it.

In the article NASA unveiled the picture for all to see and THEY captioned it ""huge rock formation"" . Which basicly means even NASA doen't think it was aliens who created it. Also after the articles states what NASA captioned the picture, it says ""formed by shadows giving the ALLUSION of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Its just an allusion not even a face really.

Also, the aticle says ""there was no alien monument arter all."" if NASA really believed aliens did that I don't think NASA would release it to the world. I'm sure the government is strict on them on releasing things to the public. NASA probably wanted people to pay attention to them so they can have their one minute fame. Skeptics think alien marking were hidden by haze. Come on really, all the great technology NASA has and you think it was hidden behind clouds.

The technology they have is great. When they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it. After they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. NASA said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were. Marvin, from NASA says it reminded him of landforms created on Earth, so if an expert that works at NASA

thinks that it was created by a landform, then why do we think it was an alien or aliens that created it?

In conclusion, the ""face"" was not created by an aliens or aliens, but was just created by a landform.    ",3,1,0.8248022198677063
034dbcf,First off I don't think there are a such thing as aliens so i don't think that would be the case. Im here to tell you guys and ladies that this is a natural landform built from rocks piled up and all around each other. If you think the aliens did it how could they have done it if it's sticking outside the ground instead of inside. As you see in the pictures when the years go by the cameras and pictures get better asthe face structure starts to disappear and it makes it look like a bunch of rocks. They don't know if they actually seen a face they said it was winter on that side when this picture was tooken. So there were clouds and just a lot of stuff covering the cameras when they took the picture. This is a natural landform from rocks and other stuff but i would see why you would think that. It is kind of weird to see other things like this on other planets that don't even have human life or something close to it for this to happen. You should have already known it wasn't a face when JPL web site said it wasn't and it was just a natural landform like all the other craters.,2,1,0.7677361965179443
035e589,"Have you ever gtten your hopes up for something special, but you secretly knew you wouldn't get what you wanted? That is how some felt once they discovered the ""Face on Mars"" wasn't actually a face. Many convincing facts led NASA's employees to believe this natural landform was actually a human face. However, there just so happened to be a few more facts and pieces of evidence to tell otherwise.

In September of 1997, Cydonia became NASA's number one priority when Mars Global Surveyor arrived to the Red Planet. The article says this was eighteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin explaines how they felt this landform was important to taxpayers and they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Beacause this mysterious form exsited and NASA payed so much attention to it, it shows that they only used solid facts to explain how this landform was created naturally and not by aliens.

It was not until Apri 5, 1998, a year after Cydonia became their priority, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, as stated in the article. It also says Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture which was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This comes to show that NASA did not just go off one photo taken eighteen years before hand. Eager web surfers were anxious to find out something juicy, such as alien life form on Mars, but to their surprise the Face had occured naturally.

The web surfers and many other people were not satisfied with the outcome and were not going to give up on their hopes, but neither was NASA. The critics said how the ""Face on Mars"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was cloudy on Mars when the photo was taken. NASA then prepared to look again. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew in closer for a second time. Garvin stated, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of veiw."" The pixels in the most recent pictures taken spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also adds how you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that it is the clearest image you could take and if there just so happened to be things such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks the picture could have clearly captured them.

Although many wanted to believe the Face was anything but a natural landform, NASA used strong facts and evidence to fight the arguement and convince people otherwise. I strongly believe The Face on Mars is natural and was not created otherwise because they used all facts and has three different pictures one of which could have spotted things other than the landform, but did not. Nothing but the truth was caught on camera and that is that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform, and nothing more.               ",4,1,0.821773111820221

It would not make sense that a face would be on Mars. I belive it is just a landform because it looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Globel Surveyor flow over Cydonia and took a picture and it was a natural landform. The pectures this time were ten times sharper then the ones from the original Viving picture. There was no alien monument after all. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa.

On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor took another picture on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, caompared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. With this images if there are any objects there you are going to see it.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. These landforms are common to the ones in the American West. They remind us most of the Middle Burre in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

I know that the second picture was taken on a cloudy day and it was not all clear. The origanal picure did have a differnt shadow also. There was however, a third picture taken and that was on a clear day and it showed that it was just a lanform. The origanal picture only had 43 meters compared to the one in 2001 that had 1.56 meters.

In counclusion the face on Mars was just a moon. There were two pictures taken after the origanal picture and they both show that in is just landforms. I belive it is just a landform because it looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.     ",3,1,0.8329408764839172

But Mars Orbiter Camera team came to find that it was not a human face but just a simple natural landform.

Many people believed that it was an alien artifact. Even few sciantists believed this too. But on April 5, 1998, Mars global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the frist time .Mas Orbiter team took a picture ten times sharper then viking photo.

The landform that is actually shown on mars was a commom landform around American West.

In conclusion you can see that this image was studied very hard on to find out was it actually was, wich is a natural landform found in the American West. An if you still don't believe just think about it. The image taken that reaveled it to be a natural landform had each pixel in the 2001 spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 Viking image.",3,1,0.8852928876876831
0376bcb,"Twenty five years ago a weird picture showed up in the Jet Propulsion Lab by a NASA's Viking 2 spacecraft. It took a picture of what seemed to be a human head on planet Cydonia. People in the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised at what they saw. Though many thought it was something formed by aliens, scientists figured it was only another Martian mesa. They said the shadows is what made it look like a face.

The shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.

Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.

It's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.

This shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars. ",3,1,0.8718349933624268
03ff4c1,"First of all, NASA only gets their information from research and cameras which they depend on to help them with their research too. According to the text it states,""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" Well, the Face of Mars does indeed exist but there is not any proof that there was life on Mars once because it seems impossible. To add to that it has been twenty five years since the discovery, and there is not a for sure explanation that is logical because some people think there is smething behind it.

Second, now to the conspiracy theorists, they think there was life on Mars like aliens. Anything is possible for one so they can't be entirely incorrect because even a few scientists got to thinking about the Face of Mars could be an alien too. According to the text it says,""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" Even scientists believed it too and NASA has logical thinkers in their coorporation too.

Next, on April 8,2001 they got a picture of the Face,""Malin's team captured an extraordinary using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So overall the technology for the camera was very equiped.

Therefore, the conspiracy theorists may have some thoughts that make NASA ponder about. Such as, NASA could be lying to us all and making us to believe that there is no such thing as extra terestrial objects and such. Here are some interesting theories that government should give us answers on, is the world really round, do aliens exist, is NASA lying, is there really a so called space, could aliens be demons, and overall is the government lying and hiding a bunch of theories from us. In fact they may have those answers to our natural questions about life?

In conclusion, NASA goes by research and proven facts and conspiracy theories have nothing to back them up. There are so many questions about life and Man do not have all the answers. We do not even know of all the organisms that could be living in the ocean. We may never know these questions, but NASA goes by research, cameras, and approximations about these discoveries and us the people just have to believe in what they are telling us.

The Viking 1 was taking snapshots of the Cydonia when it spoted a shadowy figure close of a human face. This snapshot was sent to the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2. After careful review at the mission controllers at the Jet Propulision Lab they found out that it wasn't a human face. It turned out to be Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Although this one had an unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

After a few days of the finding of the ""Face"" NASA unveiled the image for all the public to see.

The ""face"" on mars has been a very common or popular story, when 25 years ago viking 1 spacecraft snapped a photo of what looked like a two mile long ""face"" that seemed to be staring back at the camera. Many were suprised and shocked at the sight and many conspiracy theorist belived it was a alien artifact but scientist found and believed it was an martian mesa common enough around Cydonia. It takes the shape of a face but also unusual shadows made it out to look like an egyptian pharoh when mesa's were more commonly found proving the ""face"" theory uncredible.

At NASA we feel like the ""face"" found on mars is just a natural land mark or a mesa. At NASA we think it is a lava that takes form as an isolated mesa. Although it looks like a face and some theories say it is bona fide evidence of life on mars, we have factual evidence to believe it is a mesa like in the snake river plain in Idaho and also commonly found on Cydonia around where the ""face"" was.

Yes, the landmark resebles a face and shadows make out a eyes, nose and mouth shape to also contribute to the illusion that it could be thought of as proof of aliens or alien civilizations on mars but, there is really no for sure credible evidence that could explain and prove it is an 100% acual bona fide face. It is more likely and more proven to be a simple mesa such as some of the mesa landmarks on earth. Along with the people who feel it is an alien artifact some scientist also believed it was indeed an alien artifact also but sadly it is not altough at NASA we wish we could uncover an Alien civilization on Mars.

In conclusion, this ""face"" is nothing more than a Martian equivilent of a mesa or butte. Although the popular suspition and popularity of it being a ""face on Mars"" it is nothing more than a landform that is also common around the American West. Not only that but, Skeptics and authors felt it would be a good way to attract attention to Mars which could lead to the truth being streched without physicl evidence to back up their theories.",3,1,0.8791508078575134
046efe7,"I belive that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it is not possible for people to live on Mars, there are no such thing as aliens, and why would there just be a head shape object and not the rest of the body. In the passage it says, ""There was no alien monument after all."" Also how could there be life on Mars. Mars has no oxygen so people can breathe. All NASA wanted to do was ,"" engage public and attract attention to Mars."" also in the text it states that NASA said,"" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shodows giving the illusionb of eues, nose and mouth.""

The Face on Mars is not real because it is just a natural landform caused by erosion and broken rocks. An example from the text is, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.""

Secondly another reason the Face is a nautural landfrom is because it is not possible for people to live on Mars. Studies have shown that there is no oxygen on Mars and people can not breathe there. Also the preasure of the gravity on Mars would be too much for a human and could crush their bones and musles. Thirdly, why would the rest of the body not be with the Face. That proves that the Face is just a natural landfrom create by erosion and rocks because if the Face was there on the ground why wouldnt the rest of the body by with the Face.

In conclusion the face is just a natural landfrom becuase NASA have send rovers up to Mars to take pictures of the Face and NASA said themselves,""when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. So that is why the Face is just a natural landform.

04bc9b6,"Face On Mars

Have you ever wondered if there was possibly other life forms out there, living on other planets? In 1976, NASA'S spacecraft ""Viking 1"" was circling Mars and taking photos. Suddenly, it spotted a form that almost looked like a human face. Some conspiracy theorists assume and consider it to be evidence of other life forms, while NASA knows it's just another landform on Mars. It's common to have forms like that around Cydonia, it's also proven that there is no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually show that it's a martian similar to land forms here on Earth. All the evidence NASA has brought upon us has proven that it is just another land form on Mars.

Firstly, it is common around Cydonia to have land forms as such. NASA

has taken plenty of pictures of Mars to know that it's quite common for there to be land forms like this. Although it may have unusual shadows, NASA could only wish that there would be possible evidence of ancient civilization on Mars. It being common, creates a slimmer chance of it being crafted by other life forms.

However, when Mars Global surveyor in April 5, 1998, Michael Malin was able to snap pictures with his Mars Orbiter Camera team. These pictures were much more clear. When the image was first revealed on a JPL web site, they realized it was only a natural landform. There was no alien monument to be seen. This strong evidence shows that with a clear image, there is no sign of any alien monument.

Furthermore, the pictures show that it's a Martian equal to a butte or mesa lanforms, seen around the American West. This evidence clearly shows that it's related to Earth land forms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. This Earth landform is only a lava dome. The height is similar to the height to the face on Mars. These landforms being equal, show that it's normal to have land forms such as the Face on Mars.

But, perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze, and there could be possible evidence that aliens are indeed out there. Maybe a closer look into the image would clearify these statements. However, as likely as it sounds, the pictures taken were accurate, with an advanced camera.

Nevertheless, the chances of this Face on Mars being created by aliens is proven false. NASA

may hope that someday they might discover evidence of other life forms. Until then, they have supporting explanations on why it's not. For it to be common to have land forms like the Face on Mars, gives enough clearification. As well as, there being no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually showing a land form similar to ones on Earth. We never know what the future holds, so will NASA ever discover facts that support the conclusion of there being life on other planets?    ",4,1,0.880280613899231

Most NASA scientisis believe that this Face on Mars is a natural land form but, some believe that it is not natural and was formed by Alians. Many Scientists also think against the thought of the formation on Mars being made by an ancient civilization that lived on Mars. Scientists that are against the theory of the face being formed by Alians argue that there are formations on Earth that are also formed how the one on Mars was and that this is natural.

Many Scientisis believe that this is a natural landform because it is like some of the other landforms in the Western United States like the Butte in the Snake River Plain of Ohio. Scientists believe that both of these landforms were created by lava domes because the two formations are around the exact same height and are therefore believed to be created in the same and natural way.

Have you ever saw something so strange you just had to get a picture of it?! Well if you have, ive done the same! It all started 25 years ago around Mars!

Mission controllers back at the Jet Propulison Lab had to be really suprised of what we have found on Mars. As NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling aound Mars and found a figure similar to a human face, believe me when i say it, Yes a human face!!!Although scientists found out it was just an Martian Mesa, i still find it pretty cool!

A few days after the photo's were taken, NASA has decided to show everyone and let everyone know about this Matian mesa.The caption resembled a human head. The author thought it would be a good idea to attract attention to mars, and it slowly, but surely did!

The human face like structure has became a pop icon, it has appeared in many places and thing such as a film, magazines, talk shows, apppeared in some books, it even made it to the grocery sotre checkout lines ofr 25 years!!That is a really big deal for just a structure on mars!!Certain people thought the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, which is there own opinion.

time, Mars Global Surveyor flow over Cydonia. Come to find out, there was no alien monument after al!But no everyone was satisfied with this photo.

The camera was really bad considering it had to go through wispy clouds just to see the face.Mission controllers prepaired to look at it again.After a while Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a 2nd look on april 8, 200l.

04fcfb0,"A commonly known and disputed topic is the ""Face on Mars."" You may believe that what is known as the ""Face"" is actually a formation created by aliens. Pictures from twenty-five years ago show the ""shadowy likeness"" of a human face. If you believe that the nearly two mile formation was staring back at the cameras was a face, the main reason this formation could not possibly be a formation of a face created by another life form on a different planet is because there is no scientific evidence of aliens to be discovered.

The Face has recieved national recognition as being a representative for most pop icons, Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. But because the Face is a popular icon, the way the face is portrayed to have been created and used for has been taken out of context by audiences around the world. Spin-off series about the Face and aliens have promoted the idea that aliens are real, although there is no scientific evidence to be found. The media that used the Face has promoted audiences to believe that the Face is actually a formation made by aliens, as a way to keep their audiences interested and to make more incom by their audiences believing their predictions of aliens.

As a result of the majority of people believing that the Face was an alien artifact, NASA decided to fly over the formation again to take a new picture using an updated camera that was ten times sharper than the camera used originally to take the first pictures, in order to investigate if he formation was really made and occupied by an alien life form. The new pictures concluded that

what seemed to be an alien life form was actually just an actual landform. Yes, there may be different and unusual kinds of makrings on the land form because it is located on a different planet where there are different conditions occurring.

What has now been proven to show that the Face is a natual landform is that the landform is the Martian equivalent of a buttle, which are landforms common around the American West.

Whether you believe or don't believe that the landform on the Red Planet is made by aliens, there is more authentic evidence that is relevent to showing that the landform is just a natural occurrence, rather than evidence presented by science fiction enthusiasts. Although the formation may seem to have the appearance of a face, there are also many natural objects on Earth that have the appearances of faces too.

With that being said, Do you think these people that thought the Face was created by aliens have proof or any type of evidence?... I don't think they had proof or any type of evidence because it was on Mars people csn not go around assuming that it was created by aliens if they have no proof. People would have to go to Mars and see for theirselves. Just because it was founded on Mars doesn't neccesarly means that it was created by aliens.

Next, What makes people think that the Face was created by aliens?. Is it because they knew that it came from Mars?... I strongly believe it is because all these people knew that it came from Mars, i'll tell you why i think this. I think this because it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stores as stated in paragraph 5. So, because it appeared in so many places people started to make assumtions, and really believed that the Face was created and made by aliens.

Futhermore, How does people think this if they just recently found out about the Face?. Well, people think this just because it it was the most popular story or myth going on at the time and since it came from Mars that it was created by aliens because they know people doesn't live on Mars.. But, that doesn't mean human beings do not visit to see what it is like in person.

I would prove them wrong, because there are many objects that have some sort of illusion in them. This story tells how the Face is just a simple landform which I believe it is. It's a natural landform because when astronauts were circling around the planet they found it to be a simple landform. Seeing new things that look just like human things can just be an illusion to our eyes, for example the red planet could have had the ""Face"" carved into it.

I think that there are objects that can always fool our minds especially planets. There are certain planets that give us many illusions and we just want to go and figure out why they make us have such an illusion towards nonimportant things. The image of the Face that was spotted in Mars first appeared on a JPL web site, which means that the image was first taken by NASA. I believe that aliens do not exsist still and there could have been no way that the Face was created by one of them. Neil Armstrong was the first astronaut to ever be on the moon and when he came back from the moon he left his steps on the moon. The Face could have been created by someone who has visited Mars (Red Planet) even though the planet almost is the same temperature as the sun they could have taken a pocket knife and began to crave in a human face.

The Face was spotted on Mars, but the certain place that it was spotted was a lava dome, what is a lava dome you may ask?. Well, a lava dome is a place that is isolated from a mesa and can be up the same height as the Face on Mars. There are still some scientist that believe that the Face was someting that aliens created when it could've been a person or even people that wanted to leave a trace left behind. Maybe they left a trace left behind because there probably wasn't anybody who has been there before.

The Face was spotted by NASA and when NASA spotted the face they made sure to zoom in on what looked like Face. I believe that the Face was carved or traced behind due to a human being there, even though they say aliens live in Mars there could be no way that a alien did a cetain thing. Aliens could not have been the ones who left the illusion of a Face because some studies show that aliens were not exsisting at that time. The story also does not state anything towards aliens being on a certain planet especially Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that things you leave on a planet can not always be something a alien did or has done. Our mind has such a great technique to play with our minds, especially if we see things from above like the Face was seen from above. I do believe the Face was just a natural landform. I believe it was just a natural landform because there are some things on planets that have such and illusion into them.",4,1,0.853215217590332

In 1998 scientists took another picture but this time with better quality, but people still believed it was a human face. In 2001 the people at NASA took another picture with even better quality that clearly showed that it is just a landform, or a mesa. It could of been created by Martians, or naturaly formed. Simlar structures are on the Earth called mesa and butte usually are seen in the American.

The structure on Mars is just a natural landform, because over the years scientists have developed better cameras to get a better look at the structure. After years of studying and getting higher quality pictures, they came to the conclusion that the structure is just a landform, or a mesa. It was a big trend in grocery stores, radio talk shows, and even Hollywoof films, for 25 years!

Scientists also include to support their statement that if there were airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, that you could see them because the quailty of the camera was so good. So if you could see small structures on Mars, then you could see a giant human face. But some people to this day still believe that this could be a sign of Martians.

The scientists at NASA made it a priority to obtain a clear photo of the face on Mars, due to the unlikely possibility that it is in fact, an alien artifact, for which they wanted a clear answer. When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, it snapped a photo, much clearer than the one obtained by the Viking. When the photo surfaced online, it proved to be nothing but a natural landform. However, some people were not satisfied with this discovery. Conspiracy theorists began to theorize that there were alien markings hidden by haze, which caused for another search to get an even clearer picture, which was not easy. The photo obtained on April 8, 2001 was a phenomenal photo, which proved the face on mars to be a mesa, nothing but a happy accident, you could say. Conspiract theorists also believe that NASA is hiding evidence from the general public, which is absurd. A discovery like that of an ancient alien civilization on Mars would benefit NASA.

It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.

NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a ""good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Afterwards, many conversations and arguements were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.

Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether or not alien-life does exist or not. More goes into a theory if you can support it with proper evidence. ",3,1,0.9181665182113647

Only few scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact. But the article states that when NASA unvieled the image for all to see, the caption that went with it noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembled a human head... formed by shadows giving an illution of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Also in the article it says the author even reasoned ""it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention on mars"".

The fact that when the face appeared on the Jet Propultion Lab monitors was short lived also proves that it wasn't a alien because if it was they would have probably started doing test and research on it right away or if not right away then soon.

On April5, 1998, when Mars GlobalSurveyor flew over it for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharpper than the orginal photo revealed it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument.

Of course not everyone was happy. It's much cooler to have it be a alien artifact than a natural landform. People weren't giving up. The face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter of April 98' when the camera on bored of MGS had to peer through clouds to see the face. Skeptics said the alein markings were hidden by haze.

Mission controlers prepared to look again. The article states that ""we just don't pass over the face very often"".

On April 8, 2001, it was acloundless summer day; the Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look. In the image things were three times bigger than the Vikings one so you could easily see if there were shacks or small airplanes.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. These are landforms common around the American West.

This all proves that the so called ""Face on mars"" was just a landform and not from alien artifacts. The shadows from the landforms made it appear to look like a face but it was just a cauincedince. ",3,1,0.8387400507926941

The ¨Face¨ on Mars is not an actually face at all. If there were life on Mars, this life definitally wouldn´t be enormous as it say in the artical ¨Unmasking the Face on Mars¨ in paragraph one. It states, ¨An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.¨. Another reason why the face isn´t life on mars it that in paragraph twelve Gravin talks about how this face remind him of similar landforms back on Earth. Garvin also says how there are common landforms around the American West, so if there was life on Mars why would there be simlar landmarks on Earth? The staement Garvin say is that ¨It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,¨ Garvin also mentions that the landform in Idaho is the a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same size as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion, The Face on Mars isn´t any type of life or aliens because there are similar landforms in the American West of the U.S. like the lava dome in Idaho that Garvin says is similar in size and it looks the same. Another quote in this article is ¨An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be looking at back at the cameras.¨ now if there was to be life on Mars, the life would not be enormous I can tell you that.

Though it may be easy to believe that this landform is the creation of aliens on Mars, it is just a natural rock formation on the red planet.

Aliens not been proven to be living in the universe with a secret ancient civilization. Though some people might believe this is untrue, NASA has yet to find evidence to support it. If scientists knew Cydonia was created by aliens, they would definetly want to investigate this further.

0689c67,"The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.

There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.

If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.

They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.

While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins.

06c3953,"""Face"" the Facts

The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the ""truth"" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing more than a natural landform.

First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it says ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.

Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.

Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.

To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to

In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.

In paragraph 8 it gives a reasonn on why maybe the alien markings showed up on the face. The camera that took the photograph of the face had to peer through a wispy cloud to see the face. Perhaps the alien figures had been caused by the cloudy surface. In paragraph 6 Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program said, "" We felt this was important to taxpayers.

Althoug targeting Cydonia was not easy, on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team from Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia flew and took a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. Soon the image showed up on a JPL wed site, revealing what the truth was a natural landform that caused the face to appear on Mars.",3,1,0.8876192569732666
06ef6d4,"Many people think that the Face that was discovered on Mars might have been created by aliens. But thats far from the truth. There are many reasons why that face could have shown up there. A natural lanform maybe? Mesa? Anything but aliens.

Although there is no evidence for there being life on Mars, many skeptics say otherwise. We believe that is was just a natural lanform that was mistaken for looking like a face because the landform gives off the illusion of having eyes and a mouth. Its unusual shadow is believed to only be a mesa and many people are fascinated with it.

Some people counter will be you are hiding it because you dont think the people of the United States can handle it, or it can be too dangerous for us to comprehend. This all could be good reasons not to tell but, considering the fact that there was not evidence of life, how can there be some sort of alien? My rebuttal to these claims are it just had happened naturally and everything is going just going how it was made to be and NASA haf found positive and reasonable points that it was just made naturally.

We have different landforms made everyday and the come out looking rather unusual but that doesnt mean that there is anything out there that is capable of reaching us. If the skeptics are so sure that that was made with the possiblilities of there being aliens on Mars, then they need the statistic and evidence to support why.",3,1,0.8997658491134644
0728321,"The Aliens on Mars

In the text Unmasking the Face on Mars NASA says that there was a face.Then they went back eighteen years later.Then another three years and said it was a natural landform.I also think that it is a natural landform because there isn't really aliens or anything other living thing on mars.Some people would there are lifeforms on Mars because of water which is ridiculous.There could be clouds and water on a planet without a lifeform. In these next few paragraphs i will tell you why it is a natural landform.

One reason that the so called face is only a landform is because it could've been a rock formation.There could be rocks in the shape of a head because of other rocks and erosion.And how the got the eyes?...shadows.Shadows could've been a be part of this because its a planet pretty close to the sun.So from which way the Viking 1 was facing there could've been shadows.

Second reason is on April 5,1998 when they went to mars again with Mars Global Surveyor...while thousands of anxious web surfurs were waiting the image JPL wedsite revealed it as a natural landform. People were upset so they said since it was a cloudy haze there could still be a face.Which made it worse because people actually believed that.

Third reason is if there was a face form on earth and no one would freak out by it because there is actual humans on earth.So if there were aliens everyone would freak.Am I right?So if there were real aliens you wouldnt know what they actually look like but you do know from evidence from ""actual pictures"" that people supposedly took.

Some people think its the other way around.Some people who aren't like me actually believe in aliens.They think since in 2001 they sent a better camera on a ""cloudless"" day that there were Martians.And since they have the camera whith better pixels they could see more clearly...so clearly that you could've have seen Egyptian style pyramids or even a small shack which was almost impossible in the Viking 1.

To conclude, I think that the face was a natural landform made by erosion.It would most likely to be impossible for it to be a martian, not saying it is but I highly doubt there would be martians.",4,1,0.8349205851554871

When NASA posted the picture on a website, it revealed that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, also proving that it was not an alien monument in the first place.

But still after proving that ""The Face"" was a natural landform, still not everybody was satisfied. Some people still think that since it was cloudy at that time of the year, the camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy, white, and fluffy clouds to be able to see the face. Skeptics were still saying, ""Perhaps the alien marking were conseled by the wispy clouds.

I believe otherwise because, landforms on Earth are like that and these assumptions are made by conspircy theorist not by NASA officals. now here are my reasons.

The face on Mars is made by natural landforms and not by aliens. One thing of evience by a picture by Mars Global Surveyor, in paragraph 7 it says ""...anxious web surfers we're waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" That's a big piece of evidence that it's not made by aliens. Also, my second piece of evience that supports that the face on Mars is not made by aliens in paragraph 12 is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the Amerian West"". ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That's my first reason I believe that the face on Mars is landform made.

The fact that conspriacy theorist make the assumption of the face on Mars is made by aliens. You have to understand that those remakes are not all true they are just theories which is just provided by evience but, not always right. In paragraph 5 it says ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of like on Mars-evidencd that NASA woud rather hide, say conspiracy theroists."" ""meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" That evidence was never what NASA said that's conpiracy theorist said and it's not true. So, mark these words and think about your decision, i think you should change you're mind about the alien theory to a natural landform with this information.

The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" from the evidence is that it's a landfrom instead of aliens making these faces on Mars. Don't always go by what the internet or media says, go by what real experts say. Maybe, you people that think that it's made by aliens I hope my reasonings and evidence is strong enough to change you're mind. Now what do you think of my evidence did it change your mind?             ",4,1,0.881337583065033
078f997,"Many people and other scientists believe that the Face was created by aliens. But, I definitely disagree. First, the Face may be shaped like an actual human being's face, but it's not an actual human being face. Clearly, there's sufficient evidence to prove the Face was not created by aliens. For example, there aren't any alien monuments, and there aren't any aliens! Pictures were taken ten times, to make sure that we got clear vision of the face. Even when picture of the Face appeared on the JPL web site, some people and other scientists, thought the Face looked like a natural landform. That's because a a shadow figure kind of looks like a human face, that doesn't mean it's an actual human. Also, never have I ever seen an alien. Contrary to popular opinion, aliens don't even exist. That's almost saying the aliens are going to take over the world.

Then, I have never heard of aliens creating the Face, knowing aliens creating anything else.

The face is a natural landform because it's just a shadow. Before, when Nasa's viking ship took pictures of the shadow, their camera could have had a bad angle and probably tried to make the shadow look like a real human face.

Next, never have I have heard of a viking ship capturing pictures of any aliens. Or, have I never of anyone capturing pictures of any aliens creating the Face.

In conclusion, I still think that the Face is a human landform because, once again, there aren't any aliens. Also, there aren't any alien monuments. I think everybody is just exageratting about the whole thing. Also, people could just be freaked out about what they had heard. Some could agree with me, or some couldn't.

If you look closely at the pictures took within the time period of 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a mistake because you look at the (Face on mars) and you think what!? is that true?. I do not think it is real because if you look at the pictures from 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a increase in technology such as photography. If you were to look at the pictures then you can easily tell its not a face because for one there is no face there anymore another reason is it looks like a mesa as one reporter said.

My personal opinion is that it was just something to get the community aroused and it did indeed. In the passage it said ""It even haunted grocery lines for 25 years!"" and also it played its part in movies and things like that. And only recently in 2010-2016 has there been ANY proof there has been any life or there may be any life there what so ever. The reason of that is they found a river or something I can't exactly remember. And also they (N.A.S.A.) don't believe that there could be any life there because the atmosphere is so hin and so hot they believe that it would be hard for something to grow and live on the planet mars.

07e11fc,"The Face on Mars

There is a great population of people who believe aliens exist and cause strange things to happen and space crafts to appear. Many people know that it is just science fiction and that there is no evidence showing that aliens actually exist. This has been going on for decades and the believers need to face the truth. They can belive as long as they want, but there is no evidence.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, but is a natural landform. Meteors and other space rocks strike the planets, and even the moon. Those can be a possible cause of the Face on Mars. With astronauts exploring Mars to see if it is capable of supporting life, the Face could be caused by the humans collecting large amounts of the planet and walking all over it. Aliens are nothing but a fictional character in the many Hollywood movies.

As humans with the sense of sight, we are used to seeing faces on a daily basis. We look at clouds and depict them as something we have seen before. Or a tree that looks like a face was made out of it's bark. It is understandable that you could see a face on Mars because that is human imagination. The Face is just a natural effect of what caused it to happen. Sure, we might not know about everything that goes on in space, but we do know that many people are interested in the fact that Mars may be able to suport life.

Scientist are doing everything they can to know more than enough about Mars. They have rovers and cameras to look at Mars from Earth and be able to study it without traveling all the way there. There are many photos and videos of Mars and what you might see there, but no aliens were found. Their equipment is high quality and no blurs or scratches could be seen as something it's not.

For those who support the belief that aliens roam Mars, they can invest on the discovery, but find it wasteful. The Face is just a landform and you would need evidence to support your alien claim. There are many photos that were taken over time of the Face and the differences could be because of erosion or asteroids. Many things go on in space, but alien activity isn't one of them.

In addition, what the picture actually shows is a landform common around the American West.

On the other hand, some people might say that the Mars Orbiter Camera team didn't take the photo cleary than the original Viking photos or they could think that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars but, on April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" said Garvin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

This famous picture has gotten a lot of attention in the media. What some people may not realize is that the photograph was taken through clouds. The text states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" Some believed alien markings were hidden by the haze, but perhaps the haze was instead covering up detail in the landform that would show that it is not a face, nor an alien monument, but instead just a natural landform. NASA also happened to have technology that could clear up this picture. The technology used to explain this photograph was described by stating, ""You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This shows that NASA has the technology needed to explain this image. After using this technology, the image was revealed. The text claims that the photograph shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. It is also said in the passage that these are common lanforms in the American West. It is clear that this landform is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary, and it certainly is no alien monument.

In 1976 the Vikking took the picture that was bellived to look like a face. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over mars snapping pictuers that were ten times sharper than the first picture of then the first picture taken. By increaseing the sharpness of the picture it showed that it was a land form. The time of year that the first picture was taken it was a cloudy over the Red Planet. This could have made shadow that made the form look like it had eyes and nosie.

The last time the picture was taken (2001) the picture was taken in maximum resolution. This maximum photo if taken of earth you could see the pirimds in Egypt. So if there was anything weird the picture would have shown it.

In conclusion the picture taken in 2001 '' actually shows is the Martin eqivalent of a butte or mesa----landforms common around the American West.''(paragraph 12).

In the 2001 photo it was summer, so there was no shadows to cast the facial features as in the 1976 photo. If Nasa really discovered life on Mars they would tell the public because it would be a huge discovery. These conspiracy theorists say aliens are so smart, well if they are so smart why haven't they contacted us.

Why would these oh so genious aliens waste time on making this face? I'll tell you why, because they dont exist it was just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The people of Nasa have done as much as they can with this natural landformation. They took another photo in 1998 after the first photo because they wanted to prove it wasn't aliens.

The photo in 2001 proved that it was not an alien creation. These theorists say all these things that make Nasa seem so protective and amke it seem like they hide information. If Nasa were hiding information why would they release the photo in the first place. If it were alien markings and they knew about it why take two more photos, to prove the theorists were wrong. One day they will land on Mars, and Nasa will prove to us that there are no ancient life forms there. When they land and prove us wrong the conspiracy theorists will stay say they are lying.

The theorists love to make people believe what they want because it's all about the best conspiracy. If one were to have the better conspiracy they would knock their compition out of the way. They make money on how many subscribers they get and the better the conspiracy, the more subscribers.

Some poeple will always doubt what Nasa really searches for. They don't understand that Nasa is not in it for personal gain.

May 24, 2001 was when the Face was first spotted. There were no other other landforms or artifatcts spotted on this mission. This is the first problem. If there were aliens that previously inhabited the plant, why would there be no other evidence? The only factor making it appear to be an Egyptian Pharaoh was the shadows casted on the rest of the structure. Though Michael Malin was able to get closer,clearer pictures of the landform, it still did not give straight evidence that aliens exsisted. If the Face did prove that aliens did once walk Mars, why would they be Egyptian? Scientist can only compare the structure to what they know, which is not much. Since the Face is equal to a mesa or butte, how would that be possible? Mesas and buttes are not caused by man, but by erosion and natural processes. The Face was most likely formed by coincidence.

Though there is no exact explanation for the Face on Mars, it is still interesting. If you belived in aliens, you would believe in is an artifact left by ""Martians"". If you do not believe in aliens, you would simply believe it happened because of natural processes as if it were a mesa or butte.

But clearly the face is natural landform. So today im going to give three reasons why the face on Mars is a natural landform on Mars.

Well the first reason the face on Mars is just natural landform because people have checked back since to see more evidence. For example on April 5,1998 Mars Global Surveyorflew over Cydionia. Michale Malin and his Mars Obiter Camera team took a picture ten imes better than the viking photos. Than they put the picture on the web whene revealing a natural landform. No alien monument after all but even after that people still wasn't satisfied enough so sooner or later they did it again.

So on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor went close to Mars for a second look . They rolled the spacecraft25 degrees to the center of the face in the field of veiw. Then Malin team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera maximum resolution. Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best1976 viking photo.

Now to prove this theory NASA has put there picture on the enternet for all of to see. In 1997 NASA felt as that the this important to tax payers, so photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot. The next year Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so (MOC) snapped a picture ten times sharper then the picture took in 1997. With that picture revealed that face was just a natural landform and that there is no sign of alien monument. But the picture was nott satifieing enough yet.

First, the picture proof. Pictures were taken, very clearly and sharp showing it's just a natural landform. The picture that was tooken actually was more than ten years later, so of course there was better cameras getting it in clear picture it's pretty obvious what it actually is. Even years after that another picture was tooken and showed it with even better quality, prooving that is no alien creation.

Next reason is, we live now in a better world with better technology and we can do new things. So a picture was taken on a cloudless day of the face. This time we zoomed in and each pixel inside the

picture spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Why this is important is now we can take a picture and get a closer look and not make it much blury, back then zooming in was not so good making it closer but really blury. So maybe if you zoomed in back then it would be blurry and look probably more like and alien artifact, but now zooming in actually works better and more efficiently making it easy to see it's a natural landform.

Finally, we come to conlusion. Even though you can argue and say ""The picture was taken on a cloudy day and the alien marks are coverd by haze."" We can come back and say ""The pother picture was taken in summer on a cloudless day"". And there were no alien symbols to be found.

For example, scientists say that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so we can see what the face is, a natural butte or mesa.

In the article, it states that on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed that the face was just a landform, and no alien monument at all. The monument does look like aliens made it, but this fact just shows that the Face is fake and is actually is indeed a mesa.

This tells you why I believe that the Face is fake and is actually a basic landform. Even though the Face does look like aliens made it, it is more likely that it is a natural land form. These facts prove that the Face is not alien made.",3,1,0.9196937084197998

With there own proof. Once I would get a response, I would tell them there isn't much proof that aliens exist. Including, that there are also no signs of life on Mars.

Also, I would also state that the Face was only a natural landform of a mesa, made by natural causes on planet Mars. It was probably most likely made by a sandstorm. But, surely not made by an alien. I would also tell the person who I am arguing with, that aliens are just fictional characters in movies, book, etc. made up by normal people.

Another important reason thhat you can tell that the Face on Mars is only a landform is that in the pictures show, the face has more features as a normal mesa. And you can tell because of the more advanced technology to improve the photos shown. With that reason you would point out how the face has revalent features of a landform. To prove that statement in the text, it states that the landorm just appears as an Egyptian Pharaoh face because of the shadows on Mars.

09c4d28,"I would tell the person that the ,famous face, on Mars, is a natural land form and not created by aliens.

In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of Cydonia, where the face was located, and the pictures show that the face was actually a butte ,or a mesa.

The face actually became popular in the mid 70's and had many conspiracies behind it. When the first picture released to the public, it quickly gained traction with fans. The picture was taking by Viking 1, when it was snapping photos for it sister ship Viking 2. After releasing the picture to the public, it became extradonarily popular, the face was starring in movies, books,magazines, and even radio talk shows. Then rumors started to spread that NASA

was hiding the fact that there was life on Mars.

In September 1997,NASA's number one priority was to photographing Cydonia, where the face is located, when the Mars Global Surveyor arrived at Mars. So on April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia. When the pictured appeared online at a JPL website, thousands of people were dissapointed that it was a natural landform and not some type of a alien monument. But there was still some belivers out there and said that Cydonia is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude,on April 98', which is a cloudy time of the year

for Mars. They also said that perhaps the alien markings were hidden by a haze.

Three years has went by and the Mars Global Surveyor finally drew close to Cydonia. It was a cloudless summer day,so therefore it couldn't be an excuse for a haze or clouds to be blocking the alien markings. After NASA had set up the Mars Global Surveyor in a spot to get the face in a pefect position, they caught a photo usuing the camera's absolute resolution. The picture caught Mars equivalent of a butte or a mesa.

In conclusion, the face was a natural landform,that resembled that of a human face. Also, the face was a big pop icon and gave people the idea that there was some type of lifeform in ,the Red Planet, Mars.   ",3,1,0.8827967643737793

On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of possible landing sites of its sister ship Viking 2. Viking 2 had spotted the shadowy likeness of the human face. Then, an enormous head about two miles from end to end looked as staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia.

Back at the Jet Propulsion Lab the face appeared on their monitors. But, we figures it was just another Matian mesa, around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Also, NASA showed the image for all to see, and the caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Authors thought it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The answer is yes the ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon.

But, few of us scientists believe the Face is an alien artifact. On April 5,1998, scientist, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the Face to prove there was no alien monument. When the Face image was finally posted, anxious web surfers saw that it was revealed as a natural landform and no alien monument at all. Everyone wasn't satisfied. Skeptics were saying that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.

On April 8, 2001, we drew clse enough for a second look. One scientist said, ""If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A scientist, Gavin, once said "" it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

The Face is just a natural lanform and not alien monumument at all. I think this because we all have taken pictures and used evidence as to why the Face isn't an alien monument.

Do you really think aliens made this face? I'm sure that is is just a natural landform on the Face on Mars. Now since people, such as you believe it is a alien artifact this is becoming a extrem priority for us

NASA. So we are beging to do some research on this.

First we sent the Mars Global Sureyor(MGS). They arrived to the Red Planet in September 1997, 18 long years after the vikings mission had ended. But we continued because we felt it was important to our taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good look at it.

That being said, on April 5, 1998, MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time Michal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team got a picture about ten times clearer than the Vikings first pictures.

Why I say it's just a landform is because, it's just a huge rock formation,it isn't an alien monument, and Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object shown in the picture.

First,the Face is just a huge rock formation. Mars is a rocky planet. Rocks can form any shape they aren't created by humans. There isn't any sign of life on mars so no one could go there and make a face on Mars' surface.

Second, it isn't an alien monument. An alien wouldn't make a human face just for fun. In plus, they wouldn't even know what humans looked like. They wouldn't even know how to get to earth to see what we even look like. So trust me aliens are not real!

Third, Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object showing in the picture. This could prove that there isn't anyone or anything on mars that could've made the face. This could prove almost anything in any picture of the Face.

In conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. It's just a huge rock formation, it isn't a alien monument, and Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object in the picture showing.               ",3,1,0.887381911277771

If you look at the picture from 1976 it can resemble a face, but if you look at the 2001 picture it just looks like a landform. Here's another thing, the one from 1998 looks like volcanic activity is emerging, which could be the case. These pictures contain important information, and data that can be analyzed, which will help NASA find out more about this.

Let's go back to the Viking 1 spacecraft. This machine was built in 1976, which could possibly mean the machines camera was broken, or malfunctioning. One major factor in this is NASA. NASA is a company who study's life outside our atmosphere. When they launch probes into space it costs millions of dollars to do so. When they find real life outside our atmosphere they get paid for all the research they've done.

Then there's the rumors that certain people spread around. Usually it's untrue, but there's a possibility that it's true. These are theorists, they do this to gain popularity for themselves, or sometimes even money. The ""Face on Mars"" did gain lots of popularity for itself among time.

The eyes, nose, and mouth are probably crevices on top of the mesa

Though I can assure you that this is a nautural landform that takes the shape of a face. Sir, I am asking to you please take what I am about to say into consideration. Just listen to me and let me explain to you the scientific proof of how this landoform takes on the label or identity of a face. Yes, I get it with the eyes, nose, mouth, and everything. It is very persuasive to looking like a face. Though it is not an actually face it is a nautural landform that takes the details and characteristics of a face.

I want to draw to your attention that when the face is spotted the shadows of the lanform project onto itself making if look like it has eyes a nose and a mouth. It is just crazy how science works sometimes. But if you just sit and think about it logically it makes sense. But yes, there was a great degree of surprise among our mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. It all came off quite strange. Though when we put it into scientific calulations, the result came back as a nautural landform. And that the eyes, nose, and mouth were just an illusion from the shadows.

Now after hearing all of the scientific calculations, proof, and resonings I hope that you understand where I am coming from. And the fact that it is just a natural landform.

0b28ade,"Do you really believe the face on mars was made by an alien? Well my name is Sydney, and im a scientist here at NASA.Im here to tell you the truth about the ¨Face on Mars.¨ Lets begin by telling you the how the face on mars was discovered.

In 1976 ¨Vikings 1 spacecraft was snapping photos for possiable landing sites for Vikings spacecraft 2,when a human face appeared¨At first scientist like myself thought it was another Martian mesa,but something was different about this one. There was an odd ¨shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.¨

NASA took the image and unveiled it for the whole world to see. Once the world saw this image people went crazy over it. The ¨Face on Mars¨ was in ¨movies,magazines,radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stroe checkout lines.¨ But then people started taking it to far and coming up with there own ideas. People started to say it came from aliens,I know how crazy.

Some scientist at NASA even started to believe what the people were saying. Then NASA decided to go up to mars to get another picture of it 18 years later. They said it was important to taxpayers. ¨On April 5,1998, When Mars Global surveyor got over there his team snapped 10 pictures of the face.¨

When the pictured was taken it was ten times sharper than the Vikings picture. So when the picture appeared on the JPL website,it revealed a natural land form. So After all it was not an alien monument. But wait were not done yet. People were not satisfied because they said the picture was taken at the wrong angle and on a winter day which was cloudy.

Then on April 8,2001 on a summer day and no clouds,Mars Global Surveyor was close enough for a second look. With the teams camera they captured an extraortdinary photo. With this picture you can blow it up three times bigger to see what it really is. The team blew it up and showed it was a butte or mesa landform,most commonly found around the American West.

During all of this I have learned that what looks to be a face was actually a landform. The Face on Mars turned out to be neat because it got used in movies,and ect. It also led people imagineation to think that well maybe there was life on mars before us. So next time what you see can look like something, but turn into something way different.

NASA had sent out a Viking one spacecraft that was looking for a spot for the other Viking two to land. As the Viking was looking around it had saw somthing that look like a face and it took a picture of it and sent it to mission controllers. But the Viking one was not there when the face was first formed so NASA don't know how it got there or know how it was made.

NASA had never told nobody but the people that work there but after a coulple of days later they had showed the world what they had saw on mars. They had called it a ""huge rock formation that resembles a human head and mouth, eyes, and nose"". Some scientists belived that aliens made it and once lived on the planet mars at one time. All the people know is what they think or know what NASA told them how it got there. But really they dont know the date it was made, how it was made, what it was made with but all they know is what they got from a picture.

Know if some one frome earth was there and made it and was there to take picture's of them making it. It would have been a nother story then NASA can say that they know how it was made, what it was made with, what date it was made, and who made it.

The average conspiracy theorist might think the picture of the ""Face"" was created by aliens but science and reasearch shows otherwise. Many people connect space with aliens but it's all really fiction. Everyone wants to believe that those comics and fairytales they used to read when they were younger are actually real. So any piece of information from mars that could be the slightest bit connected to earth makes everyone go bananas! Here is why your ideas and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas Are way off.

First, How are you putting out their ideas and beliefs but we have yet to see you guys give any evidence whats so ever. See, The team at NASA has actually done research and it's our job. When we went out to the sight where the ""Face"" is located Us and other scientists figure it was just another Martian mesa, Also, these are common around cydonia, Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, If this accusation was in deed Truthful why in the world would we hide this from anyone!? It would honestly help us and make us even more financially stable.

Even when we revealed the picture it engaged many common citizens and it attracted attention to mars. So, even if the whole alien thing was true it would really benfit the people. Not only are they going to learn about possibly Alive aliens but they get to learn even more about mars and how they function in space.

Also, We've provided all the evidence that we possibly can. We even went back out to The sight and took pictures again to prove these you and the rest of the conspiracy thoerists wrong. When we went back out to the sight we used a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

Now you and many might say ""Well i still don't think their telling the truth, their probably hiding something because it might discredit them and their business.""

Well, NASA and the rest of the scientist have done all we can. Our job is to explore space and find new things that might help us on earth. So, after all the reseach we've done. Plus all the trips we've made back out there to provide the community with evidence and pictures and you guys still don't believe us thats your problem. When conspiracy theorist provide us with 100 percent credible and sufficent information then we can look into it more but for now you guyses Arguement is full of opinions.

We spend thousands and thousands of dollars each mission just so we can have evidence and Information that is accurate. We take our jobs very seriously.

Many Web sites, magizenes and people do not have enough information to correcty assume that the Face on Mars is an Alien monument or creation. Many people just guess without really having adiquite information. We do have enough information to know that when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Mars and took pictures of the Face it was not Alien made.

We know for a fact that the Face on Mars is not an Alien creation. The first Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) or the Viking 1 took blurry photos of the Face on Mars and we could not clearly see the object. Twenty-five years later the MGS was sent to take better quality pictures of the Face and when it came back, the photos were ten times more sharper than the Viking 1´s. Now we could clearly speculate that the Face was just another Mars landform.

On Earth there are simialr landforms like the Snake River in Idaho. We have found that the Face is a lava dome under the surface of Mars. We understand how much of an influence the Media can have and you shouldn´t believe them. Again, they do not have as much information as we do on the Face on mars. Thanks to our new pictures from the MGS, we can safely say that there is no Alien temple or monument on Mars.        ",3,1,0.9021139144897461
0c5ec1c,"The ""Face of Mars"" is clearly a natural landmark that, in a low resolution camera, looked like a face. Until there is proof of life on Mars, there is not a single chance that something couldv'e made this. It is actually a very common mesa on Mars and this is why it cannot be man-made.

First of all, the photo taken at first and released to the public was not very good. The difference between the photo from 1976 and 2001 is extremely noticable. The picture from 1998 looks the most like a face, but it is still quite a stretch to say that it is a face. The high-resolution images and 3D altimetry completely disproves it and shows what it really, a mesa.

Now some skeptics might say that NASA might be unreliable and might have changed the photo. There are two things wrong with that arguement. If NASA had discovered new life on Mars, they would most defineitly share it with the public. Everyone would know that there were other lifeforms on other planets, and this would be extremely benificial to NASA. They would get all the funding they need to do more exploration deeper into space. They would get more scientists interested in making technology for space travel. They would get more brave volenteers for space travel. The second thing wrong is the difference between sources of information. All the info people have about the face is either from NASA itself and pop culture like movies or magazines. So if you trust magazines and movies more than a well supplied and well known orginazation like NASA, then you don't have as reliable sources making your own arguement not very believable.

In conclution, skeptics don't have any reliable proof that hasn't been already disproven.",3,1,0.8559433221817017

In addition, scientists have proven that the Face is not made by aliens and that it was made by a natural cause. Then they started taking more pictures.

The first picture shows that it was just taken when there were clouds and couldn't really tell what it showed. They waited for a day without clouds and took another photo. The picture they got clearly showed that the Face wasn't made by aliens and was just a land form.

The scientists proved it was a land form by comparing it to others similar to those on earth. When word got out it was kind of disapointing for the public. There were so many movies about the face on mars and it stayed for a long time.

The face was never made by aliens. It was nothing more than a mesa or a land form. Also if anyone tries to say that aliens were the ones who made the Face on Mars, don't believe them. It was probably made by a comett or one of those storms that Mars has every now and then. ",3,1,0.8643665313720703

I had learned about ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" and now i have to interview with Mrs. Sally Backbone because she thinks the face was created by aliens when I beg to differ!

Ms. Breadwill here to do an interview with Mrs. Backbone, because she thinks ""Unmasking the Face in Mars"" was made by aliens. I've did some research and i have all the answers to your questions Mrs. Backbone. Let's Get Started! "" Few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact and i think they are right"" said Mrs. Backbone. "" Well your certainly not wrong Mrs. Backbone, but cheif Jim Garvin told us "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it, plus what about in the years of 1998 and 2001."" replied Ms. Breadwill. I immedeitly showed Mrs. Backbone the photos that were taken in the year of 1998 and in the year of 2001 and she was speechless.

Mrs. Backbone had another question for Ms. Breadwill (me). I told Mrs. Backbone to let all the questions she needed to answer be said. Mrs. Backbone told me that The Face on Mars was located at 48 degrees south martain latitude. Ms. Breadwill shook her head and replied "" Your wrong, because the scientists and I studied and found out that The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude."" Mrs. Backbone was once again speachless and i think i seen her roll her eyes. "" Mrs. Backbone how are you feeling?"" Ms. Breadwill commented. Mrs. Backbone simpliy sighed and said "" Can we move on to the last question?""

Mrs. Backbone had one more question, and i was hoping it wasn't too hard since I have been answering all her questions correctly. Mrs. Backbone said, "" the Face is not a natural landform and I still believe there is an alien monument. I sighed and told her she was wrong once again. She yelled "" How?!"" I simpliy told her On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

Ms. Breadwill told Mrs. Backbone one last thing and it was "" What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

NASA didn't know how to explain but with the explanation that it was a mesa or some other landfiorm on the surface. Is it or is it not? Many people think its aliens, but let's look at the big picture. There is pure evidence that what you're seeing is a landform and I have some examples.

After close survey of the "" face "" NASA has concluded that what we are seeing is a mesa. In the text it says, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa-landforms common in the American West."" That is proof that scientists who specialize in this wwork confirm that what we are looking at are just mesas or buttes.

But really if there was aliens on MArs then we would've seen some evidence by now. If aliens built this then why didn't we see any tracks or signs that the aliens built this thing. NASA has taken photographs of the moon and Mars many times. In those times if there was alien life then I would think that their would be some sort of sign that leads us to believe that we are not alone.

Everyone knows that the alien theory is just fun in games. People just let those kinds of pictures out mainly for the enjoyment of the people. In the text it says, "" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" That shows that NASA just released this photo so that the people would have some entertainment theorizing what this is.

Another big piece of evidence was shown in this story. In the text it says, "" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cyodnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Thats the sole cause. It was just a mesa that was photographed at the right time. If the shadows weren't there then it would just look like a regular mesa on Mar's surface. Also if you look in that picture you will see other mesas or landforms surrounding it. So that tells you that that area is full of landfroms.

In conclusion, there is so much evidence showing that this was just a landform. And if you still believe that thi is aliens then you need to look at the facts. Aliens might be real but we need to find evidence that they did this before we go and say that they did. Based on evidence we can conclude that this picture is of a mesa taken at the right time to where it looks like a face. ",4,1,0.8112967014312744

Many scientist thought it was the work of aliens but here are some facts to prove that this theory is incorrect. Through the process of movie films, books and other things people used to explain this phenonmean, and through scientifical evidence.

When the news spread about the strange human face on Mars, many people became interested in the fact that aliens could have been responsibel for this event. To surpise the face on Mars has become a popular icon, with many Hollywoodfilms, books, magazines, and even talk shows. This greatly increased the number people going with the idea that aliens could be the cause of this but this idea is false. In the atricle ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", it talks about on April 5,1998 that the Mars Global Surveyor was launched over Mars to check the so called alien monument. While using the Mars Orbiter Camera, Micheal Malin and his crew used his ten time sharp vision to scan the ""alien monument"" and found out it was just a natural lanform.

Even though the scince had proved that the strange face on Mars was just a landform, not alot of people were convinced. However, Science once agian came out to prove once and for all that it was indeed a landform. Using the camera again, Michael Malin and his crew caluclated the picture of the landform while using maximum resoltion and their result was amazing. The photo on Mars and a photo on earth had proved that the Mars face was just a butte or mesa landform. Infact, these are common in the American West!

There will always be arugements around the world, but these facts prove that the Mars Face is just a landform.

Once this was seen by alien theortists though, they really believe it was made by aliens, but here's my reasoning why they are wrong.

When the Face was first spotted by NASA's Viking 1 spaceship, in 1976, the scientists in the Jet Propulsion Lab were amazed by what they saw. Though it was only a little while when the scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, but the shadows around it gave it the illustion of a face. Once this was released to the public not my people believe it was a mesa. The alien theortists said, ""The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" Even when the defenders of NASA said, ""Wish there was an ancient civilzation on Mars."" This still did not make the alien theortists want back down.

Years later, in 1998, Michael Malin photographed the Face with his Mar Orbiter Camera. This picture was ten times sharper than the Viking photos years before. Soon thousands of people were waiting for the Face to appear, but when it did, it was shown to be a natural landform, no alien formation. Even when shown this, many alien theortists said that the clouds were blocking the alien markings.

In 2001, Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of the Face. There is no excuses on whether or not this is a mesa or an alien formation. The sky was clear, the picture was 1.56 meters per pixel, than the Viking fourty-three meters per pixel. There is not argument that this a natural landform. Even if there was something as big as the Egyptian pyramids or as small as a shack, you whould be able to tell what it was in a picture like this. After that picture was taken Jim Garvin said,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" also, he said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated measa about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.""

This is proof on whether or not the Face is a natural landform. After the first sighting in 1976 to the lastes picture taken in 2001, the Face on Mars is clearly a natural landform, not a alien formation. ",3,1,0.848463773727417

Martian mesa's are very common and can be found through out Mars. The only thing that helped it look like a face was, the shadows that the mesa made. The sun also cause the mesa to look like a face but when nasa took a closer and clearer photo of the mesa they found out it was just a simple rock formation that had very dark shadows making it to look like it had a nose, eyes, and mouth as the text states.

Have you heard about the Face on mars? Well if you haven't the Face is a picture Nasa took on Mars, this figure looks like a humans face. People agure that's possibly aliens did this, others agure that it's just part of the

I believe that the Face is just part of natural landform, because there is no proof that aliens are even real. in the article it says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing..... a natural lanmark.

Some people believe that the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on mars- evidence that Nasa would rather hide. I would say that there no reason why Nasa would lie and cover up the truth if something is living in Mars. If there were somthing that cause the Face, Nasa would of revealed it, because they would get more money. Once nasa went to take the picture again in April '98 it was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. Skeptics still didn't believe Nasa that the Face was just natural landform. They argured that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Although Nasa knows there is no proof that aliens excist so we can't predict that aliens have something to do with the Face. After all people have different opinion on this.

There will still be people who believe it just a natural landform and others that think it has to do something with aliens. I still agree with Nasa that the Face is just part of the land on Mars.

In the photo that was taken, a fairly large head-looking object that was nearly 2 miles long was on the Red Planet. This caused many people to believe; What if there's life on Mars? It seems like a head but i strongly believe it is just a natural landform.

Scientists have proved that the theories of the object being a sign of life was highly unlikely. However when it comes to consipiracy theories, people are very stubborn to believe them without any proof. The scientists figured that it was simply a mesa which is pretty common around there except according to the text, ""-this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Later, the image was unveiled and it certainly caught a lot of attention!

Since it caught a lot of people's attention, it soon starred in a Hollywood film, was in books, magzines, and radio talk shows according to the text. This would obviously cause more people to believe it is a sign of life on Mars, since it went so viral. But the thing is is that it is not evidence of life, yet so many say it is. It has not been scientifically proven. NASA themsleves have said that it is just a natural landform. Also, movies, magazines, and books overexaggerate things so they really aren't evidence.

I believe it is a landform just like any other. Here on Earth, we have plenty of landforms. According to the text, scientists have said that landforms are very common around there, specifically Martian mesas. Coincidentally, this landform just so happened to be shaped like a head. There are plenty of landforms and other objects that look like other objects. Here on earth we could have a rock shaped like a heart or a pond shaped like a nose.

I also believe that it is just the people's imagination that leads them to believe this. Sometimes our imaginations and theories can't always be correct. There are plenty of conspiracy theories out there. I believe that if you do not have solid evidence for such theories, don't believe them.

On April 5, 1998, the object was proven to be a natural landform which proved some scientists wrong about their theories about it being an alien monument. It was proven by the Mars Global Surveyor which flew over Cydonia to check on the unusual object. This proves that there is no life on Mars and that the ""face"" is just a natural landform.

I have a strong belief that the ""Face on Mars"" was a natural landform. I do not think that the face was created by aliens. It could be a possibility but there is no proof that would back up that statement. Although, the fact that that the face was a natural landform doesn't need much backup because it's something that naturally happens. The only difference is that it's not usually a face that is usually created.

How could aliens know what to make a face look like? And not just any face, a human face. As the caption noted, ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth."" I doubt that the aliens could make an exact replica of a human face because they have nothing to reference it off of.

Also, theres another question. How the face could have been made by aliens? What could the aliens possibly have made the face with? Im sure they would have required some tools to make this face on the planet of mars. Their hands would not be likely to complete that task because of what the planet is made of. The NASA didnt say they found any tools or objects that could be used as to make this ""face"".

Another doubt i have towards the aliens creating this face is what aliens? In the passage it said ""Manwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This implies that there is no civilization on Mars. So if there is no civilization on Mars, there is no one or nothing that could have made this face. How would they have made it if there is no one there to possibly make it?

There is reasoning I have to back up my opnion that it was a natural landform. Natural landforms happen here and there, almost everywhere. They come in any shapes and sizes. The form of a landform could be in any kind of shape. It's whatever it comes out to be. In this specific case though, the landform has captured the form of a face, somehow, with the correct facial features in the right places.

In the passage the ""Face of Mars"" is compared to the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" If there are other more specificly shaped landforms in the world, why cant it be one on mars? Theres no difference in the form that natural landforms come in. They all can come in any type of way. It doesn't make a difference where they're at or what they're made of. A natural landform is always going to be a natural landform.

In conclusion, I believe that the ""Face of Mars"" is a natural landform. There is no evidence disproving this statement. I do not believe that it was created by aliens. That was just an assumption that was made about the making of the ""face"".    ",4,1,0.8909918069839478

I asked her alot of time about why she thought that and you wanna know what she always said! She said ""isnt it obivious that no one else in on earth and so no one can make it"".

but not everyone was satisfied so they took another picture with MGS but it was not easy because It was hard to to find the exact position of it and they had to look throught wispy clouds.

they also took a 2nd photo which was extrodinary because they used the cameras maximum resoulution which would show anything such shacks pyramids or planes you could see what the were what the picture actually showed was butte or mesa landforms common around the american west.

0f789a2,"There are many controversial ideas about what was seen in the picture on Cydonia. Some belive it was from alien life form some do not. I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens. I say this because we have pictures proving so, landforms are known to form in odd ways, and we have double checked and there were no signs of alien life forms.

The ""Face"" was not created by aliens because we have pictures proving so. In the article ""Unmasking The Face Of Mars"" they said that when they first saw a picture of this mysterious face is was the year 1976. A lot of changes were being made that year, it was the peak of technology for Americans and we were bound to go on in our experiments. it states in the article that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photo."" And in return it was a natural landform. But people were still not satisfied. They claimed that the picture was taken at a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet so they tried again as stated in the passage, "" Nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"" and the results were as followed, "" Marlins team captured an extroardinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution"" the results still came back as a lanform.

I do not believe that the "" Face "" was created by aliens because landfroms are known to form in odd ways. For example in the article it states that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the american west."" They claimed this after taking the picture April 8, 2001. The picture simply shows ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" as said in the article. How many times when we were all children did we think we saw someone when it was just a shadow? plenty of times and in this instance it is exactly the same.

And lastly I do not believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was created by alien life form because we have double checked and checked again and we did not find signs of any form of life on Mars. It said in the article that they took a picture in 1976, then they were astonished so they checked again in 1998, and then when people were still not satisfied they checked agin in 2001. It sates in the article that ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""

and not only that but, "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.

However though, it states in the article that "" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars"" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that "" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that "" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the ""conspiracy theorists"" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.

To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars.

0f87684,"As of 1976, there has been ¨a photo from Viking 1¨ showing what appears to be face on Mars. This information came straight from NASA back when they first discovered the face. This is well related to the topic around aliens and alien theories. People have believed forever that aliens exist somewhere is the universe. Then recently becuase of the picture showing the face on Mars strengthening their beleifs. They have said, ""the Face is bonafide evidence of life on Mars.¨ Many people believe this face was a monument created by aliens so, here´s why they are wrong.

This photo was first taken sometime in 1976. It is a photo of small region of mars with a couple of formations. But one formation sticks out like a tall man in an elementary school. This picture was taken at the right angle at the right time. It makes it look a face with the angle and shadows. And many people believed it to be a monument made by extratellestular figures. Another reason why they believe for it to be made from aliens is because, ¨What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.¨

Their is a lot of people that would disagree with belief of this face being real. They would believe this way because they would it´s childish to believe that a rock formation on a foreign planet could ever possibly be made by aliens. Another reason why is because if it does resemble a earth-like formation that was not man made, that means the face was made by aliens, it was just an act of nature. It is physically challenging to make a formation, the shape of a human face, on a planet way far away from its neighboring planets.

People have also taken more recent pictures of the face. One in 1998 and another one in 2001. The newest one from 2001 is pretty old but gives the most recent information. It has the highest resolution of any picture of that face. In this picture, it is zoomed in more than the original photo and a lot more clear than the first one, their is a lot more detail. But in this photo, it doesn look like a human, it has more of a resemblance of a lion. But also, it looks to be more natural than before because the higher resolution and less blur.

Again, the people that have believed that the face wsa alien made rock formation were wrong. It is merely just a natural formation that has face-like features that was believed to be a face because of a shadow and a good camera angle. The so called ¨Face on Mars¨ is no longer real and was just a moment of glory for the people at NASA.",3,1,0.909072995185852
0fa92b4,"There are many things that people think the Face on mars is. You however, think that the face was created by aliens. We have gathered a lot of evidence on this and here is why you are wrong.

In paragraph 12 it says, ""What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" So if it really was an ancient alien artifact then that mean that aliens have been here as well. Along with all of the pictures we have aquired if there was a civilization we would have been able to see at least some of the remains in the pictures. But we have not.

Paragraph eight however, says, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Though this could be true, we have better quality pictures now than we did then and there are no alien markings shown. With the quality of the pictures we have now we can zoom in and it still looks fairly close to how it looks at normal size, and there are no markings.

In paragraph seven it tells us once more that, yet again, it is a natural landform. But people are not satisfied with that answer. In paragraph five conspiracy theorists say that it's bona fide, or evidence of life on Mars. They say that NASA would rather hide this information but people who work for NASA wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Would they seriously hide this kind of information from the public? No, because it would get them money and this would possibly be a world changing discovery.

So, in conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landmark. It has been proven that it is a landmark and nothing more several times. If you don't believe me then fine. But I really think you should just hang this one up for now.",4,1,0.891254723072052
0fc99a9,"Mesa, Not A Human

The face that was found on Mars is most likely just a regular landform that forms on rocky planets. I don't think it was created by aliens, and this is my reasoning for why I think this.

First, knowing that this face was made in the rocks of Mars, that is a clear exploit that it is a natural rocky landform. In the images of the face that the Viking 1 rover had taken on Mars in 2001, it turns out that it doesn't look like much of a head after all. In addition, the whole thing was purposely meant to attract the public and bring attention to Mars, and it did. Also, in April 5, 1998, scientists took pictures of the landform and even said that it was revealed that the Face was a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all.

Next, the rover had snapped a picture, but the scientists say that it had to look down through wispy clouds to see the Face. And it became a pop icon. It had appeared in books, movies, magazines, radio talk shows. The Face was just all talk. And according to the article, some think that this is bona fied evidence of life on Mars, but scientist have figured out it probably isn't. It was really another Martian mesa that were pretty common around Cydonia.

Some might say that this actually is evidence of life on Mars. And they might go deeper into the reseach themselves, and according to the article the shadows did make it look like an actual human face, however that is the thing. It was the shadows. The unusual shadows were what made it look like a face, specifically an Egyptian pharoah.

Therefore, the Face that was found on Mars wasn't a human head, but yet another Martian equivalent of a mesa or butte. And it was the same height as the the Middle Butte on Earth, So it must've been just a natural landform on Mars that formed and looked like a face. It was simply a deception and a coincidence.               ",3,1,0.9046443700790405

I believe that it is a natural landform because it is said that it looks like another landform on Earth. It is also shown on the pictures that NASA astronuats have taking that it is not alien made. The shadows have made the landforms craters look like facial features. There wasn't any proof of alien life on the face just theories made by consumers.

People who believe it was made by aliens say that for many reason. The first reason is that hte first picture showed what look like a face staring back at you. Sencond reason is because they believe that we are trying to hide something from them. Also people want something to believe even if it doesn't have any realistic evidence. Last but not least the theory that aliens are out there has been around for ages so it wouldn't be wrong for them to believe that aliens did it.

It may look that way in the past but only because the images we captured then were not as inhansed as the ones now. The first photograph, made from the Viking 1, may have give the illusion that it was a face. Now that our technology is now modified we can see that is was just a landform. It wasn't a face made by aliens.

Some might think one thing is special effects, others will think it is real. In Unmasking the Face on Mars, the author explains controversy of the ""face"" found on Mars' surface. It became an icon once it was released to the public. It was highlighted for decades and the society argued over it being an alien making, or just a land form called a mesa. The face was just a natural landform and it shouldn't have been thought as an alien form.

The most logical answer to this was that it was a mesa, and that the shadows on the surface happened to make it look like a human face of an egyptian pharaoh. This struck civilization in the late 70s and caused a lot of arguments. The people that thought is actually was an alien structure were just people of the press who just wanted attention. A Mars Global Surveyor "" snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared an a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quotes directly states and gives evidence that it is just a natural landform.

There isn't even any true or logical evidence that the face on Mars was an "" alien artifact."" It was just a rumor that went around to keep things interesting and intrigue big movie companies. The cameras even took a picture with a ten times better resolution than the 1976 picture of the face. In addition, the new picture even had each pixel in the image span 1.56 meters in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel. Garvin talks that "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" and that "" if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Garvin directly states here that no matter what, the formation couldn't have possibly been an alien formation or even a pyramid. This is even more proof that it is ridiculous to think that the formation was an "" alien making .""

Although the face was thought to be alien, there is too much evidence that denies it, and that it isn't. Scientists would wish that it was an extra terrestrial sign, but the odds of that are too scarce to even consider. This was a very controversial topic, as I have stated before. All of the theorists out there had many different and unique opinions of it. The narrator says what the image "" actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landfroms common around the American West. "" It remeinds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin."" This evidence gives even further support that it isn't extra terrestrial, and states that it isn't, shich exposes that it is a fluke.

The face on Mars was an ongoing argument for years to come once it was released to the public. There was no reason to do so. There was already valid points that gave proof of it being just a mesa. Things like this occurence happen all the time, even in your daily life. If things like this run across your mind, think about it the logical way and not a very, very unlikely path about it. There may be similarities between the sides, like in this argument. But, there was too much to show that it favored the more realistic side of it.

Landforms created from nature shouldn't be lied about just to get attention. That is why we don't tell other people a lie when it is just a landfrom like the Grand Canyon. Here are also reasons how I know it wasn't created by aliens.

Some rock formations on Earth are created by wind chipping off peices until one day the rocks are completely gone. We didn't have any control of the winds that created the rock formations, so that shows that nothing living created it. Around the face is other landforms that were created the same way the Face was made. The Face is the only one that people pay attention to becuase it looks like a face, but if you look at the entire picture you can see that other landforms are there that might not look like a face, but they show that landforms are created naturally there.

These examples show us that these landforms were not created by aliens, but by the weather that accurs there. That is why we shouldn't lie just to get attention and make everybody believe something that isn't real.

Many information from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" can help come to a conclusion. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.

The first supporting evidence to the claim is that the face would benefit NASA if the Face was made by aliens like people said. Real evidence of aliens would be an informational outbreak. NASA would be credited for an outstanding discovery, so why would they hide a true theory from arguing skeptics?

Second, several other natural landforms are just like the Face on Mars. The picture shows its reseblence to landforms common around western America. Mars Global Surveyor, Garvin, stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Also, The resemblence was ""formed by shadows giving the illusion of"" a face showing it is just a mesa.

Lastly, supporters of the alien theory believed the Face has alien markings that are hidden. They thought this because of wispy clouds in front of the camera taking the picture appeared.

The thing about someone putting something on the earth is you could tell that someone or something put it there Im going to be presuading you that the face on the land is just a naturl land formation and has not been put there by a living creture such as an alien.

The face that has formed on the earth over the years is just a natural land form. I think it is just a natural landform because you can see in the pictures up above how it changes of the year. The face changes of the years because the way the land movement is. You can see that it has not been put there by somone because the way it has changed over the years that it has formed.

The reason I think it has formed over the years is because if you look at the pictures look how much the formation from 1998 to 2001. If it was put there by someone, it would of been alot more clear that a someone made the face. The face appeared because of how the land moves.

Carving a giant face has got to be one of if not thee least effective way of dong so.

These ""aliens"" very well could have simply just put a peice of shiney metal on the surface and the MGS would have seen it and we would probaly think ""hey, this unknown element is here on the surface of a planet where there are no metals"". Not only would it make us think that there is indeed metals on Mars but then we would think ""hey metals most usually form deep undergroud so there is no reason for this to be on the surface"". THAT would be a valid way of letting us know ""hey, we exist"".

Also another thing, if ""aliens"" made ""the Face"" how is it no footprint s were found. And there's no wind on Mars they coulnt have blown away.

10aea63,"So, you think that this face on mars, was made by an Alien? Well you thought wrong. There are many reasons why this was not made by an alien. It could be the formation of the land on mars or spacerocks hit it, or it could even be something from inside mars. You dont always know. But Im going to explain why.

Scientist have already went up and discovered this face on Mars because at one time, a lot of people though it was a face made by aliens. Everyone was so excited to see pictures and everything. But some of the information in this article thinks otherwise. In paragraph 7 in this article, it explains how Michael Malin, flew over mars and captured sharper pictures of this ""face. "" But it soon revealed that it was not made by Aliens, it was just a natural lanform and there was no Alien Monuments.

A lot of people were dissapointed, but like I said anything could of happend. The people from NASA took a bunch of pictures and did a lot of tests on it and the picture pretty much said the same thing all along. Plus, Aliens were alive 1000 years ago, if that and so why would people think that they would choose mars, out of all the other planets, and burry an alien in Mars, and it all the sudden show back up. Now do you really think this is true? Now I think it is just a formation in land like the article said.

In the article, some people think that the Alien markings were hidden by haze. Thats a logical reason but I still dont think it is realistic enough. If the haze did not show up in the picture that they took, how could they of not saw it. Plus the Article says that the picture that was most recently took, the lenses on the camera was 10 times sharper and better than the photos that the Vikings photo.

Near the end of the Article it talks about how they even went back again that was even better than the 2 pictures before and that zoomed in so you could see every little detail. Then again it came back with the same results. It was a land formation. They think that it was just a lava dome and has the same formation.

So with all of fthat information I think it is pretty reasonable to say that there was no Aliens on Mars and there deffinataly is not a face from them. This could happen on any other planet to. All along it was just a land formation. At the beggining of the Article I also thought that it was a face from the Aliens too but then I went through the article and there is no possible way. Land forms on its own. So with that being said I guess mars formed with a face on it. Plus rocks and stuff could of made the indents in the face to make it look like eyes.

I hope that was a agreeable argument that aliens were never on mars and proably will never be again.  ",4,1,0.8716808557510376

Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, ""Bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa. I agree with Garvin that this landmass was not an alien or proof of aliens whatsoever.

There is a large amount of proof in the article that was confirmed by NASA that this face is only a landmass, nothing more. In paragraph two of the article the author claimed that mesa's were ordinary in Cydonia, area the mesa was located, according to scientists. The only difference between this mesa and other mesa's found on Mars is that it had uncommon shadows over it illustrating eyes and a mouth. Since mesa's are common in this area it is very unlikely that this, ""face,"" was anything different than just an average mesa taken at an odd angle with a low quality camera.

The author also stated in paragraph seven that in 1998 that the photo was retaken with a higher quality camera. NASA released the photo onto a JPL website once the photo was confirmed and the only thing found was not an alien monument, but a natural landform. Many people still doubted that it was a mesa after this photo due to wispy clouds bluring the picture of the monument. According to paragraph ten in the article, the picture was taken one last time of the landmass revealing the same thing, an average mesa.

Mesa's also are found commonly in the american west as said in paragraph eleven. The mesa resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. The two mesa's share a similiar height, appearence, and were not alien monuments. People argue that the mesa in Ohio doesn't have a face appearing on the top, but the only reason the mesa on Mars has a face is due to the angle at which the picture was taken as I said earlier in my piece.

The two oppsing sides in this argument have evidence to argue their opinion. The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars.",4,1,0.816321611404419
10ebd3c,"At a glace, ""The Face of Mars"" could be misunderstood as an alien artifact. The Scientists at NASA are more than sure it is nothing but a rock formation, an illusion caused by the the shadows it causes. The picture still bacame an icon over its false label however. For two and a half decades, people believed there were aliens outside of the atmosphere placing these on planets. It wasn't until a more clear camera came around that

the face really was shown.

To the dismay of many conspiracy theorists, the face is nothing more than a mesa. As Jim Gavin, cheief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program calls it reminds him most of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Not only are these rock formations common on Mars barren landscape, but also the living, breathing planet that is our home. Mesas are highly common on earth-this one on Mars just so happens to look like the face of a person.With all of the media attention it recieved, the article even says ""defenders of the NASA budgetwish there was an ancient civilation on Mars."" We can infer that NASA's findings were not that of aliens, as though they currently do not have the funds for space exploration projects,

With people unsatisfied of NASA saying it was just an odd formation of rocks, NASA took pictures of it on April 5, 1998, and again on April 8, 2001. As the images becaome sharper and shaper over time, it looks less and less like a human head. With the better pixels, people could see that it was just as NASA made it out to be- a mesa. With this picture, many theories around the face were not as credible.

Some might say that it still might be from an alien. even so, it seems like something you would see on our world that scientists could prove naturally. The rock formation being common on Earth, and multiple pictures across 25 years is sufficent enough to be proven false.NASA also mentions that the main reaon for the rocks looking as they are are from the strange shadows over it, giving the illusion of a face. The main reason for all the attention it got was simply because ofa trick of the eye. NASA also includes that clouds on the surface could be another reaon it looks as such.

Keeping these things in mind, it's safe to say that the face people see is just a natural part of Mars. The same natural formation can be found around our world .The reason people believed it to be something more was because a poor quality camera by today's standards. Since the, we can better understand how it looks. What would it look like with a camera today? ",4,1,0.8865978717803955
10efec8,"In 1976 NASA'S Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor had taken a picture of a face-like form on Mars.

The area that this was found in is common for having these types of forms.

This land form was found in Cydonia, a region on Mars.

This form on Mars is a natural land form, although many people thought it to be created by aliens.

This thought had sparked sudden interest into the people about Mars, when it was released to the public.

Scientists had further looked into it and found it was just a land form.

However, somone had still thought that this was created by extra terestrials because they knew it was winter in Cydonia, so it was cloudy.

They stated that they thought the clouds could have blocked off many features of this land form.

They also thought that if you had taken a clearer picture then you would see many other features explaining that another life form had created it.

The same picture was later on taken in 2001.

This picture had many more pixels to show an HD picture of the object.

This updated picture showed a much more smooth and almost dome-like formation instead of a face.

This led many scientists to believe that this is a natural land form.

Some of the rock's features still had resembled a little bit of a human face.

Before NASA could know for sure wether this was natural or not they made the face on Mars a priority to take more pictures and find where it is and when they did, they had found that yes, it was just simply a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA had seen a face on Mars and couldn't figure out what it was so they took more pictures as the technology advanced.

This allowed scientists to know for sure that this was a natural thing.

Many people are still convinced that this is an extra teresrial creation and thet Ancient Eqypt had truely been crated by these creatures considering the fact that this face looks like and ancient pharoa from around those exact times.",3,1,0.8557279109954834

The landform is a Martian mesa or butte that is common around the planet Cydonia. The shadows formed around the mesa makes it appear as if it's actually a real life Egyptian head.

Judging by the ways the conspiacy theorists said it might be an evidence that life exists on Mars, and saying NASA is hiding it is just wrong. The theorists still don't have enough evidence to prove it is a real life face, and that it was created by aliens. NASA actually does research, not them (using fake facts), and that NASA would never do such a thing.

Yes, the face did appear on television, books, magazines, a movie, and haunted a checkout line for 25 years, but this doesn't mean it is a real face. The later photos (1998, 2001) would look different than the 1976 one because it (the mesa) changed too much, and that it was revealed in a JPL web site in 1998 that it was indeed a natural landform, and it reminded fellow Chief Scientist Jim Garvin of a natural butte that takes the shape of a lava dome in the Snake River Plain in Idaho.

Scientist had took more pictures to get more information and they discovered that their photo had looked exacally like the vikings photo they took in 1976 so that gave scientist ideas of what they had on their hands. Scientist also thought that the photo was Martian Equvalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. Garvin stated that the lava dome takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face as on mars thiis statement gives second thoughts of what scientist discovered.

People think that aliens made it but the people at NASA wasnt trying to find aliens and they didnt. the face in mars was just a common mesa that is found in that region. the first thing that seen it was viking 1 it was trying to find a landing place for its sister ship viking 2. People only think it was a face because the tech wasnt atvanced enough to see the image clearly.

Some people think that it looked like a Egyptian pharaoh. The face on mars was in some movies,magizins,and on the radio.Some conspiracy theorists think that NASA found aliens and are hiding it from the public. More than one spacecraft was sent to take pictures of the land formation.

When they sent space crafts up there the land formation was hidden by clouds. That made people go crazy they started to make storys about the clouds. The space crafts where built to only take pictures of a cople meters so it took them a long time to get the pictures. Finally they put it to rest when the last ship went up there to get pictures and they did that showed a rock formation.

Therefore, many people where fighting about who was right about the mesa. Some people was arguing with NASA. NASA said that the have no busniess finding aliens. People think that they are lying about the whole thing while others think that it is all true what they are saying.They had to prove that it wasnt true so they kept taking picures untill they had a clear picure and they relesed it to the world.",2,1,0.866915225982666

The reason I came up with for the reason it looks like a face is when mars plates move and the earthquake happened, some of the ground raised higher than others. I also have other reasons a meitorite might have hit mars and and when the meitorite hit little bits of rocks fell in the dirt to make that face shape.

These are some little guesses I have about the reason mars has that face shape on its planet. I say this because I have never seen a aliens before except when I was watching tv or a movie. So thats why I think it is a nautral landform.",1,1,0.7787762880325317
1174cd2,"Twenty-five years ago, a strange image was projected onto the monitors of mission controllers while the Viking 1 was taking photos of possible landing places for its sister ship, Viking 2. What looked like an alien's face had appeared! Mission controllers back at NASA must have been surprised to see this, but scientists were quick to say that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows to make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

As soon as the pictures were released, there were mixed reactions. Some agreed with the scientists and their research saying that the rock formation was just a common mesa, but some were skeptical. Conspiracy theorists believed that this rock was actually an artifact, saying that NASA was hiding extra infromation about this formation and comparing it to a common mesa.

The 1976 Viking 1 photograph does make it resemble a face, but later pictures denote this evidence. In 1998, the shadows are still visible, but there is no concrete proof that this is an alien artifact. The 2001 photo (taken with a camera of a greater resolution than the 1976 and 1998 photos) further proves my point. In the 2001 photo, you can faintly see the shadows of the face, but they are almost nonexistent.

In conclusion, scientists research proves that this is merely a rock formation. The 1976 photo could only prove that the formation exists, and the shadows could be because of bad quality cameras or just a luck of how the lighting was when the photo was taken. The later photos are more accurate because of our increase in technology, therefore being our number one source for finding out the truth. Aliens do not exist, as far as we know, and scientists continue to prove that theory with updated technology.",3,1,0.779800534248352
1188040,"As exciting as alien formations on Mars would be, claiming the Face is of extraterestrial origin is like stating Old Faithful was dug by cavemen.

Nature can take a plethora of exotic forms.

We know this from exploring the many natural wonders of our own world, Earth.

That is why we can't jump to an irrational conclusion when faced with an irregular occurance.

You see, from a non-subjective view point, there is no face at all.

There is an area in your brain dedicated to breaking down the world around you and associating it with familiar objects and patterns.

This is why you may see a rabbit amoungst the clouds or a butterfly in an ink-blot test.

When it came to a low-resolution image of Martian rock formation with conveniently placed shadows, it only took a fraction of a second for our brains to automatically associate its appearance with something humans see everyday; a face.

In reality, there's no more of a face in the Face than there is an angel in an abstract painting.

Furthermore, evidence from NASA's most recent expodition has highlighted the Martian formation for what it truly is.

Compliments of rapidly evolving technology, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) sent in 2001 captured a brilliant, high-quality image of the Face.

With the camera's 1.56 meter per pixel resolution, it greatly shed a more vivid light on the planet in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel camera used by the Viking 1 in 1976.

Now the formation could be identified as a natural butte or mesa on Mars.

It is very similiar to the rock formations one would find in western regions of the United States.

Since we know such rock forms are created by natural processes such as erosion, the theories of aliens can be firmly put to rest.

I will not completely disperse the possibility of foreign life forms outside of Earth; however, the Face is definitely not a product of an ancient civilization. As new data is gathered about the Red Planet, more anomilies will inevitably arise.

Curiousity is the essance of human nature, so we will undoubtly explore each mystery and may yet come across new signs of life.

Despite being just a rock, the Face had positive effects in sparking the public's interest in Mars. Perhaps one day very soon we'll have humans walking amoung the planet's rust-colored surface, trekking into the unknown.           ",4,1,0.8697682023048401

To begin, the landforms you see everyday are just like the""Face on Mars"".

NASA believes, that this so called alien made feature is really just a natural landform.

This landform that is talked about is a lava dome which is in the form of a isolated mesa.

There were many photos taken of Mars. Many of those photos showed this feature. When the first picture was taken, it was very hard to see it it was natural or created by aliens. When they got more advanced photos it became clear that it was not an alien created landform and was really a natural landform.""When the image apeared on the JPL web site reaveling ... a natural landform.""

That is only true because even magazines,books,radio talk shows, tell lies just to get you to read them and buy them so they can make money.

The face on Mars is a natural land form that is just rocks and the shadows that made it look like a face. The way the rocks were fromed they made it look like a face when it really was not. The shadows from the planet also played a part in the story. It gave an illusion that the eyes, nose, and mouth peolpe just wanted to make a big deal of nothing.

The way the people tried to make it bigger than what it is that makes people more hype and they are going to think that it life on Mars. There is nothing on Mars like an other life froms.

The most common opinion was that the rock formation was created by aliens and there is human life on Mars. As a scientist at NASA, I can clearly state why this mysterious rock formation was not created by aliens.

From far away, the rock formation does appear to resemble a human face. To further examine, on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cyondia, the area where the rock formation is found, and Michael Malin took a picture that was ten times sharper than before. The image was released and revealed to be a natural landform. However, on that day the camera had to look through thin clouds to capture the picture, so come skeptics were content with the theory that some of the alien markings could of been hidden. A cloudless day came on April 8, 2001, so the Mars Global Surveyor took the chance to get another look. The camera's maximum resolution was used to capture the photo. Since the photo was closely zoomed in, it would of been possible to see what was on the ground near by. Since nothing was found on the ground nearby, it doesn't support the conspiracy theorists who claimed that NASA was trying to hide alien life. The picture shows that it is like a mesa or butte, a landform that can be commonly found in West America. To further help people understand, Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mar's Exploration Program, describes the land form as ""It reminds me of most Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain Idaho.That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" There very well could still be life on Mars, but unfortunately it has not been found with this information.

All in all, the face on Mars is simply just a landform that is similar to some landform's on Earth. It is understandable how people could think it is an Egyptian Paraoh because of the unusual shadows;however, closer up images reveal a mesa.

The face on Mars was really not a face on mars. Some people say it is a face but I believe it is just a formation on the planet. They have taken 3 pictures and 2 of them prove it is a mesa on Mars. The proof of that is that they have taken pictures in 1998,2001, and have compared it to a landform in the USA. People who believe it is created by aliens suely hasn't seen all the evidence behind ""The Face.""

First of all, when people saw the face in 1976 they couldnt have had o believe an aliens as making it. How could have there have been a person on Cydonia or an alien. That is why they went back to Mars to prove some scientists' theories wrong. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor had flew over Cydonia for the first time. The surveyor had a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Some people were not satisfied because it was cloudy on the Red Planet. They said that the alien marking were hidden by blaze. Compaing the picture of 1998, it certailey looks more like a regular rock on a surface. They went back four years later on a less cloudy day to still prove the believers wrong.

On a cloudless day the Mars Global Surveyor took away a piece of evidence of aliens in space. On April 8, 2001, four years later than the last visit to Cydonia, the surveyor captured the photo much better than all pictures and proved tha the face was a natural platform. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in he best 1976 Viking photo. The photos were astonishing and made the face be un masked.

People ask me how i know that I am correct,and to answer that question I say that I know what it is. NASA has not been hiding top secret information from anyone, and we are very puublic about what it is. It is a mesa, young people. They are common landforms, that they even occur on Earth. They are found in America, to the west of the country.

I wanted to know if anyone had any mor ewuestions for me. People emailed me questions from all ver the country, and other countries as well. A middle aged man wrote me from Texas last week, asking if i had ever seen some of the landforms, like a mesa or butte. The answer is yes, during the summer about 5 years ago, everyone on this case took a trip there to observe, and take notes what mechanisms lived there. A teenager from California asked if i have ever had any kind of suspicians about matrians creating the face. Like always I said no, because while there is plenty of data to support a mesa, there is almost no actual scientific proof of anyone seeing a martian.

Science changes over periods of time as technology and people progress. I feel that we will keep doing research over this face, but that won't change. Out of the all of the years that I have been trying to work with my team and put the peices together over and over again to make sure that we are right, I can't see any data changing. So do not be another guilable human who listens to tabloids and false internet articles and rumors. Listen to the facts of NASA scientists, you can trust us.   ",3,1,0.7483667731285095
126046a,"Was the Face on Mars created by aliens?

Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens? I don't... and that's because it's to many reasons that prove it's not. I'm a scientist at NASA and I helped prove these reasons. We found that it is just a butte or a mesa, aliens are not even real, and there is no life on Mars.

It has been proven that it is just a butte or a mesa, this is what the picture actually shows....landforms. A friend my mine, Garvin says that is reminds him of ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" that's here on Earth. So that states that we have the resources to prove it is a mesa!

It has been proven aliens are not even real. I mean people ""say"" they have seen one and even took pictures of them, but that doesn't mean they are real. We have not yet seen or even captured one for testing yet which proves that they are not real. This person who tells me that they ""think"" aliens created this face doen't even know if it's true. Therefore this is just a thought that is not true.

On another note there is no life on Mars, as proven by us (NASA). We have tested for air and a way we could live there without holding a oxegen tank around and there is no way. People think we are hiding if there is any life on Mars and if the face was created by aliens, but why would we let the World know that we were even researching about life on Mars or that we even found a face on Mars if we didn't want the World to know? Yes, we've done research over and over again to prove to the World that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a mesa, so we ask that the World believes us and keep the peace.

I have given my reasons why aliens did not create this face on Mars, and you may or may not agree, just please I ask you to keep the peace.            ",3,1,0.8545798063278198
127e739,"""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is an article about a natural landform on Mars that some people believe to be created by aliens. The Face has been scientifically proven to just be a landform called a butte or mesa. According to the article, some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, which is evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. I think this is illogical because in the article it states that defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. I am here today to support the idea that the Face is just a natural landform.

One fact to support the claim that the Face is just a natural landform is in the article. In the article it says that some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars that NASA is just trying to hide. If this were true why would defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars? They would not! That is why I believe the idea of the life on Mars to be illogical.

A second fact to support the claim that the Face is just a natural landform is in the article too. In the article it says that the first picture of the Face was taken in 1976, back when photo quality was not so exceptional. In the 1976 picture of the Face, I understand that it does look like a face, but in the 1998 picture the quality has became a lot better and it does not look as much like a face. Then again in 2001, there was another picture taken of the Face. In the 2001 picture of the Face, the quality has again risen and distinctively shows that the landform does not look like a face and is just a butte or mesa.

A third fact to support the claim that the Face is just a natural landform is again, in the article. In the article it says that the Face has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! I think this is why many people believe in all sorts of different conspiracies, because there all kinds of different books and more written about different beliefs. Today, people believe anything they read in a book or see on tv, that is also why I believe this. Who would you rather believe, books, stuff on tv, and other things, or scientifically proven facts?

In my opinion, it does not matter what you believe, but I support the truth. I would rather believe in the science, not people's opinions. Would you? If you want to be the logical person, you would be able to comprehend that the Face is just a natural landform. Scientifically proven information or opinions, pick your side.",4,1,0.8652033805847168
12a1427,"That photo is not an alien. What photo am I talking about? The photo the NASA took of the ""face""that is shown in a lot of places. In the arcticle its says,""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not. It is not an alien because it is just a natural land form, it is hard to target(because it never moves, small and blends in with all the rest of noraml mars), and people say it looks like a normal natural lava dome (and it does).

It is just a natural land from. It is only shaped like a face. There is nothing odd or strang about it besides the shaping. It just happened to look like a face. In the texts it says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows it had nothing to so with aliens, it was just a land form.

If it was a living thing, or used to be living shouldn't move around?Its not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. This shows it is one spot and small. It also proves it blends in like in other natural land form would do. If it was something special you would think it would be easier to find. If you don't look very closly you don't even see the face at all.

Not only is it natural land, but it is also reminds Garvin of a lava dome of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This again proves if you ignore the fact that it looks like a face, it looks completely normal. It looks like a normal thing any planet would have, even earth.

Some may agrue it looks to much like a face to not be something like an alien. Even though it is funny how much it looks like face, there are too many facts proving it isn't anything different from everything else on the planet mars. It just happened to be the way it formed it looked like a face.

There are many things proving, this thing on Mars is not an alien or created by aliens. First, it is just like anyother land form, just a ""werid"" shaping. Second, it blends in, is small and doesn't move. (This makes it hard to target.) Finally, it reminds people of a lava dome, again showing it is just shaped weird to us. The face got the attention of the public for a while, like the text said,""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" But, everyone needs to let it go because it is nothing to talk about since we now know the truth. It was fun for a while, but if you still believe it more than a normal part of mar's natural land, you will look like a fool. I guess we will have to keep looking on other planents to find live or ""aliens"" because so far it is for sure not on mars!",5,1,0.8321853876113892
12a7aff,"The Face was not created by aliens because there is no evidence on The Face to be able to test to see if it was created from an alien. We have searched The Face to find out to see if The Face was made by aliens, and the face was not crafted from aliens because we have not seen a single artifact, text, and/or any symbols near this landscape.

Since we have not seen an artifact in the landscape we could tell that there were no aliens near this area. Since we have not seen an artifact, yes, they could have maybe known that they dropped it and culd have gone searching for it, but then what about the other aliens they could have dropped any crafting utensils at the sight.

Now if there were any text in english then the text could have been from a fellow american space travelar, now if it was made by an alien the text wouldn't be in english, but there is no text in the sight because we haven't seen any so therefore it was not made from an alien, now if it were to be made from an alien they would have text or symbols on The Face because they wouldn't just leave it like that and then walk away. They would have put text or symbols.

Talking about symbols there are zero amount of symbols on that artifact because like I said earlier they would have put text or symbols on the artifact, but there are none of those things.

This shows how there was no chance of The Face showing that there were aliens building it. ",3,1,0.6299969553947449
12ad17a,"Many people think that the ""Face"" is actually the work of an ancient civilization that used to, or still might, live on Mars. Those people are proven wrong in many ways. I believe that the Face is not a Martian creation because if NASA knew about it, they would tell people so that they would get more publicity and make more money.

Also, after a higher resolution picture was taken of the face, it was clear that there was no sign of equipment near the face to build it. Lastly, Jim Garvin, who is a Mars expert, said, after long research, that the Face is just a landform.

The first reason people should be able to tell that the Face is not a Martian creation is that NASA would tell people about the chance of Alien life on Mars. That fantasy has been around for hundreds of years! Books and movies have stories of Aliens from Mars. There would be many more sales for NASA. Therefore, it is obvious that NASA would tell the public if there really was a chance of Martian excistence.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a photograph of the Head that was tens times sharperthan the first picture taken by the Viking. Many anxious web surfers where waiting for the image to appear on the JPL web site. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no sign of aliens at all. Concluding the reason as to why the Face is just a coax.

The third and final reason as to why the Face is fraud is that scientist Jim Garvin said that the Face is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which means landforms common around the American West. He said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face which appears on The Red Planet.

Now many people may argue that the picture was taken when it a cloudy time of the year in Mars - the picture may not have been able to see everything around the face. But, according to Garvin, you can discern things in a digital picture three times bigger than the pixel size so if there even were objets in the picture that showed any sign of excistence, you would be able to see them. Therefore there is no possoble way of a human or Martian building the Face.

So, the many people in the world that believe that the Face on Mars is actually a creation of living beings, they are proven wrong. Multiple reasons point to the Face just being a landform that just so happens to be in the shape of a face. Not only would it take forever to make a face that is two miles long, it would also take supplies - which were not found. Furthermore, the Face on Mars is not a Martian creation.

12bbf33,"NASA discouvered a weard landform on Mars that lookes like a face. Some scientest, and people think that it is a sign of life or aliens. Most scientist think that it is a landform not aliens. I allso think that it is just a landform because Scientist have found simmilar landforms on Earth.

JPL Web site revealed to the public that it was a natural landform. The landform had nothing to do with aliens or life. But not everyone was satisfied. The face was located 41 degreas north martain latitude where it was winter in April 98 a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet.

The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, aliean markings were hidden by haze. Mission controllers looked again, Mars Global Surveyor is a maping spacecraft That normaly looks straight down and scans the planet.

Like a fax machine in narow 2.5 km wide strips They dont know if it pasced over the face very often. Sur veyors then got another pictuer using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

They discrern things in digital image 3 times bigger than pixel scize. So if ther were objects in this picture like airplans on the ground or shacks you could see what they were.

12ea160,"The face on Mars is definetly just a natural landform. There are many reasons for why the Face on Mars is thought to be the work of and alien civilization, but all of that is just fake. The first photo evidence of the face was back in 1976, when the picture quality was not as good as it is today, so it really looked like a face. The next photo evidence was taken in 1998, and the landform still resembled a face and there was controversey on whether or not the face was a work of aliens or not. On the day that NASA decided to get a picture of the mesa, it was a foggy day in Cydonia, so the camera could not capture the full quality of the landform. The decider of the photo evidence was in 2001. NASA decided to take this photo on a summer day in Cydonia and it was clear outside. Jim Garvin said that is was extremely difficult for them to pinpoint exactly where the face was in Cydonia. Garvin noted that they do not pass the face very often when they are not trying to get pictures of it. NASA also used the MGS on its maximum resolution. With the resolution, the scientists would have easily been able to see if there were any signs of alien life in the region of Cydonia.

The scientists concluded was that the ""face"" was actually just a mesa, which was like a common landform in the American West. Jim Garvin said that it was just a lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists say that NASA is just hiding the real evidence that they found. The defenders of NASA budget wish they found evidence of an ancient alien civilization, if they did, it would greatly benefit them.

The theory that there was an ancient alien civilization in the region of Cydonia on the planet Mars lasted for 25 years. The face appeared in a movie, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and it even appeared in checkout lines of grocery stores. This theory was finally proven incorrect after years of intense studies done at NASA, and they proved that the ""Face on Mars"" was indeed, just a natural land form on the mysterious planet of Mars.

Adrian scoffs and chuckles saying, ""I know a face when i see one, especially if it is up on Mars because none of our astronauts could have been able to make something like that and for what?"" - he pauses then continues, ""Of course it had to be aliens!""

Keilah starts to explain, ""First, us scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. You know something common enough around the Planet Cydonia only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" As Adrian jumps right back in almost as he wanted to interrupt her but had waited, he gives his own reasons. He says excitedly, "" Yeah but, after that a few days later we (NASA) unveiled the image with a caption saying that there was a huge rock form which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Right after noticing all the features I had to believe it was real! Not only that, but that aliens had put it all together! KEILAH, DONT' YOU SEE IT?""

""No I do not Adrian. I see the facts and what the picture actually shows. It's clearly the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- LANDFORMS COMMON AROUND THE AMERICAN WEST! hmm I seem to agree with 'Gavin' when he stated that it had reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Also when Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos it revealed a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all.

1379de4,"Would you beleve there are faces on Mars mad of rocks or made by some living creature? Some would think the NASA's photos of the face is made by living creatures. The photo first came about from the viking1 from 1976.

NASA has always had weird and unusal thing come from photos.

But in 1976 the Viking 1 undescoverd a face on Mars Viking 1 was snaping landing sites for its sister ship. When it took a photo of a mound that looked like a face. A few days later they put the photo out in public and they went crazy.

The MArs Global Surveyor in later years proved that it was just shoadows on a mound with a better camera it showed mor detail that it was just a mound of rock. There are people who still thing it is aleins. Even if there were objects with the camera you could see shack youcould see everything.

What the photo really shows is a bette or mesa landforms its a lava dome that takes the form of aan isolated mesa. these are common in the American West.

The ""faces"" are just showdows on a lava dome. The faces are just shadows on the lava dome. With the high reasolouton camera we proved that.   ",2,1,0.8732171058654785
138da74,"These photo's that were taken by NASA are rock formations. These photos were taken in 1976, 1998, and in 2001. People thought that the formations were from other living things that are on Mars. Nasa took several pictures of these rock formations because they were shaped like humans. The rock formations starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even ended up in haunted grocery store checkot lines for 25 years.

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. After taking several more photographs of these landforms people started to realize that they were natural landforms and not made by other living things.

NASA put the photots on JPL web sites so that people could see these pictures up close. Few cientisct thought that these artifacts were made by aliens. When NASA first took a picture of these faces they said that the face was staring back at the camera. They looked like Egyptian Pharaoh's.

There was no alien monument after all. The pictures actually show a butte or a mesa landforms comman aroiund the American West. These are natural landforms becuase scientitst say that there is no life on Mars. NASA took pictures in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. If there were objects in the pictures like an airplane on the ground or an Egyptain style pyramid or even a small shak you could see what they were.    ",2,1,0.8088711500167847
13a7cb9,"The Face of Mars was a historic discovery, and not because it was a new kind of land form. When the photo was first released, many thought it was an alien structure and that it proved there once was life on Mars. NASA then worked harder to understand the strange picture and to change the opinion of skeptics who tried to make it an ancient temple.

The first photo that was released was a low quality picture and the strange shadows gave it the look of a face. NASA began to obsess about the face and they began to get better and better resolution photos. It became more apparent that the face was just a mesa, which were common in the area. Skeptics insisted that NASA proves that is just a hill and NASA continued finding out more about the mesa. as the resolution improved, nearly all second-guessers were silenced. This happened because scientists were convinced that this landform was much like the Middle Butte in Idaho, which was most definately not made by aliens.

The Face did change how some people looked at the possibility of life on Mars. After the initial controversy, it was likely that the ""alien"" building was just a hill. Some still are skeptical even with the overwelming evidence, but they are also drowned out by those who know it was just an optical illusion. NASA proved that if there was ever life on Mars, it did not make the Face.   ",3,1,0.8904722929000854
13b6591,"I would know if it was real or not if only i had seen it with my own eyes but, im against the fact that they're saying that it's a real face made by the aliens because nobody would really think that there are aliens living in space. I also would know that it's not a face of the pharoah because the text says that it's a ""huge rock formation"". Nobody would really think that aliens created a face that big, even if there were aliens living in space i would not think that those type of creatures have any clue of how to build big structure like that. Only if i were out there in space looking at the face then i would know my self that it's real or not. A humans eye could tell if anything is real or not. If the world had something to prove that it's not a face then i would be with them and i would agree to everything they say about it, cause the person who thought that it was a face built by the aliens then i bet the majority of the peoples would disagree. All im trying to say is that i dont't believe that the aliens would build a face like structure. ",2,1,0.7339733839035034
13f81b1,"The Face on Mars was not made by aliens because, Earth has land formations as well that have unusual forms because of the way our techtonic plates move. Also if there are any aliens on the planet that could have made the Face form on the planet don't you think they would still be there after all they made the Face form there so they should have been able to survive on the planet. The strange land form, commenly remind people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho because it have the same height of the Face on Mars. Plus, if it were made by aliens we wouldn't have found out about it NASA is really good at hiding things from us because they work for the government. Plus it is scientifically proven that nothng can survive in space because of the lack of oxygen and the coldness in space. Scientist have also found out that some planets have many features of the Earths inner layers, Plus in space there are many things such as metiorites thst could have hit the planet mars and amde that strange land form.

1423619,"The face on the plante of Mars was not created by aliens. Scientist have been studying this object for many years and with the new high-tech cameras and the new gear they have they are able to look at the picture very much more clear. The scientist have been studying and have recently just found out that it was just to be a mesa. The mesa is very common in Cydonia as it states in the article. It would make a tlot of sense if it would just be found out that it actually was.

The huge face was studied by Jim Garvin. He traveled to Cydoia to take a look at the face for his self. When he arrived by the huge mesa he took a very good picture to prove it was only a mesa and nothing more. Many people were not happy when they found out what Jim had to say. They were making statements that it was a winter day in that part of ""The Red Planet"" so it was very cloudy and so he probably just didn't see any of the symbols or signs that the aliens must have made.

The surveyor then went to Mars again in 2001 when it was all summer time by the huge mesa and he then took another photo. "" The photo was an extraordinary photo that was taken."" says Garvin himself. They eventually found out that it actually wasn't anything that the aliens have made but only a mesa.

Many other people or scientist might say that it is part of alien life because of where it was placed and how it actually looks. People say it is a sign from the aliens or martians. It is impossible for it to be from the aliens because it has been studied for years and years and photos have been taken multiple times to show that it was nothing more than only a mesa.

Aliens don't have the knowledge to know how to make a human face because they have never seen one before. How would an alien or a martian know what a human face looks like. They don't lnow so it couldn't have been from any alien activity

My ruling stands in what in know about the mesa that was found on Mars. People cant argue because it was scientifically proven that it is not a face on the face of the planet it is only a mesa. The mesa on the planet is only a natural landform that happens to look like a face. Nothing more and nothing less.",4,1,0.837796688079834
143fb6e,"The face is fake. there is a lot of evadence that the face is fake. for one,in all three pictures it looks different. also the"" face"" it not even simular to a face. it also says that the camra had to look close to get a pic.

Also another reasion I think that it is fake is because it says that the face looked like an egyotian pharaoh and it has no resemblence what so ever.

I also think tghat maby the face was made by somone from earth so that thay could make people beleve that there are ailens and that thay are probaly were verrry upset because thay thought that ailens were real and that thay were dangerions.

in the paragraph it says that there spacecraft was circling the earth and that they got photos, i dont think that is true because thay also said that thay were trying to havew it get better pics because it was all cloudy. I think that if it was cloudy than thay would not have as good as picturs.

I also think that thay are verry unedicated about the alian subject and that thay think thay are real and even might say that thay dont have any proof. the proof might scare people so much thay might beleve them and thay actully will care abouth if thay are righy.

Have you ever heard of a planet having a face? Neither have I. Even though there seems to be eyes, a nose, and a mouth, on a planet, does not mean that this sighting can't be a natural landform, and it also doesn't prove that there is life in space.That is why ""The Face"", is just a natural landform.

""The Face"", is just a natural landform because they can't prove that aliens are real. People think that they have seen UFO'S in the sky, but how can they prove that it was not just a shooting star? They can not prove it. Not even the smartest scientist or astronaut can prove that UFO'S are real, because they have no physical evidence, Just like Aliens. Out side of Earth is a completely different system. there is very little ways for aliens and life forms to live there. Yet again, they only have weird sightings like ""The Face"" to explain their reasoning for life in outer space and on other planets.

There is not life in outerspace, or on any planet, even though, the other side would bring up UFO'S,

and bring movies like ""E.T"" to state their proposition, how do we know that these ""UFO'S"" are not just shooting stars or helicoptors, and movies like ""E.T"" are fiction, even though they seem so real and so believable, it is quite obvious that its just not possible. NASA has never had any sighting or any true proof that life does exist outside of our world, and even when they get the slightest and silliest ideas that there is life, they get the worlds hopes up and then when people ask for evidence, they say something like ""there is currently no physical evidence, however research says ""..."". "" You get the picture. it just cant be proved, and most likely wont ever be able to be proved.

finally, ""The Face"", people are obsessed with, is really just a landform, a very cool landform indeed. There were no aliens responsible for this landform, or any other landform. it was most likely, just created by the draft, or by the seasons of the planets, maybe even created by the gases that are in outerspace. That is why the face on the planet is just a natural landform and in no way related to other life. ",4,1,0.7645243406295776
1482f42,"The Mystery of the Unmasking Face on Mars

In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" people think that the face was created by aliens. In this essay I will tell you if the face was created by aliens or if it was just a natural landform. Why would people think this face was created by aliens? Or was it just a natural landform? What would you think about the face being created by aliens?

Now that we got that out of the way, Why would people think that the face was created by aliens? There was not much evidence that the aliens were the ones that created the face. People can not just go around saying that aliens caused the face to happen, Because there was very little proof that it caused by aliens. Garvin also said, ""It reminds him of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" In paragraph 12. And in paragraph 7 it also says that there was no alien momentum after all.

Also, Some people think that the face is just a natural landform. I think that the face was caused why a natural landform because I found more information that the face was caused by a natural landform. Like, in paragraph 7 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo and when the image first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed that it was a natural landform.

I think that if the face was really created by aliens there would have been more evidence or proof saying that aliens had created the face. Because there was more proof saying that the face was created by a natural landform. If there was more proof about the face being created by aliens than it just being a natural landform then I am not sure what I would have done.

Last of all, I found out that there was more proof in the face being created by a natural landform than the face being created by aliens. There was more people talking about how it was not created by aliens and there was also people saying that there was proof saying that the face was created by aliens. But, I would have to say I will stick with there being more proof about the face being created by a natural lanform.      ",3,1,0.8509902954101562
1493f33,"The face on mars that you guys keep hearing about is not in fact a piece of landscape made by aliens. It is a just a form of land like we have; moutains,rivers, pyramids and stuff like that.Just because it's on a different planet doesn't mean it was made by aliens. Do you think the moutains, rivers, and pyramids on earth were made by aliens? Well I did some research on some on this stuff and I looked in a artical called ""Unmasking the Face of Mars."" The text said,"" Scientist figured it was another Martain mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh."" What that information was telling me is that the the pictures they took made it look like a Egyptian pharoh something that's on earth, a shape or some what, so if the planet has wind blowing on it like on our world then the sand on the planet can make a shape of anything. I also was reading in this artical and I saw that it said,"" There was no alien monument after all.""What does that tell you and if you don't believe me I got another explination.

In the artical I was reading the text also states that,"" It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. "" That's a lava dome that takes the formor an islolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars"". I that information quality enough for you. I mean we have volcanos the same size as that form rock. Even though I got some of this information from an artical dosen't mean it's not true even though you guys got that false information from an artical your selves. I know it's the truth because if their were Martains who did this don't you think we would have saw traces of someone building it like hammers and ladders ect. If you really look at the photo it just looks like craiters and sink holes making the shape of a face.I know you played in the sand before and you know that it can just slide through or fall and move by its self.

Thats all it really is to this arguement you opposed with me and if you don't wanna believe me make a ship and go see it for yourself. My final claim is that it is not made by aliens, it's just a natural landform.",3,1,0.8350228667259216
1498b6e,"It is just a face. The Face on Mars is natural. This is evident because it is similar to the landforms here on Earth, and there is no sign of alien or human life.

One may argue that it is possibly a sign of alien life on Mars. They might say that the fact that it does look like a face could mean it was aliens who made it. Maybe they'd argue, ""The timing wasn't right. You can't see all the details."" At that point, they just sound ignorant, but no matter their claim, they are wrong and have no strong evidence in saying it isn't natural.

This Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientists have even compared it to buttes and mesas here on Earth. An example of this comparison was by Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. He said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho stating, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."" Also, Mars is known for being a very dusty and rocky planet. It would be very easy for the formations of Mars to erode together and make such a landform as this.

In addition to it just being a natural landform, there is absolutely no evidence of life near this area or anywhere else. This goes to show that it can't be man/ alien made. The NASA scientists, are using the highest quality cameras in technology today. They zoom in to 1.56 meters per pixel, allowing them to see every little detail. After doing this they found no shelter, no water, no life showing any forms of a civilization. There has never been any life, outside of maybe bacteria, found on Mars, and even if there was, NASA would quadruple their funds after that kind of discovery giving them no reason to hide it.

The Face of Mars is simply a natural landform similar to a butte or mesa similar to those on Earth, with no alien interaction. There is no evidence to say otherwise, and a lot of evidence to back these statements.",4,1,0.871579647064209
14a6a23,"In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo of what seemed to be a face on the surface of Mars. The Face on Mars caused speculation of alien life on Mars. However, the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

One of the reasons that the Face on Mars looks like a face is because of shadows that cause the illusion of facial features. A few days after the Face on Mars was discovered, NASA released the image to the public. On the image was a caption, which stated that the Face was just a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" These shadows that were noted in the caption can easily create the illusion of a human head.

Adding to this, the Viking 1's camera quality was low compared to what we have today. So, the picture isn't all too clear. Every pixel in the clearest picture captured by the Viking 1 covers 43 meters. That's a low resolution compared to other spacecrafts that have photographed the face. One of these spacecrafts is the Mars Global Surveyor. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time in April 5, 1998. When the spacecraft flew over Cydonia, Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times clearer than that of the Viking 1 picture. When the picture was released to the public, it revealed a natural landform. The Face on Mars was nothing more than a rock formation.

Although the pictures were clear, many people say that the pictures taken by the Mars Global Surveyor are unreliable due to them being taken in 1998. The reason for this is that, in 1998, it was winter where the Face was located, which caused a cloudy atmosphere. The Mars Global Surveyor had to peer through the clouds in order to see the Face. This led to many people not being satisfied with the pictures taken. Many skeptics said that the alien markings were hidden by the clouds. The claims that the skeptics made were refuted, however.

On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough to take a second look, and pictures were taken. On that day, there weren't any clouds due the season being summer in Cydonia. On top of there being no obstacles to obscure the vision of the camera, the picture's resolution was at the maximum it could be. Each pixel spanned only 1.56 meters, compared to the Viking 1's picture. The picture revealed the Face to be a landform, just like the other pictures that were taken after the Viking 1 picture. The landform turned out just to be the equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are common in the American West. These landforms happen to be very common in Cydonia, which is why scientists came to the conclusion that it was a mesa before they had even taken more photos. The only difference between this mesa and another one is the shadows it casts, which causes the mesa to look like a face.

In short, the Face on Mars isn't a sign of alien life. Although it looked like a human head, it's really just a mesa. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.   ",5,1,0.8530240654945374

Some scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. So as you read you might think there is something living on Mar's but the Face on Mar's is acually is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms it is common around the American West. A lava dome is the form of the Face on Mar's, "" the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mar's. To Conclusion, A lava dome is the creation of the Face because Mar's is not a place where you are abl;e to live because if you are not able to plant how would you have food to live and temp. get as high as 100 degrees in the morning and as low as 0 degrees at night also there are very bay storms so i do not know if anyone would be able to live on Mar's.",2,1,0.6355438828468323
14cb817,"The thing about the face is, everyone was hoping for a Martian. Thats why so many people were still not saticefied when they saw the second. It isn'tg easy, you know. They all have to do extremely hard work to just get a glimpse at the ""Face."" We have done multiple photos of the face and around the face. If we were trying to hide something, why would we show it to everyone? Those are the crazy things I'm talking about. Un-needed sceptics and conspiracy theorists to question the goals of NASA as a whole, just because we found this and shared it with the world.

There are forms like this all over the world. You can find formations like this anywhere, like in deserts, on rocks, theres no end to it! You can find unusual formations all over the world. However, when its another world, its a completely different story? No. Mars is a desert, and why cant formations like this be found there? The truth is they can. This just seemed interesting so we wanted to share your possible discovery with the world. NASA would have loved to find out that it was a Martian, but that wasn't the case.

The article states people who have seen things like that in the desert. There are multiple whitnesses of that. So in the conclusion of my arguement, I'd like to state, that I believe, and you should to, that the ""Face"" on Mars, Is just a natural formation on the planets amazing surface.",2,1,0.8531284332275391
14d1bfc,"So the other day I was working at NASA just like everyday and something was brought up that I had never heard before. What was brought up was that back in the 70's, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a top region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The person who said this out loud said it was just formations called butte or mesa's which are very common around the American West. What happened was pretty normal at NASA. One of my co workers blurted out it was probably created by aliens. More people started agreeing with him because how else could a human looking face get on a planet that nobody ever talked about. It started to have me thinking about space and all the crazy things that happen, so I decided to do some research when I got home. I looked around the internet, and went to the public library to look for some books about rock formatons on different planets. Once I got those, I finally began research and what I found was shocking. I believe that the face on Mars is not and ancient alein artifact because rock formations form on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed.

I believe that the face found on Mars is not an ancient alien artifact because rock formations form on every planet. research has shown that the face found on Mars looksv like lanforms common around the American West. As far as people know, that face could have just gotten there from some sort of sand storm on the big red planet back in the 70's. Another thing that people shold know is that pictures can be deceving.

I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact because pictures can be deciving. What scientist knew back then, and what they know now is a lot different. There is much more technological advances now then there were back then, so the picture quality from space wasn't very good. It was very pixelated, not clear, and didn't give very much information. It is understandable that people thought it was an alien head but thats just not the truth. The picture quality now is at the highest its ever been so people can see pictures a lot more clearly. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That proves that the image was very deceving and not many people could figure out what it most likely looked like. One more thing that people should really know is that there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.

I believe that the face on Mars was not an anciet alien artifact because there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed. Back in the 70's people thought that aliens were real because the technology wasn't very good, and people olny believed what they were told. In the latest years though, Scientists have no evidence that aliens are real. This proves that there couldn't have been an anciet cicilization of aliens.

Because of these facts, I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact becaue rock formations can be found on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.",5,1,0.8284013867378235
151a2ea,"Alien's have been a question many astronauts and people from all around the world have been wondering about for ages. But do they actually exsit? A few years ago NASA discovered what seemed to look like a face on Mar's surface. Many think that the so called ""Face"" was created by alien's. But others think it was just created by natural causes just like how some landforms are created on Earth. How do you think that the formation was created?

So far NASA hasn't discovered any alien markings or any other form of life on other planets. This is one of the reasons why the formation was created by natural causes and not by alien's. Just like on Earth we discover something new every day, such as new landforms and new natural resources. The formation couldn't of been formed by alien's because where did they get the tools to make it? If aliens exsited, i think we would have more evidence.

Alien's don't exsit becuase we would have found some evidence of diffrent life on diffrent planet's by now. If their are no aliens then their are no alien made objects on Mars. Alien's probably would have found a better communication rought then sending us weird landforms that dont have much meaning at all.

Why of all things would the aliens create a face? Even if aliens did exsit i don't think it is their goal in their life to scare us humans. They would probably make something more reasonable, like a house or something like a shelter.

Along with the formation there are also many landforms on earth that are similar. Such as the Grand Cannon and things like that. Think if the humans lived on Mars and we came to Earth and saw the Grand Cannon we would automatically think that there must be life here since there is no other way this could have been formed. Just as we believe there is life on Mars we would assume their is life here. Untill their is more evidence about alien's we should not believe that they exsit.

As it says in the artical ""What the picture actually shows is the Maritian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" This landform represents many of the already discovered landforms on earth such as the Grand Cannon and their is no official evidence that aliens exsit this is obviously a naturally formed landform and not created by aliens.

151a470,"Do you ever wonder if the face on mars is just a landform? I've thought about it and I have read this story called ""Unmasking The Face on Mars"" this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.

When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption ""...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth."" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This ""face"" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.

Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head..."" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage ""It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.

Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that ""the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.""(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.

After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars"" is just a landform. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all. ",4,1,0.8652260303497314

""The face"" became very popular when Nasa first sent it to the public. Also on paragraph 7 the author states that when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia ,they found out that ""the face"" was just a regular natural landform. In the year of 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor was able to snap a picture of the landform, as said by Garvin

""the picture actually showed the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa- landforms common around the American West"". I don't think the landform is an ancient artifact or any alian artifact i just think its a normal landform that happens to look like a human or alian face. Even if Nasa was lying to us the landform benefits Nasa. When they first snapped the photograph and shared it with the public it received alot of public attention. Many people funded the missions to snap more photographs of the landform to get a better look at it. It was basically was a waste of time and money because it ended up being just a regular landform and not an alian artifact as the world believed it was at the time.   ",2,1,0.8398513793945312

Some scientist including me think it was just a natural landform. Other scientist think it was created by aliens,but I highly doubt it was.

I'm here working with one of the other scientist, and we're talking about the Face that appeared on Mars. The scientist thinks that the face was madeby aliens but I think it wasn't that it's just a natural landform.

It was a natural landform because the caption that we put for people to see was "" huge rock formation..... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The face was just a rock formation that gave the illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth becuse it was just a shadow that we were seeing.

However the scientist doesn't think that. He thinks that the face was made by aliens. He says that there is no way it was just a natural landform that aliens made this as a sign for something.

He believes that it was a sign for something that the aliens were going to end up doing. But I told him that it was a natural landform because when we waited to get the best picture in 1998 all we saw was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

But of course not everyone was satisfied.

It was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

I think even though some people still may think it was made by aliens, we all know that it is just a natural landform and it wasn't made by aliens.

I after all did convince the scientist that I was working with, that the Face was just a natural landform and it wasn't made by aliens . But all we have to do now is to convince everyone else that it was just a natural landform. I believe that the Face is just a landform because of so many reasons. So what do you think?

Do you think it was just a natural landform or it was made by aliens? ",3,1,0.8939869999885559
15a4102,"An alien spieces exist on Mars? The ""Face"" is an object believed to be created by aliens. Some believe this, and some do not. The Face is not created by aliens.

The Face is a natural landform which is supported by evidence. In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft flew by and saw a object that looked like a face on Mars. However, in 1976, the cameras weren't that high-resolution, so it would make things seem different. In 1998, NASA went back to check it out and found out it was just a mesa. In 1998, NASA had better equipment to take pictures of and had better definition. For example, the text states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform."" The text also cites, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.""

Others may say that the Face is created by aliens because of many reasons. The people who believe in the theory of the Face being created by aliens may say that the NASA just hides the proof. The story quotes, ""...evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" In 1998, NASA took a picture and revealed a landform, however some were not shaken of their beliefs. Others say that NASA didn't take it at the correct latitude and season. In the text, it says, ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees noth martian latitude where it was winter in April '98--a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" Some believed it was hidden by clouds. An example of this in the story is ""The camera board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.""

The Face is a natural landform, and aliens didn't create it. Does an alien species live on Mars? The ""Face"" is believed to be made by aliens. Some believe this, and some don't. ",3,1,0.8598963022232056

While doing so a strange face appeared, (yes I said face) on Mars mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab had their jaws dropped in the image being displayed in front of them, but the excitment was short lived until scientist quickly pointed out it was just another Martian mesa of which was pretty common in the area.

Then a couple days after NASA reveiled the face on Mars hoping to spark up some attention toward the Red Planet. Did they get quick results! The face was admired by many, but this started theories that aliens on Mars created the wierd sensation.

When the Viking took the picture it wasn't as clear so on April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor went to Cydonia to take a sharper picture to display towards anxious web surfers, once taken the image appeared on the web site revealing unfortunantly a natural landform.

15e8c3a,"When it comes to alien life forms, people on Earth have found very few signs that they exisit. With the signs we have found, our technology now a days has proved the aritifacts to be just conspiracies. One of the great conspiracies of aliens started with a picture in 1976. The picture was from a part of Mars that wasn't explored very often. Since people have been curious about aliens for years, they blew the picture out of proportion which started a chain reaction of people thinking that aliens were among us.

One of the many reason that prove this landform wasn't made by aliens is that the technology wasn't very advanced when the picture was first taken. This first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Viking 1 was taking pictures of Mars when the camera took a very hazy and blurred picture of a really big rock. Since the technology wasn't very advanced at the time, scientists couldn't see if the rock was shaped like a face or just shadows reflecting off of the rock to make it look like a face. No one was very certain what it was.

Since no one knew exactly what the rock was, the public took the opportunity to make a really big deal about it. Back in the 70's and 80's aliens were a big deal. People wanted to believe that aliens were among us. Because the rock looked like a face, people wanted to know if the Face was made by aliens or if it was just another landform. To get the public stirring, there were movies, books, magazines, and radio talks shows about it to give consumers what they wanted, a real life alien colony.

In 2001, NASA decided to get another picture of the Face. When the picture was sent out to the public, all of the rave about the Face was snuffed out because the picture looked exactly like a landform. Scientists then closed all exploration on the Face because the picture didn't look anything like a Face. It just looked like a plain, old, boring mesa. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Program even said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in Idaho. Since the picture was so exact, if there was any life in the picture, the scientists could've seen it in the picture.

Aliens are still being researched today, but back in 1976, the rave of the Face created by aliens was all fake. Since the picture taken in 1976 in so blurry, we can't see exactly if it's a face or not. Then when the new picture was taken in 2001, we could easily see that the Face that was made by aliens was actually just a mesa or butte. All of the publicity that the Face got was just because at the time people wanted to know if there were actually aliens out there. The public have started some crazy conspiracies, but this one about the alien Face will always be remembered as one of the craziest conspiracies in space exploration history.",4,1,0.7752013802528381

When the sciencetists saw the first picture taken of it they figured it was just another martian mese, that was common around Cydonia. The image was captioned ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head..."" It was just a landform and had nothing to do with aliens. Just because it looked like a human head doesnt mean anything. Very few scientists even belived the face was created by aliens. Which means that most of them knew it was just a natural landform.

When the second picture was taken, all they saw was just a natural landfrom with no alien monument at all. They then took a third picture of it because most people were not satisfied with the second one. The thrid picture just shows the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa. It looks like landforms here around earth. If their are similar things on Earth that are just landforms then the face on Mars is just a landform too.

The face on Mars was not made by aliens it was just a landform. It just happened to look like a human face in the first picture that was taken. But with the better pictures, It wasnt a face after all. It was just a mesa.",3,1,0.9301426410675049
15fa958,"The face that was found of Mars by NASA can be proven that its just a natural landorm. The face does resemble human feature but they are just illusions given by the shadow around it giving it eyes,nose, and mouth.

The face is a martian mesa that is common enough to be found around Cydonia, where the face land formation was found. In April 5,1998 when they took a picture of the face it was 10 times sharper than the originals Viking photos it showed that there was no alien monument after all, so it was clear that it is a natural landrom rather than alien made landform.

The face is just like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, the face and the Middle Butte are both natural landfroms and not alien made. Pictures of the face were taken clearer because people still thought that it was from by aliens, but the technology they use were better than the first technology they use, the picture they took still showed no marks of alien made land formtion.

NASA use technology like Mars Orbiter Carmera and Viking's Camera. However the public still doesn't believe that the land formation of the face is a natural landform,to say that

NASA wouldn't lie about the face being a natural landforms because they actually benefit from finding a face that was made by aliens.

Nevertheless when NASA took a picture in April 8,2001 they had used a camera that have an image spans of 1.56 meters per pixel, if there were any objects on the ground even small shacks could seen and know what they were. But what they found in the picture was that the martin equivalent of a butte or mesa of landform that are common around American West. By this comparsion it showed that the face is more likely to be a natural landform rather than a landform made by alien.

To finalize it, the face that was found on Mars is just a natural land formations and not an alien land formation, because with the high tech camera NASA used it would be able to showed any kind of details that alien could possiblely made mark on the landform would be shown in the picture but none of the evidence were found; which shows that the face is more likey to be

a natural landform.        ",4,1,0.9024001359939575

I believe it is just a landform, and here's why, there has been photos that have been taken since the original 1976 photo that said that it was a face. What the 2001 photo has shown us is that it is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A butte or a mesa are common around the American West. JIm Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program had said that it ""eminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars."" Secondly, I believe that it is a landform because NASA has photographed this photo more than once to determine if it was an alien atrifact and after their second trip to Cydonia, they had enough information to say it is a martian landform. So in 1998, they had waited nearly eighteen years since the first photos of the face. The research crew took a new photo of the face that is ten times sharper than the 1976 photo. When it was released to the public, it had turned out to be a natural landform, not an alien monument. Lastly, I believe it is a nautral landform because in the 2001 photo of the landform, the Mars Global Surveyor took a new photo of the face using the camera's maximum resolution ""Each pixel spanned 1.56 meters, while the 1976 photo had spanned 43 meters. So, this abolishes the possibility of it being an alien artifact because if there were any egyptian style pyramids you would have been able to see them"" These are the facts that I believe determine that the face on mars is just a landform and not an alien artifact.

1608b25,"The Face On Mars

Have you ever seen something crazy on something, maybe a face or something that you seen before? Have you thought about how that face or something else has gotten there? Well, for a start it defintley wasn't aliens! Just like the face on mars, people belive that the face was created by aliens! But that isn't true, the face on mars is just and only a natural landform that some how was created on earth.

For my first reason on why the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because NASA later revelied that the face was not made of aliens, but by shadows. A few days after that image was found, NASA needed to take a look and figure out what made this incredible and scientififc picture so unique, and why and how it was formed. Later on, they have came up with an good explaination about this unique image. NASA said this,""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Scientifically, the face was made from a natural cause, so it makes it a very different natural landform.

Now, for my second reason on why this was not made by aliens, but just a natural landform is that there is no scientific research showing that aliens do exist and created this face. Now I do know that some people say that they have seen aliens, but scientists dont think that is one hundred percent true because they don't have any evidence suggesting that aliens are real. Many people to belive in them, but how do we know that they are actually real without any scientific knowledge? But now after NASA did some research, they found out that even though we don't have information about them, aliens did not create that face, it was only a natural landform.

For my third and final reason, why the face was not created by aliens and is only a natural landform , is because in the last paragraph,paragraph twelve, they talk about how the the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. Since the landform shows a butte or mesa, that means that the image was a major landform that came from the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He also said,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, this is not only a natural landform, but a major natural landform.

I do agree a little bit about aliens creating the face. Maybesomewhere in space, there are aliens that created something else or not. One day maybe we can find something out in space that has something to do with aliens, but today is just isn't the day to do that. But overall, i would have to agree that aliens did not create this, but this is only a natural landform created by something other than aliens.

As you can see, this creative landform was most defintley not created from aliens, but just a nice natural landform. Scientists now figured out that this ""Face on Mars"" is from shadows and not from aliens. This landform is actually a butte or a mesa which is very intersting to have found out. Many people did belive that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, but scientists haven't found out if there are aliens or not, so we shouldn't jump into conclusion. But overall, this face was defintely a landform and not created by aliens!!",5,1,0.9041674137115479
160bab7,"The face on Mars has been said to be created by many things. ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.""(paragraph 5) Other people believe that it is a natural landform. It could have been aliens, but we have yet to find life on Mars. The reason that makes the most sense as to why its there is that it is indeed a natural landform.

Sure the land may look like a face but it is simply a natural landform. It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too. They are common around the American West. These are called buttes or mesas, and buttes are simply ""a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.""(paragraph 12)

This landform even reminds people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976. And lastly in 2001, it just looks like a simple mesa, no face, no alien markings.

I do realize that it might make sense to you and other people that it could be made by aliens. But we have yet to find actual life on mars, let alone have it be made by non-existent creatures. This object object may seem extraordinary, but it is simply just a mesa on a planet we haven't even found running water on. I would love to say ""Yes, this was actually made by aliens!"" but sadly I cannot because it is simply just a landform.

Therefore it could not have been created by aliens because these landforms appear on Earth. It looks similar to landforms on Earth. It also has been photographed many times over the years with better cameras each time. Scientist can gladly say ""This is only a landform, in fact these also appear on Earth as mesas or buttes."" In conclusion, this is just a natural landform that was not created by other-worldly beings on Mars. ",4,1,0.8619647026062012
1618e72,"The media is everywhere. Everyday, you hear gossip about celebrities in magazines, movies, and social media. Millions of movies and magazines are released all of the time around the world. More than half of the time, the facts they tell us aren't even close to accurate. You can't always trust the Media, especially when including scientific facts. Twenty five years ago something peculiar happened on Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars, taking pictures, and spotted a Martian Mesa. The Media is lying to all of us. Are they honestly trying to get us to believe that the Mesa is something that was created by aliens? That's purposturous. If ""aliens"" did however create the Mesa, NASA would benifit from it.

You can't trust information from movies or magazines because most of the time, they are false accuzations. Most of the ""facts"" they tell us about are completely untrue. There isn't enough scientificly proven facts to believe what magazine and movie writers are telling us. The Mesa is just a huge rock formation, not an alien created object. NASA is a very sophisticated scientific group, trust the information they tell us, not false information.

I understand that few scientists believe that aliens somehow created the Mesa. But, an extremely large amount of scientists highly disagree. There is absolutley no scientific proof of aliens created the Mesa on Mars. NASA has stated that it's just a rock formation. if aliens created it, NASA would release that information.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin took his Mars Orbiter Camera to fly to Cydonia where he would take a picture of the rock formation. He later revealed on a JPL website, that it was just a nautral landform. NASA's information is always correct. Thanks to Michael Malin, we have proof that the Mesa is just a rock formation.

In conclusion, NASA has provided all of us with many accurate facts about the Martian Mesa. Some people still choose to argue, even though NASA has already provided us with all of the right answers. I hope I have pursuaded you to think more into the facts that are scientifically correct, unlike the Media's version of the story.            ",4,1,0.5658872723579407
165492b,"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform there was no real evidence of it being showned to be formed by aliens.

As

I looked at the evidence and the photos that the scienctist gave me they showed that in 1976 the face was full of dust and etc. Which could have formed the face from probably erosion of the dust or even the illusion of the human eyes,mouth, and nose .

For Example in the article I read a passage that said ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact"" , they had no real proof of it being this .

Then another photo that I recieved from the team in 1998 showed that Face started to show as if it was unmasking itself for us to see, which had probably given NASA the thought of it being an alian artifact , but still they had no real proof of it being this .

I read a passage and it said "" And so on April 5,1998 , when Mars Global Surveyor few over Cydonia for the first time ,Miachael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos .Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the first image appeared on JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

But still not evryone was actually satisfied . So on April 8,2001 (MGS) drew close enough for a second look . And Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each Pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters , compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

In Conlusion, there was never any real proof of the Face on Mars being an alien monument the only proof that NASA had was based off of opinions. They had no Factual evidence.   ",3,1,0.8917295932769775

We have no idea what we are talking about as people who do not work at NASA because we are not people that work there that can see what actually it is. I do believe that the pictures do look like a face but over the years in these pictures it comes to me to believe it is just a rock. I think it is a rock or something of that sort because rocks sometimes deteriorate and look like funny shapes.

The Viking 1 may have even taken the pictures wrong and people just do not know about it. I mean has anyone even landed there and tried to dig it up or even go down with tools or materials to discover what it may be. From this passage all that said is that the Viking 1 was looking for a place for his sister to land and it took a picture of it.

Nobody can believe reporters all the time either because most reporters just here what they want to and write about that. That is why you can't always believe what you here.Although myself I do tend to do that a lot but i do not believe things that can most likely not be possible. For instance we have always thought that aliens live on mars and we make these movies about things we have never seen before.

The face on mars could be something but people will just go out of context with it and mzke it come alive in movies. Which if there is something out there I think it is very mean if they do see it. Which is why I myself do not believe in things like this.

The face on mars has been about 3-4 centurys now and still no one has done anything so i think they should either get on it or just leave it alone. I would like to know what it is but I would only wantto here it from NASA itself to believe it.",2,1,0.6950164437294006

The landform in the moon is not a face because, scientist have proven actual facts on this topic. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the first image appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" In addition, i also believe that there is no way face could just randomly appear inside of the moon monument because, I think there are no sure thing as aliens.

There are many landforms that have been created with face like forms but that does not mean aliens have created them. For example NASA stated that they take photos of mars all the time, year round to use on research if there were aliens then why have they not been seen or found in any of this phots they take.

The text also states that scientist belive its just a natural landform. Also there are many rocks that we find and many landforms that look like faces and different types of objects but we never assum that they were created by aliens. These landforms are called or campered to butte or mesa landforms. Also if there were aliens then how did they make this landform and how did the ""alien"" even get there or survive on that plante.

If there even were aliens then were are they because if they lived on mars we would definetly be able to see them and see where they were living.

1763449,"""Unmasking the AFace on Mar's""

Many people beleive there is other life forms on Mars. Recently NASA Found an odd landform on Mars in the region Cydonia. The landform looks exactly like a human's face. People claim that this Face looks like a great Egyption Pharoh, and that the Face was created by other life forms or ""aliens."" But, Cydonia is a region known for its various mesa's and landforms. Still the Face caught many veiwers attention.

Since, Cydonia has various landforms it led NASA to beleive that the Face was just some other natural landform. Garvin says in paragraph 12,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This peice of evidence proves that the landform could very easilly be natural. For Earth has hundreds of natural landforms.

So, when the Face hit Hollywood people went wild and decided that it must be aliens. Conspiracy theorists claim,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide."" This claim makes people even more skeptical of how the Face was actually formed. The Face began to show up in magazines and movies. People sharing how they beleive the Face actually formed. Even though many people wanted to beleive there was life on Mars(including NASA) they had to stick to the evidence.

On April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor was nearing the Face. It was a cloudless day and Garvin and his team were hard at work adjusting the Spacecraft so it would center the Face in the camera for a clear photo. When it came time,""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" The clear photo helped prove that the Face was actually just a natural landform. That was caused by an isolated mesa.

Although, many people want to beleive that alien's created this odd landform called the Face. A lot of evidence proves other wise. Cydonia is a place known for mesa's and Earth has hundreds of odd landforms that seem to be Alien. Think that one day you could visit the Face of Mars istead of The Man in the Moon!

There was also very similar rocks in the Amerucan West that formed naturally as well and that showed the the space rock can be formed the same way the other rocks were formed. As Garvin says in the article ""it reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

The Face is a Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common enough around Cydonia, so it's possible for them to be in that area. Also, the Face isn't the only mesa on Mars. This one just has unusual shadows that makes it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. These shadows made the pictures illusions because it looked liked a human face.

There are other natural landforms there. Next to the Face is another mesa but it doesn't have the same look as the Face. All of the other things on Mars haven't been made by aliens so this one isn't either. The other landforms on Mars have been naturally made.

17a53de,"On May 24, 2001, NASA found something funny on Mars. The Viking 1 spacecraft was taking photos of possible landings sites for Viking 2. During that time, it spotted something that appeared to be an enormous head. It looked like an Egyptian pharoah, but turned out to be a regular, old mesa. It is still debated whether it was created by ancient Martian life, or whether is was just another regular landform on Mars.

My fellow co-workers and I thought this was incredible. We had just found something that could have proven ancient life on Mars. It turned out that it wasn't. Later, we figured out that it was another regular Martian mesa. We were so excited when we thought we had just found proof of earlier life on Mars. We thought we had just made one of the greatest scientific discoveries there has ever been. We were joyful when we saw the Face. We thought we found proof of ancient alien life without even looking for it.

Some people think that the mesa was actually created by aliens. In paragraph 5, it says that people thought NASA was just trying to hide all of the information. To be honest, we were hoping it was proof of alien life. We wanted to find proof of alien life. Why would we hide that information? That just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

The Face is just a landform. In paragraph 2, it says that Marian mesas were common in the area the Face was in, Cydonia. Also, the shadows were the only things that made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. All that says is that a landform could be lucky and have some features that amde it resemble someone. Plus, how would Martians know what a Pharaoh looks like? They would be from Mars and not Earth. They most likely don't know anyone that even looks like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information? I'll leave you to decide that.

This scenario occured on May 24, 2001 when there was a strange dent on Mars. This event was advertized in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for twenty-five years. Why did the news about this event linger around for this long?

When the dent in Mars was spotted, NASA investigated to determine what could have created such a mark. In paragraph three, it states that the mark resembled a human face that contained the following features, eyes, nose, and a mouth. It also states that the authors of NASA discussed that this finding would be a great way to lure the public into wanting to know more about Mars. If NASA could get the public interested enough, then the station would recieve an abundant amout of attention. This could make the station wealthy so that their budget would thrive and they could avoid any financial issues.

NASA gathered information by capturing photos of the face-like inprint on Mars. In paragraph seven, the article states that on April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and their team captured a picture ten times more accurate photo than the Vikings. Keep in mind that the sharp photos were taken in 1998; and that the Viking photo from 2001, in the top section of the article, is less detailed than the one taken in 1998. Technology, such as cameras, continues to improve the quality of pictures, not decrease the quality.

NASA not only does their research based on facts and history, but they also base it off of land forms. In paragraph twelve, it states that the picture taken actually shows a landfrom that is common around the American West. If NASA stopped drawing the public in by giving this information, then others would lose interest and NASA would then struggle to thrive and suceed. They could loose money, supporters, and others who make their station function. Why would a company want to put themselves in danger, especially NASA where many bright individuals that can help the future?

The article provides statements and facts in paragragh three, five, seven, and twelve to abolish the theory that there was ever a dent in Mars that could be an aliens face. Also, provided for you at the top of this article you can examine the photos that have been taken. Do not forget that you can not always believe everything that you hear or see, there is always the possibility of an error. This information proves to the public that there was no face on Mars.

The face is just a big rock that could have been formed from eroding rock and metiorites hitting the surface of the planet. As you can see the face does become eroded from 1976 through 2001. If it was created by aliens the rock formation would have stayed in tact possibly. It would not have eroded, it could have a few chizzle marks but other than that it would still look perfectly clear. Also if the face was created by aliens then it would have ment some kind of symbol.

On mars so far there is no possible way ro live there without certain eqipment. There is so far no possible way that the rock could have been made by aliens or anciet civilizations because they couldn't survive without water and the pressure on their head could have killed them. If it was made by ancient civilizations this would mean that there was water somewhere on mars at sometime which is impossible since it is somewhat close to the sun and all the water would have been dried up in probably in about a week.

In conclusion if at sometime there was any trace of aliens or ancient civilization on that planet they wouldn't have survived. If they did they would have been able to keep a generation on that planet and water. So the face is just a rock that has been eroded. ",2,1,0.8470735549926758

Using the evolution of technology and cameras we have taken multiple pictures to prove what it is. Here I will explain what we did to take pictures of this mysterious thing.. We will also explain why people believed us to be wrong.

In 1976 the Viking 1 took pictures so we could find a good landing spot for the sister ship The Viking 2. That is when the pictures the ship took were sent back to us to examine. That is when we first saw the 2 mile long face for the first time. The suprise was short lived however as we soon relised what it was,a messa. People were sure it was more than that. They believed it to be a space craft.

In 1998 we sent a different ship,the Mars Global Surveyor, back there to locate the face and to take better pictures of the face. People were still not impressed with the finding of the MGS. There was fog in the picture as the area the face is in is always foggy. They said the fog was obsurring the photo. They also belived that aliens were using fog to hide it and some alien space crafts they belived was surrounding the face. They picture without the fog to beleive what we saw.

In 2001 we again sent the MGS to take pictures of the face. We went on a clear summer day when there was no fog presant and we had to tilt the camera 25 degress to get the picture right on. This picture had the face bigger than a thum compared to the pixel sized faces before it. It was exacly the picture they need to prove it was a messa.

As you can see in the photos it is a messa on a different plant. Comparring it to Earth it would be just like the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The eyes nose and mouth were just shadows being casted onto it which is why the other pictures have the feature while the new one does not . After 25 years of people talking and theorizing about it on the new and on the radio we can finally put an end to this mystery.",3,1,0.8450449109077454

Although this face was unexpected,that doesn't nessasarily define that the face has anything to do with aliens. There are majority of theories we can assume from this topic. Few scientist condoned that this mysterious face had something to do with a very unordinary prediction .Some scientist seemed surprised when they saw the photograph of the face on mars.

As a scientist, many mistakes are made during observations, but that's apart of human life. Mistakes are casual in everyday life and, all of us make them. In my opinion, I don't think this entertaining outbreak had anything to do with aliens. In fact, they're wasn't a specific sign, or clue that an alien was actually was involved. NASA got a great shot at the face, and the picture closely showed that their was nothing do be deeply concerned about.

The face was defineitly rare, but over the years the face continues to fade so it shouldn't be harmful. If it happened to really be an alien, we would know from the recordings, and pictures that were captured. This is a huge topic to discuss, and space can likely be considered as a horrifying setting due to rumors, and scientific observations. Astrounaunts never discovered any issues, or new assumptions by traveling to space.

The main point is aliens aren't realistic, you may see them in movies, books, or perhaps may hear about them. An alien was never discovered by NASA, and the face just appeared to be a natural cause. The face could of been anything, but we know it wasn't an alien because there is no proof that the face was an alien, and still isn't as we speak.

In conclusion, think about other things that are possible.                                                                                 ",3,1,0.8007493019104004

18d08e8,"The face-like structure found on mars is just a natural landform. It looks like landfroms we would find on Earth and the photograph we took in 2001 says the same thing. Consider the following reasons why this landform was not created by aliens.

First of all, the landform looks like a mesa or butte from the American West. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program, says ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The author of this article says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" The Face is not made by aliens. It is just a landform the happend to look like a face.

Second reason is this. The landform that looks like a face is the same as the other matian equivalent to buttes of mesas. There are other mesas on Mars it just happens that this one looks like a face. If you look at a 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars, you see there is another mesa or butte below the Face. This mesa or butte has no special form or image. It is just another mesa or butte. The Face is not made by aliens. It is just a natural landform the happend to look like a face.

The last reason why the Face was not made by aliens is because in 2001 NASA took a new, clear picture that shows the landform is not a face. In 1976 the Viking 1 took a photo that looked like a face. This is where the idea of aliens making the Face came into play. In 1998 a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) took a picture that did not quite look like a face but did not quite look like a nature land form either. It convinced some it was natural and some still believed that it was made by aliens. The author says, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look...What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" The picture of the Face from the MGS in 2001 convinced most people that this was really a natural landform and the Face was just a coincedence.

The Face found on Mars is not made by aliens. It is a natural landform called a mesa or a butte. The picture of 1976 is misleading and out of date. The newest picture taken in 2001 shows the real, updated version. The landform is a mesa not an alien made creation.  ",4,1,0.8781957030296326

""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars"" (NASA 1). NASA is just trying to get Mars attention. NASA didn't take a really good picture in 1976, but then later on they did and they saw it was just a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is just another Marian mesa just that this one has unusual shadows. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"" (NASA 1).

190ca77,"Have you ever heard of the Face on Mars? Do you believe in life on Mars? The Face on Mars was first discovered in 1976, but gained a gargantuan amount of attention in 2001 (paragraph 1). Conspiracy theorists belive that the Face on Mars is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, however this theory is false (paragraph 5). The Face on Mars is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa (paragraph 12). This can be proven by understanding that Martian mesas are common (paragraph 2); realizing that in the 2001 photo if something was near the Face, NASA would have been able to see it

(paragraph 11); and acknowledging the fact that the Face on Mars resembles natural structures on Earth (paragraph 12).

First, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because Martian mesas are common. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh,"" (paragraph 2). The fact that Martian mesas are common makes the idea of the face on Mars being a natural martian Mesa more logical. This is because there are more natural landforms called Martian Mesas on Mars than just the Face.

In addition, the Face on Mars in a natural landform because in the 2001 NASA photo, if there was Martian life people would have been able to see it (paragraph 11). ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" (paragraph 11). ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" (paragraph 11). This means that no matter what was near the Face on Mars during the photo, people would have been able to see what it was.

Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,"" (paragraph 12). The Face on Mars is quite similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho (paragraph 12). The fact the Face on Mars is resemblant to natural landforms on Earth makes it more understandable that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. This is because this lets people know that these types of natural landforms are possible, and that they are even common.

Conspiracy theorists may say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars , and that NASA would rather hide this evidence (paragraph 5). However, in the 2001 photo of the Face there was no other evidence of life on Mars (paragraph 11). Also, the Face is considered a mesa which are very common on Mars (paragraph 3).Therefore these peoples' theories are not true.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is definitely a natural landform. This is because it is considered a Martian mesa which are common around Cydonia (2). Also, the Face on Mars can be justified as a natural landform because if their was any Martian life located near the Face on Mars during the 2001 NASA photo, people would have been able to see it and tell what it was. Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth.  ",5,1,0.8883377909660339

The first image that makes the natural landform look like a face had low resloution compared to the other images.

If there were any sort of things they built you would be able to see due to the size of the images and the resolutoin of it.

If there some sort of lifeform on mars nasa would get more funding.

They were getting everyone atteieion. They were making everyone wonder if there was some sort of alien life form on mars that could have created that ""face"". They would have gotton so much money to go investigte what was on nasa and they would've got paid so much money.

The origanal viking image had very low resolution compred to the ones taken 1998 and 2001.

Michel malin and his MOC team took some photos that were ten times clearer than the origanal viking photos. some conpiarcy theoists thought that they hid some alien marking. Nasa did not hide anything you can clearley see in that in the photos taken after the origanal viking photo.

The later images taken after orignal viking image were clear enough and largened enough to see any type of building of sorts of that but none were seen so there must be none.There were 1.56 meters per pixel in the orignal image but in the 2001 image there was 43 meters per pixel.

There is no reason for nasa to lie about there being no alien life form on mars,the later image had good enough resolution to tell whats there and whats not and there is no building or aircraft or anything of that sort there expect a piece of rock.

192dd1b,"Sometimes having to be a scientist is not the best idea. Scientist discover different things at different paces,such as the ones that these scientists discovered on Mars. This face that the scientists discovered have evidence that it is just a natural landform. It could also be proven that the face that was found on Mars was not created by aliens. This face was is the face of an alien,and it is going to be proven in this argumentative essay.

First off,the face that was found has no signs of being an alien because any planet has those wierd funky looking holes right? It could have been that with the temperature and time those holes could have appeared making it look like a human face. It could of just simply have been a coincidence that it happened like that. Either way we could say that maybe it was an alien or just a natural landform,nobody has been able to personally prove it because there has not been one astronaut that has went up to Mars and looked at it with its own eyes. The human being has made assumptions about a lot of different things and the majority of the time the human being is incorrect because they do not have evidence to prove that what they said was correct.

Next,lets say that maybe the human being is correct,how could scientists prove that it is what the human being suspects?

In the article in paragraph 2 it reads,""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa,common enough around Cydonia,only this one had usually shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh."" In this part of the reading the author of this article are saying that it could have just been another Martian mesa,but that this one had the unusual shadows that make it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. Like it says in the text it could have just been the shadows something that make it look like an ancient Egyptian Pharoh. It could have maybe been that Martian that the scientists have said it is.

Finally,in this situation scientists might be correct again. It could only be a natural landform that formed with the weather or something different that helps little things like these form up. There are no certain clues or evidence that this ""face"" could be a human or an ancient Egyptian Pharoh. Sometimes the human being wants to suspect things that are not close or correct to what a specialized scientist can do. Sometimes it is just probably that the human brain gets carried away by what it looks at. Sometimes it helps to pay close attention to what we are doing or looking at, for the hiumans good.",3,1,0.7906665802001953
194ce55,"Imagine finding what looked like to be an alien monument on a different planet. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, Cydonia, and taking photos of possible landing sites for Viking 2. The spacecraft took a photo of a landform that looked like a human head. NASA sent out the image for everyone to see and it got a lot of attention. People have started making assumptions as if that proves there is life on other planets, it was an Egyptian Pharaoh, and many more. NASA proved that there was no alien monument, but not everyone agreed. The landform on Cydonia is not an alien monument.

Many people think that this landform on Cydonia is an Egyptian or alien landform. The text states,""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added.""So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" NASA concludes that the landform is just a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. Jim Garvin compared the landform to the Middle Butte in Idaho. Garvin found that they were about the same height. The face is a landform that has shadows casting on it to give it the form of a face.

In conclusion, the landform on Cydonia is just a mesa with shadows casting on it that make it look like a face. NASA has taken many photos to prove this evidence and has compared this to other mesas on Earth. Many people still don't believe the proven evidence and still believe they are alien monuments. People believe the markings of aliens were hidden by a haze, so NASA took photos on clear days to prove that it is just a mesa. The face on Cydonia is just a mesa and not an alien monument.

Aliens are not real because if they were they wouldn't be living on Mars because there's no life on Mars they most likey would invade Earth as we know it. Whatever you seen on Mars it was just a natural landform. If aliens were real they would have almost the same things we have like two eyes, mouth, and two feet, and two ears. The difference between us would be either brown, or gray.

I think aliens aren't real because the face which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

195da78,"This landform on mars does look like a alien face but is just another regular landform. It doesn't prove any aliens are on mars because it is another martian mesa with really good shadow placement to fool the eye. NASA isn't trying to hide anything about aliens or extraterrestrial life because they want to find life on another planet like mars. Even if there was a alien civilazation, why isn't there any more of these or different formation and buildings on mars. That is why it is just a regular landform on mars.

Well this mesa is fooling people because it does look like a face but it is just another mesa The shadow are just placed coincedentily. The landform is pretty big so it coudln't be built fast enough for it to go unnoticed. plus NASA isn't hiding anything, why would they need to. That is one of the reasons why I think it is a coincedent.

Even though NASA seems like they want to cover it they really don't want to because it will be the biggest find ever in space age history. We send probes and rovers for research and to find life. We also send then to find the necessary elements for life to exist. If we do find life it will be the biggest news for a long time. So we really aren't trying to hide anything exspecially aboutr life on mars.

So if there was life on mars and they did make it ,why aren't there any other structures built. Like on earth aztecs did die out but had way more monuments to their gods. They didn't spend all their time building a face Plus their buildings couldn't erode away or the face would't be there. So why did they only build one ?

Those are the reasons I believe face on mars is just coincedental. We really would want to find something on mars. If we do find someting on mars the face could be evidence that there is life on mars. We will probably find out soon. Maybe find alien life on another planet.    ",3,1,0.8069640398025513
1973fe0,"People who think the Face was created by aliens are illogical. Some people think that because they dont believe its a land form, it looks man-made, and NASA hasnt shown any proof of the Face showing that it is a landform. The people have no explanation how the Face was created or what created it.

People think the Face was made by aliens because all they have seen were pictures. The pictures only showed shadows that outlined eyes, a nose, and a mouth of a human face. When NASA released this news it attracted attention to Mars because there was a conspiracy that there was ancient civilization or life on Mars, which people thought were aliens.

Next, The people didn't believe NASA's theory that the Face was a natural landform because in the picture that the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take showed that there was wispy clouds indicating it was winter around that time. The people blamed the clouds that they couldn't see the markings on the Face because they were hidden by clouds. People also said that the Face was bona fide evidence so NASA would rather hide the Face instead of announcing the information to the public. But some defenders of the NASA budget said they wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars because they would make more money off of the publicity of the ""alien"" made landform.

Last but not least, NASA began to take closer photos of the Face to prove to the people that it was a natural landform made by shadows. So they went 25 degress closer to the center of the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an amazing photograph using the camera's maximum resolution meaning zoom point. This photo made the Face three times bigger than its actual size on Mars. So that means if there were any objects like alien people you would've been able to see them clearly in the zoomed up photo.

Garvin said, ""that the picture of the Face reminds him of the most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Garvin said this because NASA found out what the picture actually showed which was the Martian equivalent to a butee or mesa. Which were landforms that were common around the American West. The Middle Butte is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

I agree to NASA's side for leading the investigation of the Face besides just telling the public that there was alien life on Mars. They used the right information like photos and descrbe how the Face was made by shadows which really looked like an human face. The public thought there was life on Mars because when NASA took the pictures there was cloud in the way because it was winter in Mars's time. Also they thought since they've only seen photos NASA was hidjng information from them so they would'nt get bombarded with press and other stations when NASA really wanted the publicity and more money for more reserch.

NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping pictures of possible landing sites for Viking 2, then it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. It seemed to be staring back at the cameras on Viking 1. These photos were taken from the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.

Viking 1 took a picture of something call a butte or mesa. They're most common in the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars. Their is one in the Snake RIver Plain in Idaho.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

19dee01,"I would tell them that how could an alien do that if they have never seen a human. I would explain to them that its kind of hard to turn a rock into that, that is why i would think its natural. But since the rock looks like that it would attract attention to mars and it would make people want to pay and learn more about it. I would also say that thr face on mars has been in a few films,books,magazines,and radio tallk shows because when people found out about it it was a top/ very popular thing.

But things would be more truthful or realistic if there was some type of civilization,war,or history about people living there, like in the 700 B.C earlier and later than that. People that would believe in the aliens would want more info or proof. Talking to my scientist co-worker they want to keep going taking better picks so it looks better and so they see if there is any alien marks. But it is very hard for them to search and look for things like Cydonia for example. Its also very hard for them to take pictures of it when its winter because of the clouds and dust.

But in 2001 each images spans where 1.56 compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 viking photo. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,so if there where any objects on the ground like houses,shacks,planes,water,aircraft, or anything else you would of been able to see it. But in a way the aliens could of been tiring to send a messages to earth to let them know it was life there. But if they continue with the pixels, and to make bettter pixels they would be able to see even more every time.

There are a ton of things on earth that look like something but its not its just natural (it just happen). So something like that could of happened on mars, but it would be kind of strange for something to happen like that to happen on a planet where the is ''no life'. But everyone has there own opinion on what they think but we can only leave it up to the scientist to figure it out a regular person mostly likely can't only the pros. Us scientist will be able to figure it out today,tommorow,next month,or even years from now but hopefully one day we will find out. In my opinion I think we will with the technology we have and the things that will still be invented and be released one day.

So there is no way to really prove if aliens are real or fake. They are most likely fake, because they haven't tried to reach earth in any way. But if they did they would come in some type of aircraft. The aliens whole entire world would be shock and scared. No one would know what to do,because no one would even think something like that would happen in this current generation. But it could happen whenever most likely when its least expected.

But in some part of the world some, or alot of people are preparing for this are always waiting for this to happen. People should always be prepared for anything rain,sleet,snow,tornado, or anything evrything. But if the aliens never knew about life in earth, and they decided to send aircraft to like we did if they saw a rock with a alien looking thing on it they would react like we did. They would keep sending taking more pictures, however they would look at it they would get curious and try to make a trip to earth not knowing that there is actual life there.

But if earth did the same thing it would be a problem its taking a huge risk. When they would arrive and look around if they saw aliens they would panic. The aliens would be stronger then them most likely they probably wouldn't be making a trip to home. The aliens would some what react like a dinosaur if the NASA people didn't move (but they would) they would't get attack. But if they did move they would,so tiring to have NASA to go to mars is very risky for NASA and the astronauts. So they could make a better attempt by sending a drone and going around the whole planet,but the drone cant do everything that a human can. So if there is a cave or a door only a human would be able to search it the correct way, plus the drone could easily brake down or fail.",2,1,0.7437294721603394
19e8bd3,"Have you ever heard of the ""Unmasking the face on Mars"" before? Well people started making accusations before they got a high quality photograph. They though it was a face aliens had made on Mars, that was one of the many accusation made about the face on Mars.

The face on Mars is just a landmark because ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 98a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" So there as a big cloudy winter storm when people discovered the face. Well with all the wind blowing it could of just been made of dirt and rocks and everything blowed into one pile and by a cowincidence been made into a face.

Second another reason why the face is just a landmark because right after the winter storm they got ""A 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars."" Before they can go make accusations that go into history you have to have a high quaity picture to prove you are right. They got one picture and that is not enough to solve something in history to start making illogical accusations without evidence.

Finally why the face is just a landmark on mars is because instead of waiting to get a high quality image they waited 3 years to go back to Mars to see it. When they finally did go back to see the face they had a lot better and high quality cameras. So when they arrived back on Mars it was proven that the so called face was just a landmark. A quote in the text that makes everything logical is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West.""

So there you have it the face on Mars was just a landmark not an alien face.

See before everyone made illogical accusations they did not have a high quality photo and when they first took the photo when it was a cloudy day. NASA is correct because before making accusation they went and got evidence to prove their thoery's.            ",4,1,0.8236804008483887

People on earth see natural landforms that look like certian things all the time. Not to mention it looked like such a face because the shadows that it casted made it more detailed.

If it was aliens it would benefit us. Like the text states, ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars."" But its not. The text comes back afeterwards and says ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars."" If it was an ancient alien statue we would say it and back it up, because it would have a highly strong benefit towards NASA because we could get donations for it. Along with more popularity.

Not only would it benefit us, but it looks like natural landforms all across the world. The text even states, """"It reminds me most ofMiddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."""" Not only that but it mentions, """"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the face on mars.""""

Why not ask questions about landforms that look detailed or look like aliens may have done it on earth?

The main reason the face looked the way that it did was because of the shadows that it casted. The text tells us, ""Shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The text also tells us, ""Because of its face like structure it become a great attraction. Starring in films, books, magazines and other articles."" If it weren't for the shaddows then what was the point.

What if NASA is lying? What if none of this is true? WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BELIEVE US? People should believe NASA because again this all would benefit NASA. The text even states, ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars."" Not to mention, if it was a sign of human life it would show a dramatic increase of popularity.

So no it isn't an alien statue, or a sign of ancient alien civilization. If it was we would tell you so we could have a benefit or major profit. On Earth we have natural landforms all around that look like actual things made by aliens. Why not question them about those natural landforms? Not only that, the only real reason it looked like a face was because the shadows it casted made it look like it had a mouth, eyes, nose, and other facial features.

1a19cfb,"Although many people believe that the photo of a "" Human Face"" taken by NASA's Viking 1 from 1976 is created by aliens , many scientists prove it to be wrong. Considering how land can form in many shapes and sizes , it's not impossible for a landmass to looklike a face. It's also not impossible for aliens to build it but the fact that NASA have never discovered aliens prove that it cannot be credit to aliens, atleast not yet. Light also made it looklike a face and hide some parts with shadows thus making us blind to the other half. Another prove is that if we view it closer, it's nothing like a face but just an illusion. Therefore proving that aliens should not be credit of creating it.

Landmasses can have a variety of results. On Earth there are many landmasses ranging from high mountains to blue seas to dry lands and each of them have different types of appeareance. There are also many islands on Earth that shaped like a heart or other shapes. Even on Earth, there are many artifacts that are thought to be made by aliens. Why? Because they were ahead of their time but as soon as humen start accepting them, they were considered inventions. Knowing this fact, it's pretty clear that there will be more unique shapes and unknown tools to be discover on the Red Planet. We just have to take our time and use it as our advantage.

Light also tricked our brains into believing that it was a face. Light can cause many illusions and it's strongest with shadows. We humen use light to make shadows of dogs and rabbits using our hands and the result seems like a dog's or rabbit's shadow. The shadows hide the other half of the face and thus the other half might just be a plain of nothing on it. We only use our naked eyes to judge it when we should use the measurements to determine if it really could be a face or just a landmass.

Then in 2001, NASA took another picture of the ""Human Face"" and with better and higher technologies, the face was re-discovered with small details. The camara from 1976 did not provide enough evidences and it's not clear enough for our naked eyes to see the small details like the strings and the land features. The land features prove that the other half was nothing like what we imagined. Only half is like a face and the other half is just land with no features of a human face. The picture from 2001 reveals that, what was thought to be a face made by aliens for decades, is just illusion made by landmass and light.

Many people still and will still believe that it was made by aliens because they are in denial. Although aliens existing has always made humen curious about the lifeform of other planets, the face is just leading us into a wrong direction. We need to focus more on discovering more planets beyond our reach and also see if there is water source available on them. We should not let little landmass trick us into wasting millions and millions of dollars on it. But what ever the cause may be, nature will always surprise us and we just have to be ready for it.",4,1,0.8203829526901245
1a229bc,"I must say that, in my opinion The Face on Mars is indeed NOT created by aliens. It is simply illogical. And, to prove my point, I have conjured a few reasons as to why this ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform.

Firstly, the picture taken in 2001 is solid proof, as well as the 1998 picture. Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked.

Also, I will point out that, in 1976, we at NASA were still relatively new to venturing beyond Earth's orbit. The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was.

My final claim that the Face on Mars is a mesa lies in the fact that, if the Face really was an alien monument, NASA would not keep their lips tight about it. It would make global headlines, and shock the world. I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed ""aliens"" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.

Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens.

1a30445,"The face of mars has been intresting photo taken in the 1976 times. This specific picture has been causing a stir amoungst theorists and people for over 20 years. It seemed as though the face was to ressemble a human face. NASA has thought this could mean alien life on mars.

The picture taken in 1976 caused the stir in social networking. It was taken in low resolution but at the same time it was a high resolution in it's time of the late 1900's. The reason why this was so intresting to the people, was that you wouldn't see a face on a natural structure. However, some people thought it was just some structure that was natural in its own shape or form comparing it to other natural structures we have on our planet.

The spacecrafts returned back and returned with the photos taken on mars. It seemed now that NASA wanted to take priority of going to Cydonia which was another red planet far away. This was because they had observed the face theorizing that it was facing directly toward this red planet. When the news stirred, NASA had needed to come back to mars to take a better glimpse of the photo 20 years later with a better camera. It seemed when they had come back to mars that the face was no longer alien but some kind of volcanic crator. Some believe that it was just a natural structure that was made in some way or form and others still believed that this was still alien.

Theorists believed multiple reasonings as to why ",2,1,0.8581844568252563

Some people may think that aliens planted or made this mysterious face on Mars. If aliens made the face they would have tracings of something odd on the face. In paragrpah 12 its tells you how the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is landforms around the American West. The face on mars is about the same height as the lava dome that takes up a form of an isolated mesa. The pictures in the beginning of the passage you can see that in 1976 the object looked like a face, but in 2001 the object looks like broken down sand.

Next, the scientist does not have proof that it could be any signs of aliens surviving on Mars. In paragraph 7 it say that thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site , reavealing a natural landform. Also in paragraph 3 it pronounced that the face was a huge rock formation. Which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes , noes, and mouth (3).

This face became into something huge. It has become a pop icon, starred in a Hollywood film, apperead in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and grocery lines. This face on mars was just put into the public to have attention drawn to NASA.

In conclusion, their were no aliens on Mars planting faces because, the face on Mars was just a benefit to Nasa, there was not any proof or sign of aliens on Mars, and it looked equivalent to a butte or mesa. Most people know that their were not any aliens on Mars because their was not any proof. One day researchers might find traces of aliens!   ",3,1,0.911568284034729

If aliens were to create The Face, the imaging cameras would have captured someone either building The Face or being around The Face. Also, if these so called ""aliens"" were The ones who made The Face, why would they make The Face resemble a human being's face.

One suggestion that The Face was not made by aliens is that the Viking 1, the Mars Global surveyor, and the MGS did not capture any type of creature around or on The Face. Another suggestion would be that weather conditions and erosion might have been a factor in the creation of The Face. One more suggestion is that if the Face was created by aliens, the condition of The Face would have been the same from 1976 to 2001. Lastly, if The Face was crerated by aliens, would there be a city or village near The Face so the aliens could maintain the condition of The Face? Also, why would these aliens make the Face resemble a human being? Wouldn't they want the Face to resemble their own kind? Or are they trying to make contact with us by making the Face resemble a human being? There are some reasons why the Face is a natural landmark instead of a man-made, or in this case, an alien-made landmark.

The Face of Mars is a natural landmark instead of an alien-made landmark. One factor of the Face's creation on Mars is that the weather conditions and erosion played a role in its creation.

First, the so called ¨face¨ is just an illusion. It says so in the article. ¨...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth,¨ is what the article said. So the face is just a trick of the eye. Those sneaky scienetists.

NASA thought this illusion would bring Mars some attention. Which it did. That´s my next point. NASA relased this ¨face¨ picture so it would give some attention to NASA and Mars. If this face was made by aliens, I don´t think that the government would relase that information. Just a thought.

Finally, this land from is similar to those in the Western part of the US. That right there proves everything. Earth was all volcanos at one point. So naturally, it´s going to leave behind some unsual landfroms. Those unsual landfroms look exactly like the one on Mars. It can´t be aliens when something like that could form naturally.

This is completely false claim that has no evidence or support to be supported with. This mesa is a common natural landform that can be found commonly around. This is a mesa that happens to look like a face. Although it can look pretty convincing and decieving, it's something common. Like mountains on Earth, it's something that triggers your brain claiming it to be something it isn't. It's like seeing a shadow pass by the corner of your eye! You claim you saw it, but it was just a fragment of your imagination. It's something our brains trigger.

As it states in the article, praragraph two and three, it states that the face the public saw was just an illusion forming eyes, a mouth, and a nose. ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived.

This sentence supports the claim that the face was a simple fargemnt of the brain creating an illusion of something. It's a common landform that naturally is created. Although many theorist's claim that it had to do something with aliens and extraterrestrials, there is no evidence to support or back up that claim. Where else have you seen something out of the normal on Mars? Where there any prints or traces leading to something else? People just need to understand that it's was a landform and a landform only.

The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.""

Introduction:

[The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was formed over the years. It could of been made by an alien, but that is so unreal.]

The Face on Mars was common around Cydonia, but the only thing is this face had a unusal shadow which made the face look like a Egytian Pharaoh. Over the years that have passed the Face has become more like a rock shape then a actual face. The face look like a rock that resemble a human head in some sort.

We really don't know what made the face or how the face was formed. The face was ""formed by the shadows that create a illusion of eyes nose and mouth"". - Unmasking the Face of Mars

Also over the years the face has become more of a pop icon that was for most popular stuff. Honestly how could the face be created by an alien when it was such in human formed, but the over the years change rock like. The Face has been compare to some of the Earth natural landfrom. It look like Snake River Plain of Idaho. I think that the face is an artifact that was formed over years ago from its natural landform and hasn't been seen into now.",2,1,0.8499248027801514
1af678f,"There has been much debate over ""the Face"" on Mars; is just a natural landform or a objest that was created by aliens. But, the fact is that, if you look at the evidence, it easily proves that ""the Face"" is just an over shadowed landform.

One major pieces of evidence that proves this is not and alien creation. We figured out that this was just another Matian mesa, it seems to be common around the Cydonia area, but this one has shadows that makes it look like an human. And even these land form can be found around the American West. Even Garvin said it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. So the same thing happened with Mars. These fact basiclly prove the whole point that there was no aliens that build this face, and every you believed was false.

In conclusion, this is just a false idea that you were made to believe. And the fact that is no life on Mars, this will always be true unless we discover something. The Face on Mars will be known as a "" signal from the deep space"" but in reality it will never be. Just gives another reason for people to believe in aliens.",2,1,0.9299826622009277
1b3b11e,"The face on Mars is it a alien message or a natural landform.

I would say it is a landform. Why I will give several reasons why I think it is a landform latter in the argumentative essay i will be typing for Istep.

One reason I think it is a landform is how in the world could aliens bulid such a good looking face that looks a lot like a real human. I don't get how would the even know what a human even looks like. If they had some sort of device the going around Earth taking pictures of us would NASA already know about it or the National Goverment.

My second reason why the face on Mars is a natursl landorm. Is how could the make it when it is made out of rock. Did they go find a rock and start just carving a human face into it, NO you want to know why because things like that on Mars can't be used, Why because if they could be NASA would have traveled to Mars by now. PLus how would they move heavy equipment to mve the rock with out NASA seeing it, we have several microscopes going around different places of Space looking at different plants and such. So how could they not have seen that.

And for my thrid reason why the face on Mars is a natural landform. The text stats that their was no sigh of alien sighs or symbols the made us think that the aliens made this creppy looking face. BUt people say sense the 1998 trip to Mars was very cloudy when they toke the picture of the face. So they had to go back for a third time in 2001 a final prove that it is a natural landform and that is what they did. They shot a amazing photo that provide that there was no alien sighs or symbols by the face or around it.

The 3 reasons I gave you today are reasons why this face is a natural landform not any anilen made thing. That would be creepy and not right in my eyes. And maybe other peoples eyes. But to some people they think this is a alien made face which makes them crazy because it is definently a natural landform made form high winds and strong storms.",3,1,0.8807270526885986
1b734d9,"The image is just a landform and it was not created by aliens. It is a rock that was a natural landform on mars.

It was just another Martian mesa, it had unusaual shadows in it to make it look like a face. It says in paragraph 3 ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It is just a natural landform on mars that makes it look like a face because of the shadows.

25 years ago there was pictures being took on mars and it seemed to look like a face and some people thought it was aliens that made that landform on the planet mars. It says in paragraph 7 ""Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) teamed snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos."" There wasn't any alien monument when they went and flew over it.

Some people still didn't believe that it was just a natural landfrom. In 2001 they took a picture and a digital image 3 times the bigger than the pixel size so you could see if there was something there. It says in paragraph 11 ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Anything on that picture you could've seen but there was only the landform there.

There wasn't no alien sign there it was only a landform that was on mars that had shadows that made it look like a face on mars.",3,1,0.905406653881073
1b7e42c,"Alien Landform?

Do you think that the face on Mars is real or was created by an alien? As being a scientist, I dont think the face is real because Mars is not a living planet. Many of the planets in the solar system have different types of landforms in general. There is alot of evidence on how it could be many things and how it could have been made. Down below will be some evidence on how I think that the face on Mars is not real.

First, in paragraph two it said that the ""Face"" looks like a human face. ""An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Carpet Planet called Cydonia."" This could have meant that the camera was just put where the ""Face"" may have been looking at directly. there are many ways how this could just be a huge rock at a certain angle being a ""Face"".

Secondly, in paragraph 7 it states another thing about the type of landform. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . .a natural landform."" This states that there was no alien monument after all. That was another thing about how the ""face"" could have been a natural landform like how any other planet has.

Next, we all know how many people read magazines and watch movies. In paragraph 5 it states that the ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. 'It has started in a Hollywood film, apperared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" The defenders of the NASA budget wsh there was an ancient civilization on Mars. People were saying that NASA was trying to cover something up. Maybe some people dont think that its true so and that they need more information to let people know after they have found alot of information.

Now, their is a possibility that there is aliens on Mars. In paragraph 8 it claims, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face but perhaps they were alien markings that werre hidden by haze. ""It could have just been the camera that was not capturing them right. it also states how they dont pass over the face very often as in they are thinking that the ""Face"" might move like aliens. But, there is not enough evidence that this is a natural landform or an alien face. It even states how it could even be a lava dome that took form on the isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars that was on another planet.

In conclusion, I don't think that the aliens are real. I won't think that until they have an extradanary amount of evidence stating that is is a face. NASA has made alot of mistakes in the past and maybe this is one of those mistakes.             ",1,1,0.9142477512359619

I would disagree because aliens are not real and why would they just made a radom face into the ground. I would say that the land in that area is just deformed. I think that it is just Mother Nature, she put it like that, that spot is a natural landform.

People might think that aiens are real but that saying is just a myth that some people that are nerds will belive. I use to think they were real and then I figured out they weren't. If they was real then when people or NASA went to a planet or just into space, why didn't those people every see them? If they did exist why wouldn't people take pictures when they were in space of the aliens? Why don't aliens exist?

If aliens do exist do you think they would attack you if they saw you? I would think that aliens would be on earth. What would aliens be like if they were on earth? would the Earth still be the same if they was on Earth. Who would controll them if the did exist.

They chose to believe what an magazine article, hollywood films, books, and radio talk shows knew what is was that they were talking about. They believe it ws a face from someone who had once been on Mars. They believe in multiple things but in fact do not have valuable information, or proven facts.

On the other hand, scientists think that the face was not brought by aliens but in fact just a rock formation. They fortunately do have more valuable facts and information. NASA has been able to prove that the face was indeed not brought from aliens but, ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West."" They have porven that it is just a natural landform. How? Taken from the text it says,"" the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" - whcih are landforms common around the American West.

1bbd259,"Is There Really a Face on Mars???

The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).

When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.

Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).

Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken. Also the conditions were different so it was hard to get a good, clear shot. Believing some conspiracy theorist isn't always the best choice due to the lack of evidence that is provided to support the claim.  ",3,1,0.8479677438735962
1bd5edc,"The Natural Landform on the Unatural Planet

Seeing something that you can't really tell what it is is frustrating, right? NASA and conspiracy theorists totally know what you are going through. NASA found a

""Face on Mars"" and now everyone thinks it has something to do with aliens. Well, they are very wrong. NASA would have benefitted from the ""Face of Mars"" if aliens had anything to do with it, NASA took a picture on April 5, 1998 snapping a higher resolution picture, and on April 8, 2001, they took a picture at the sharpest point on a cloudless summer day, proving for the second time that it was just a landform. The skeptics may have their points on to why it may be created by aliens, but NASA has three amazing photos to prove them wrong. The Face on Mars is not really a face after all.

To begin, NASA's budget would have benefitted a lot if the landform had anything to do with aliens at all, so why would they want to keep it a secret if it were true? First things first, When NASA revealed the photo of the huge landformation it became a huge hit! They were hoping to catch the attention of Mars to the public, and boy oh boy, they did just that. It starred in a Hollywood movie, appeared in magazines, books, radio talkshows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Unfortunately, the positive popularity always comes with the negative. Some conspiracy theorists thought that the Face was bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide. Defenders of NASA's budget can only wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

Secondly, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, the section on Mars where ""The Face"" lives, snapped a picture of it ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture proves again that the face is just a landform. The conspiracy theorists and people that supported their opinion were still not happy with the results. They said in paragraph 8, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" I don't know how they get these crazy assumptions, but they will just never give up! They went all the way back to take a second picture to prove they're wrong, don't you think that shows that nothing about this landform is alien infested, or was created by them?

Last, but not least, They took a second picture of ""The Face"" at the highest resolution possible to prove to the opposing side again. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin proved the correct point for everyone, hopefully having everyone believing that ""The Face"" is not a face, just a lava dome.

On the other hand, the other side had a bit of detail to help support their side as well. Their first assumption was that in the second photo, wispy clouds covered any alien like markings. To prove that wrong NASA took another photo at the highest resolution to prove that it is just a natural landform on Mars that has nothing to do with aliens. The skeptics will probably never give up on how this was made by aliens, but NASA has three extraordinary photos to prove them wrong every single time.

In conclusion, ""The Face"" is just a natural landform. NASA would have benefitted from the ""Face of Mars"" if aliens had anything to do with it, NASA took a picture on April 5, 1998 snapping a higher resolution picture, and on April 8, 2001, they took a picture at the sharpest point on a cloudless summer day, proving for the second time that it was just a landform. The skeptics can try to find every way to show that aliens had something to do with it, but they don't have three pictures of the landform itself. Real facts beat assumptions every time.

Aliens has been a man's fantasy forever. Do we know that that aliens really do exist? Ever since the first man on the moon, sciencists have been working to prove that aliens exist. We barely have enough evidence to even prove ourselves. Do we humans have enough evidence that shows aliens are real?

No, we dont have enough evidence that shows aliens are real. Maybe one one day we may or may not find an alien race on a farway planet. Until then, we just have to more evidence that proves it. Who knows, maybe aliens did created the Face on Mars? My conclusion is that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.",3,1,0.8736078143119812
1c8ac21,"Hello, my name is Hannah. I am a scientist at NASA who has been studying the ""face"" on Mars over the years. Today my close friend Mason had asked me about any imformation I've found out recently. I said,""Well, it just appears to be a natural formation rather than something that was created."" He argued and argued over how the aliens built it,and how its just been hidden all these years.

In a shorter explaination I told Mason that the shadows show how they do on Earth on natural formations. He didn't quite get it so I showed him a messa and how they shadow. He still thought the marsians made the formation of the face.

The next day, he talked to me about the same thing. Only this time I knew that I could prove to him that the ""face"" was only natural. I pulled up the pictures taken over the years and let Mason examine them very carefully. The picture taken in 2001 shows that there is nothing else around the face. If there was anyhting on the ground such as an airplane or a shack, you have been able to tell what it was. But there was nothing. Mason still didn't agree that the form on Mars was a natural landform.

It was now the third day he has argued over the face on Mars. But this day, Mason didnt argue with me. He asked to see the pictures again, along with pictures of a messa and a butte, which are natural landforms here on Earth. Mason looked for hours and hours and hours. He finally spoke up,""Maybe you guys here at NASA are right.. It seems to be completely natural.."" I replied,""I told you old pal. Next time you should look into something more before you argue about it.""

The next morning Mason came to work with me. The other scientists and I all came agreed that the face on Mars was completely natural. Not only did NASA finally figure out how to ""unmask the face"" and call it a natural landform, but they also provided a lot of information that way people understood it better. To this day the ""face"" is known to be a natural landform!",3,1,0.8164554834365845
1c8b117,"Many people have different opinions about what happens on the planet Mars. During a recent discovery many people had the idea that the face on mars was created by aliens. Scientists had a different theory. Scientists believed that the face was formed by something more believable. Aliens was not one of those.

On May 24th NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was on Mars. The spacecraft was going about it's regular mission until it noticed something interesting. The text states, ""..when it spotted the shadowy likenss of a human face."" The text states, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see."" Once NASA revealed the images for the world to see, many of them claimed it was from aliens. Scientists had to quickly do their research to clear up false accusations. The text states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Once NASA cleared it up that it wasn't an alien monument they quickly found out what the face was. The text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West. NASA was able to put an end to the false accusations, and also support their conclusion with nautral landforms.

While many people do have different opinions about certain things, sometimes those opinions can chhange. By being able to provide people with evidence as to why something is the way it is can steer thier opinion in another direction. NASA had many followers who felt that the face on Mars was caused by aliens, but NASA was quick to provide them with correct imformation on the formation of the face.",3,1,0.8808936476707458

Also how would the aliens know what humans look like, they have never even been to earth before. All that face is, is a rock with shadows from the sun to make illusions to the human eye.

The face was used in grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Yes, you may think think aliens did it and there is a chance they did, but that chance is very slim. yes, some scientist did believe it was an alien artifact but that was before they had HD cameras and now we can see the rock clearly. Garvin said that ""If there were objects in that picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were"".

In conclusion, there is no evidence that aliens have created that face and if there was, NASA would do all that it could to prove it a farce. Do not believe everyhting you see online or in books. You might just become too attatched to that topic.",2,1,0.8080170154571533
1d50ef4,"On the Martian planet, a mesa is common in the region Cydonia. Which means that ""The Face"" is just a combination of rocks having a shadow that gives the apperence of a human face. The camera used in 1976 didnt have the sharpness of the cameras used in 1998 or in 2001. So, it would appear to be fuzzy and disoriented. As seen in the 2001 photo, ""The Face"" is just a mesa in the region Cydonia.

In 1976, when the Viking 1 was searching for possible landing sites, the spacecraft was not looking for any Martian ruins or ancient civilization on the planet. So the Viking 1 didnt have a high enough resolution camera to capture the true form of the landscape. When the MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) went to Mars in

April 5,1998, the camera had taken pictures ten times sharper than the original Viking 1 photos. When scientist observed the photos, they revealed a natural landform on Mars.

Neverless, people where not satisfied with the photos, claiming that around that time of the month it gets cloudy on Mars and the alien markings were coverd by a haze. So NASA decided to prove them wrong by sending another spacecraft to Mars. On April 8, 2001, using the MOC's absolute maximum resolution, they took a picture. Each pixel in the 2001 image is 1.56 meters per pixel rather than 43 meters per pixel in the Viking's photo.

1d580b3,"The Face? Created by Aliens or just a landmark?

Did you beieve that the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" was just created by aliens. NASA has given us many reasons to believe what they say, and not many reasons for us not believe them. I am a NASA researcher and I'm telling you why the ""Face"" is actually just a landmark.

There are many reasons why the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is a natural land form. The first reason is that NASA took three different pictures, one picture was in 1976 in the picture you can't really see anything. Scientists just thought it was another Matian mesa. At this time the cameras weren't very 3D like. So how do we know it's an actual face?

The seacond reason it is a landform is because NASA

sent another crew to take more pictures of the ""face."" The crew took ten pictures that were sharper than the first one in 1976. In this picture you start to see something appear. They even say ""when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. People were not very happy when they heard it wasn't a alien monument.

Another reason is that they thought alien markings were being hazed. So, when they went back it was a cloudless summer. In the text they say ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That is a huge difference from 1976. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.

If you really think about it though, how come they jumped to conclusions so fast? In the passage it says it would be a good way to engage the public to Mars. Wouldn't it just attract more people to NASA to though?

In many ways there are more reasons to why this ""Face"" is more of a landmark than anything. From the different years they took the years, to the landmarks being hazed. You could probably think of a lot of questions to ask NASA about the photos and what the scientists are saying, but until you go up to Mars we will only know what they are telling us. Which is that the ""face"" is a mesa. They clearly say many times in the passage for people to believe that they are not trying to trick you.  ",4,1,0.9004957675933838

1de153e,"In 1976 NASA captured a picture of Mars with the Viking 1. This photo was taken of a Martian mesa which resembled a human face. When this was shown to the public, people went crazy. People said that it was created by aliens, but others say it was

just a landform on Mars.

For my evidence that this photo is in fact a normal natural landfrom on Mars. We shall compare the dates these photos were taken. When Viking 1 first took the picture of the ""Face"" we weren't able to see all of the details. Remember at the time photography wasn't as superb as it was in 2001. In 1998 when MGS took the picture of the ""Face"" we were able to get a clearer product, but there were clouds in the way. If those clouds were not in the way we would have evidence it was a landform sooner. At the perfect time NASA was able to get a clear photo with better technology we were able to see the ""Face"" for what is really was.

At the time conspiracy theorist said that NASA was hiding the truth from the public saying that life on Mars did exist, but they were relunctant to show it. Even if they did find life on Mars it would be a huge scientific discovery. Why would we be forced to hide the truth from the people and not answer the biggest question in

history. Are We Alone. Just to add on, these conspiracy theorist did not have enough evidence to prove their claim either.

Now this ties in with my first claim of technology at the time. if you compare the photo from 1976 and 2001 you can see a major difference. Shading. In the Voyager 1's photo the lighting is not the best. Shadows in the photo make the illusion that there is a face in this rock. In MGS's photo there are features that are more defined than the 1976 photo.

Even though it would be amazing to have life this close to our planet. Mars is not just the right place for life. Sometimes we just have to accept reality. We may really be alone here in this huge universe. Maybe someday we will find aliens. Maybe not. The Face of Mars gave hope to some and brought them back down, but there will be a day when our visions of extraterrestrials will come true.           ",4,1,0.8776752948760986

1de8098,"There are three key reasons that NASA would not want to hidde the evidence or wouldn't want a ancient civilzation. One reason is that having a ancient civilzation would be a key thing to research. Another one is it would make the popularity and profits go up for NASA. The Third reason is that the face is two miles wide, and resembles a butte, from the camera's quality.

They wouldn't want to hide this civilzation, because they would have reasearch and more popularity. NASA's defenders say they wish there was a civilzation. The article stated this about the Nasa budget: ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an Ancient civilzation on Mars."" They want there to be one but that isn't what it is.

NASA would get more donations and profit if this was true. This means NASA wouldn't want to deny it if it even was true. The reasoning of the conspiracy theorists are wrong saying that they want to hide this evidence, because they don't. This would enable them to accomplish farther space study and more information about an extra terristral civilzation.

The camera they used in 2001 compared to 1977 had a way better camera. Also they stated in the article ""...on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"". This takes out the reasoning of the conspiracy theorists that their were clouds and shadows blocking the camera that made it appear as a butte in 2001 compared to when it looked like a face in 1977.

NASA has done extensive research on this topic and wished it was true. The facts prove it is not real, and how it would help NASA if it was.

Landforms like the Face are found very commonly, but not all landforms found are exactly like the Face. In the next paragraph I will give you some reasons why the Face wasn't formed by aliens.

The Face found on Mars was just a natural landform. In the passage it says, when Michael Malin took pictures 10 times sharper, with his Mars Orbiter Camera, the image revealed just a natural landform. If you take a look in paragraph 2 it states that mesa, or landforms, are commonly found around Mars. Also, the Face has equivalence to landforms found around the American West.

In the passage ""Unmasking the Face of Mars"" there are two major opinoins on if there once was a civilization on Mars or if it was a natural landform. Based on text and factual evidence I belive that the ""face"" on Mars is a natural land form.

First, ""on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" (10) ""Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoulotion."" (10) Which Means they got the best picure they could.

In addition, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digitial image 3 times bigger than you the pixel size. (11) ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see what they were!"" (11) This proves that if it was a civilization, then it would have other structure too, but it doesn't.

My last peice of evidence comes from (paragraph 12), ""The picture acutally shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa0landforms common around the American West."" ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" (12)

Finally, to oppose my argument the article also stated that, ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. (9) Some people are not satisfied with the results. They say,""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" (9)

Based on experts, text, and factual evidence I belive that the ""Face"" on Mars is a natural land form. I belive that the ""Face"" on Mars is just a natural landform because the author uses evidnce like how they went back on a clear day a took magnified-detailed photos and how things would have showed up if there were things living on Mars.

You will also see textual evidence for those reasons that we have. In this article we will be talking about "" The Face on Mars"". So here our the reasons for us to think it was created by aliens and for it not to be created by aliens.

I believe that the face n mars was not created by aliens. I believe that because of how the ""face"" has evolved. In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.

The ""Face on Mars"" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.

This article it also states that the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a mesa. Which proves that the so called ""face"" is not a face and it is just a landform.

Others still thought it was a face. Those people thought that because of what the article says in parargraph 11. In paragraph 11 it states that "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" So because of what they had said in that paragraph people believed that they had saw a face.

Those are the reasons for why people had thought that the ""Face on Mars"" was an actual face. Also the reasons why people thought that it was just a natural landform instead.      ",3,1,0.8809018731117249

It is stated in the fourth passage, that it is giving an illusion to the shadows and making it look like it has eyes, nose, and a mouth."" Evidence say in the fifth passage say that NASA would wather hide, and say that conspiracy theorists.

The monument has properties tht make it look like is has a natural human face. The shadows give it a 3D effect to look like a person from Earth. to eally see that it is not a face you will need to focuse on the picture, to not let the shadow make you think it is a face. The face is only a illusion of the mind, some people say the face looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh.

NASA thinks that if there were a alien civilization on Mars that it would be a popularity increase for the big red planet. People that still think that their was life on Mars defend by saying that it would help the budget for themselves. The Face on Mars became popular and started to get on talk show, radios, and magazines. Soon NASA wanted to let the conspircy take place and leave the Face alone.

The Face of Mars could have been made by alien because of the unexplainable things on Earth itself. In the last passage it states that i could have been made bye aliens. Compared to all of the things on Earth. It could be a possiblity of aliens making the Face on Mars. For example, in the last passage it says that Garvins say, ""That it slike the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on a Mars.""

NASA wanted to do a double-check so in 2001 they took some more pictures. Now the pictures came out more clear than the last picture in 1998. Then NASA proved once again that it was just a natural landform.

Those are the reasons why that it is a natural landform. It was proved twice and the pictures were accurate, 3 times better the vision the last time they took a photo. Even with all the evidence some still believe that it is an acient Egyptian pharoh face on Mars.      ",2,1,0.8526395559310913

Second, any person would know that NASA would rather have money than another secret. The discovery of alien life on Mars would be very rewarding in cash, and the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars(5). They want there to be an ancient civilization because it would mean tons of money for them.

Finally, science proves that theory to be completely wrong. There have been absolutely no signs of any life whatsoever on Mars(7). If there's no life to build it, how can it be built by life?

1f30de7,"Have have you ever wanted to learn more about something like about a person or maybe... a planet? This essay is on unmasking the face on Mars, is it real? or fake?

Well is is in fact real in here are the reasons why.

First, it is real because Twenty five years ago we spotted something weird happening on Mars. One of our spacecrafts, The Viking 1, was getting pictures of what may be possible land sites for its sister ship, The Viking 2. It was then that we noticed something strange, it was like a shadowy likeness of a human face. It had an ENORMOUS head nearly almost two miles end to end. it ALMOST looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, a few days later we unveiled the image for everyone to see...even though we were not sure how everyone would react. But to NASA's surpise, everyone loved it it was in movies, books,magazines etc. There were some people out there who didn't belive it, said it was probably fake and that we were just trying to scare people into thinking aliens were real. But it was real alright and we have the evidence to prove it.

Third, even though few scientists believed it to the Face of an alien artifact, the photos of Cydonia became important to NASA when the Global Surveyor (MGS) to the Mars in September. After 18 years, the Viking missions ended. Not every one was okay with though. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north latitude, it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of the year on Mars. We tried to take a look at it one more time but it was to late. When the cloudiness ended on mars we had put another spacecraft on Mars. when we got pictures back you could then all the detail and more on the face.

Even though some people may still not ever believe it, we just want them to just acknowledge the thought of '' What If?''. Then maybe they could see that this really is an anicent alien mark.  ",3,1,0.8039571642875671

For all we know it could just be a mountain that has ''eyes'', ''a mouth'', ''and a nose'' due to shadowing.

We human beings really have no clue if there are aliens or not, we find ''clues'' and believe there are but, in my opinion there are none.

Since than the ""Face"" became very popular it even has been in some Hollywood films.

I think that the ""Face"" is caused by the natural landform. Have you ever wonder why Mars is like Earth's twin or sisters well because they are alike. Earth has had natural landform just that in Mars it looks different but it doesn't mean nothing it's still a natural landform. Now I do understand why some people might say that it looks like it has been created by aliens cause it does look like a real face. The nose, eyes and mouth litterly looks like a real face of a person but just cause of that it doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

Now here is my true evidence that will convice people that the ""Face"" wasn't created by aliens. In 1976 was the first photo Viking 1 took. In 1998 another photo was taken later on in 2001 another photo was taken. If you see the pictures it is so obese that the ""Face"" on Mars is a natural landforming. In the pictures the ""Face"" looks like if it was changed over the years.",3,1,0.8966675996780396

On April 5, 1998 MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper. It just revealed it to be a natural landform.

After taking the picture they saw no alien monument. They decided to take another picture just to clarify. On April 8, 2001 Malin's team captured a picture using maximum resolution. Each pixel was 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel which is the best they could have done in that time. If there were any form of alien artifacts or anything like that we would have seen it. The picture actually shows a form of a butte or mesa. They are landforms Common around the American West.

They have done other research to try and prove that there is no alien activity. Why would they lie? Defenders of the NASA budget specifically said they wished there were an ancient civilization. Typically if someone has an opinion of something they try to fight the opposing side. So why would NASA lie if they weren't against what the American people had to say?

Scientist believe that rocks just so happened to form an object that looks like an human face, also they do not think that the alien theory is correct. Others think that alien life on mars is possible. Im going to tell you why the scientist are correct, and why the media is incorrect.

Scientist believe that this cannot be alien artwork because they are certian it is an Mesa they say these mesa's where very common alll around Cydonia. Also this was said to be form by multiple shadows giving away illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Fortunantly NASA got in the news, the paper, magazines, books, talk shows, and TV!

The media is incorrect becuase they aren't as able to go in a deep as the scientist can the media [people in america] can only use the resoures they as scientist has th right equipment to get the job done. Also if there was some kind of aliens they be very far we would have been able to see the aliens establishment.also there would be evidence baount movement if it was created by aliens they must've been strong to be able to haul all of those rocks. One more thing is education none os these people are just trained every day on how to use these machines it are lots and lots of hardwork and dedication. People have to go to college to get an degree on this very complicated work that is done by these specialy picked scientist.

So, in the end the scientist were scientificly right because there is lots of Mesa's around Cydonia. Also scientist got a little bit of and bebifit by being noticed in social media. The media were incorrect be cuase there was not alot of resoures the media could use unlike the scientist [or people that research at NASA] withc have all of the equipment they need to get the job done.

This shows that people are going against what scientist are saying and that people have opinons that this is just a natural landform, and that this was naturally formed on Mars.

Also, people have taken pictures of this landform with a camera that is ten times sharper than the Viking photos, stated in passage 7. After they took these pictures with this high tech camera it showed there was no alien monument. When this landform was made and the first photo was shown it formed a humans face, it didn't form an alien. In passage 3 it says, ""illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" of a human being.

If a alien were to make this landform they would probably make it of them, something that actually looks like them not some other creature, like a human. ""When the camera was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 it was cloudy on the Red Planet"". While they were searching they never seen Alien markings.

The following agrument is concluding whether to believe theory or research is most truthful in the scenario of the ""Face on Mars.""

Theory is false in many ways. It is based on an assumption or a belief that something irrelivant has happened. For example, believing in aliens or the Big Bang Theory is quite inaccurate. We have no proof of their existance or records of their happenings. Some believe ""The face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.""

2107730,"Mar's Face

Many people think that Mars has life living on it. One example would be the two mile long landform, the Face. People have been wondering for years what this odd shaped landform is, could it be an alien statue or just a natural landform. The Face is not an alien formation, but a natural landform.

When NASA sent Viking 1, in 1976, to photograph Mars. They took images of the landscape there and stumbled upon a newly forming mesa or butte. Once NASA brought the images back and analyzed them. They found that the Face was nothing more than a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that made it look like a face.

Then, in 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the region again. They snapped several pictures of it, at a ten times higher resolution, I might add, and analyzed these new images. They finally put their images on the internet and revealed to the world, that the Face was nothing more than a natural landform.

Finally, in 2001, NASA sent Mars Global Surveyor a second time to photograph the Face. The team at NASA used the highest possible resolution to photograph this controversial piece of Mars. They found that the picture shows the, ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,"" which are are also found in the American West. NASA's chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program says,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

Some people think that the Face provides evidence for life on Mars becasue NASA could not get a good shot of it. They do have a point that it would be hard to get a clear image of the Face with challenging weather. Yet, NASA has proven over and over again that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation.

The Face is nothing more than a natural landform and not an alien formation. Scientists found that is was a Martian mesa but the unusual shadows made it look like a face. NASA also found that it was nothing more than a natural landform and the Face looks very similar to buttes or mesas here on earth. Others think that NASA could not have gotten good pictures because of the weather, but NASA has proven that the Face is just a natural landform. The Face is just a strange piece of Mars and not a symbol of alien history.   ",4,1,0.8704866170883179

The scientists that work with NASA, such as myself, have found many different reasons as to why the formation looks like a face. During our time photographing Mars, we have been equiped with much better quality cameras, which help us see things better on Mars itself. Over the years, we have discovered that when you use a higher quality Mars Global surveyer (MGS), the "" face "" no longer looks like a face. Still some people didn't believe us the first time we got photographs of the land mark, so went and did it again. This time, we made sure that there weren't any clouds that could default the photos of Mars. What we found out by looking at these photos is the the facial features are simply just shadows. Take the eyes for example, while photographed from the middle of the land mark, there is a shadow being created by the sun. From this angle, the sun makes the land mark seem as if it had eyes. The "" mouth "" is simply just a hole in the land mark, which looks like a mouth while photographed from the middle of the land mark. There is no way aliens could be the cause of a natural piece of land on Mars.

Now that you understand what the "" Face "" actually is, I hope you dont still think aliens were the cause of it. There is scientific proof that it is a natural piece of land that just so happened to form on Mars.   ",3,1,0.8887130618095398

Is it still possible for there to be aliens on the planet, maybe. We could go back to the planet and see if there is any evidence of alien life forms now.

The face on Mars is formed from wind blowing dirt and sand around, pileing it up and packing it together. Now it just so happened that it managed to form a face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Now is this a strnge thing to have happen, yes it is indeed but it still happened all on its own. If we were to go and look at the photots you would see that there are no footprints or anything aroun the face, there is just the face.

Brynna states from paragraph 5,"" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA

If you carefully read the article you see that NASA says they think an alien might have made it. They said ""might"", so they don't really know if it was created by an alien.

The head is nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This head formation is just a natural landform on Mars. On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists.

The face on Mars is a natural land form. The article states that, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" This shows that pictures would be taken to prove that the landform is indeed a natrual landform. The text also states that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the face first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This peice of text shows proves that with the pictures, the head is a natural landform. These text peices show that the face is a natural landform on Mars.

The land formation on Mars is was not created by aliens. The article states that, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

These text peices show that the pictures would have caught any signs of alien incounters so these prove that the natrual landform on Mars was not created by aliens.

Some say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, ""But not everyone was satisfied.

223b86d,"The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. Through advancements in digital imagery, an understanding of shadows, and an understanding that there is no alien life evidence, it can be concluded that the face on mars is just a myth.

Today, we humans have the access to cameras with spectacular resolution. When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.

Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This excerpt from the article explains that the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.

While many conspiracy theorists would still like to believe that aliens created this face on the moon, they are mistaken. With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found. However, others still argue.

Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct. However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms. The article mentions, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars."" This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information.

So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.

22507ef,"I am a scientist at NASA. I am argueing with someone who thinks that the face on Mars was created by aliens. I will provide simple facts that everyone will be able to understand and hopefully help you see that the face on Mars is nothing but a landfom created by natural causes.

When the first picyure of the ""Face"" came out on the Viking 1, the small indents and the shadow angle showed what looked like a human face but was actually just one of the many mounds that for there. The United Staes actually has mounds of lava that had formed NATURALY in Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Many people believe that if it is used for advortizement that is is a real true fact and they can believe that what ever is on that buildboard or sign on the highway that has had or is going to happen. The Face of Mars has been used for marketing for over 25 years so it would sell more item to the population and the buisness CEO's would make more money.

People also believe in one picture on a cloudy day that they could see markings on the mound that would show that Martians have been and built the Face, but on a cloudlaess summer day in 2001 we captured a picture of the mound with our new and improved cameras that spans 1.5 meters compared to the 43 meter camera that the Viking used. The newer camera can discren things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,so we could see if there was anything on the mound that would show living things on the planet Mars",2,1,0.8897064328193665
22ba497,"After reading the article ""Unmasked the Face of Mars"" I believe that these are just natural formed lanforms. One reason is because this face has many similar characteristics to landforms found in the west. Secondly, because the the pciture only show a natural land form after all. Lastly becuase because we have no affical proof that this was once a alien civilization.

One reason I believe that this is simply a natrual landform because of the many simularities it has with many of the landfroms in the west. In paragraph (12) it states that ""What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalnt of a butte or mesa land forms common arounf the American west. Also it states in the same paragraph that "" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars.""

Another reason that this text has caused me to belive that all the face is , is natural landform because when many people obeserved tha photo many belived that is was a natrual landform after all. In paragraph (7) "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for when the image first appeared on JPLweb sie revealing ....... a natural lanform. There was no signifigance of an alien mounument after all. Also earlier in the article in paragrph (2) it state that ""Sientists figured it was another martian mesa, common enough around Cyndonia. Only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh.

The third and finale reason why I believe that this is just a natural land form is beause NASA has simply no proof that this could possibly that there could have been once a alien civilization one Mars (Cydonia). In paragraph ( 2 ) ""Scientists figured out that is was only a common martian mesa, it was only the unusal shadow to make it look like a Egyptian Pharoh. Also on paragraphs (10) though(12) it states that the weather was clear and all they had found was that they had no signifagance to proof of an alien civilization on mars only to have simular characteristics of natural landforms quiet like the ones on earth.

On the other hand maybe its not a natural landform maybe some people may be right it could be some type of alien landform.

NASA could have done somthing to the pictures to mess with the hopefulls. In paragraph (8) states that "" The camera on board the MGS had to peer through the whispy coulds to see that face. Perhaps, siad skeptics , alien markings were hidden by haze. But this has no relevance because on there clear weather second attempt of getting a photo , they figured out i was just a natural landform becuase of the fact that in this photo it clearly dipicked that it had many of the same characteristics of natural landforms in the American west. This proves even though that that could have been a civilization it shows that it was only a landform.

In conclusion, all the Face of Mars is a natural landform because they didnt have any proof that this was an alien civilization. It had many of the same characteristics of many natural landforms in the American West and that it much of the research they had still proved that it was a natural landfrom because of there findings.

22dd848,"Different people can have many different opinions on weather or not the ""Face on Mars"" was made by aliens or not. There are many reasons for my it might have been made by aliens. There are also many reaons for why it is just a natural landform that formed on Mars. It seems more likely that the face was not made by aliens, but formed naturally. Now here are just a few of the many reasons for why ""The Face on Mars"" is a natural landform.

The first reason for why aliens did not form the ""face"" is becuase aliens have not been proven to live on Mars. Which would make it impossible for them to have formed it. The second reaon is that life has not been proven to exsist on Mars, so it would have to be formed naturally. Finally, there are many landforms that are on Earth and may look like something else, and was naturally formed and not man made. For example, a cave in Tennessee has a lot of rock formations that look like bacon, a sun set, and even a frog. Those are just a few reasons for why the face on Mars was not made by aliens, but was naturally formed by nature.

The face on Mars has many differnt opinions for weather it was made by aliens or was naturally formed by nature. There are reasons for why either one of them could be proven correct. As you can now tell it is very unlikely that the face was made by aliens. Instead it was formed naturally by nature. Now you know why it is very unlikely that aliens made ""The Face on Mars.""",3,1,0.8545855283737183
22f55dc,"This is from the NASA facility er do not have fool proof on what made the crator in mars we don't have full evidence on what happend on mars. The face on mars is a mystery and very intersting phnominon and leads to very meracisly things in the future but for futher notice we cant say it was aliens. NASA scientist dont believe that this was alien trying to send a signal or a message to us for all we know a astroid may hit mars and we didnt know.

On the flip side people and scientis have belived and wondered if aliens are real and there is many cases to make people believe there are alien living amungst human along with movies, games, and toys. We are all fasinated by space and still think aliens are real and some think that aliens are not real.

We may never know what amde the face on mars if it was aliens or just rocks making shadows and if we ever find out why there was a face it will be a sight to see in the near future.     ",1,1,0.8063442707061768
22fa8b0,"Some people think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, which is anaccurate. Mars obviously has alot of natural disasters on its planet almost daily. These natural disasters could've made the surface into a face like shape by how much damage was caused to the enviroment. Mars is full of red bolders that could of been tossed around by the storms and left marks or craters in the surface. I have a little more detail to my theory.

First, there is no sign of alien life on Mars. I'm not saying there's no sign of life on Mars period, there is sign of water being on that planet and possibaly plants as well. It's just that there is no sign of a species on that planet, not even fossils of the so called ""aliens"". If there was any aliens on Mars what material would they have to make any form in the ground. Aliens probably wont have any exsplosives on their planet with no material to make it with.

Next, if there were any aliens why would they make a face on the ground. It has no meaning to it, it might just be a ruler/king or something to their people. I dont think aliens would want to put a face on the ground that barely looks like a face. The enviroment made the form because the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho was made by our enviroment, so it can be a caquensadence. That's a compairason that leads me to believe the enviroment of Mars made that face on the surface.

Then, there are scientific facts and quotes from NASA that supports lots of evidence. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter revealed that the Face was a natural landform. And added that ""there was no alien monument after all."". The team snapped ten photos of the lanform that was sharper then the first camera of Viking 1. This team gives more evidence than the conspiracy theories by the public.

In conclusion, I think that my theory is both accurate and logical. I took edvice from people who did their research on this topic. The evidence that i took were both believable and not crazy theories from ordinary citizens. These are my reasonings on why i think that the Face was made by Mars enviroment.

2324a33,"First,there has never been any realistic shows of life on Mars. Nobody has ever seen an alien before. Also there has been a lot of ""alien sightings"" all around the world that were just modern day things. Like a towel rack,a plate,a light,a lawn mower,or even a box of cereal. The eyes can deceive in some areas and make you think you see something when you really don't.

Some landforms are formed by the planet itself. As it states in paragraph 7,""Thousands of axious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web sit,revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Proving that the Face was just a natural landform on the planet Mars and not some kind of ""alien monument"". Sometimes the eyes can deceive you to make you think your looking at something your really not looking at. Those were one of those times.

Not only did that hurt NASA's reputation,it educated others on how there isn't life on Mars and there probably will never be life on Mars. It also tought NASA a lesson to gather more information and make sure that they know what they are doing, and what they are really investigating before they reach anything out to the public. Nevertheless ,in my opinion and based on the facts I've read. I don't believe that there is life on Mars.",2,1,0.8101599812507629
2336577,"First off, we can not say it was an alien who creater these human-like faces. We can't prove it was an alien at this time, because we haven't even figured out if aliens even exist! It most likey was a nautural landform, because over time, rock formation could've combined all together to create this face-like figure on mars.

Next, this is obviously a landform, and not created by aliens, because, during those cases, there was no alien monument after all! Also, on April 5, 1998, thousands of web users were anxiously waiting for the very first image on a JPL web site, which seemed to reveal that it was actually a natural landform.

Next, not everyone was happy with the results of it being a natural landform and not created by a alien. The ""face on Mars"" became such a big deal, it was in films, magazines, books, radio shows, and most likely your checkout line at your local grocery store!

Fourth, many people were wondering why NASA didn't just hide the discoveries of the life on Mars. Conspiracy theorists say ""life on Mars"", evidence that NASA workers would have rather hide to prevent too many questions on the face.

To conclude, maybe it was all just a huge rock formation, since aliens have no evidence that they actuslly exist, or have been seen by a human. So what do you think? Do you think aliens may have created this landform, or was it just a natural lanform?",3,1,0.9080803990364075

236bdd3,"Some people changed their views on the planet Mars in May, 2001 do you know why? Twenty five years ago NASA used their Viking 1 spacecraft to find a landing spot on Mars but, they found much more. Some people might think its aliens who made this forgein face figure on Mars, much like my family friend OTHER_PII. He believes that aliens live on mars but as a scientist at NASA I know there is no aliens on Mars and this is some natural cause. Here is what NASA's scientist have found out about this face like on Mars.

OTHER_PII told me ""There are aliens on this planet."" I know this is a natural cause for this face to appear like this. This is why im trying pursade him and tell him its ""actually Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"". These landforms are commonly found in the American West. This one in pericular reminds Garvin ""Of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

NASA has seen this kind of landform appear on Mars before. On April 8, 2001 with no clouds in the area Mars Global Surveyor got us a sencond look. OTHER_PII still thinks it is made from aliens though. Average for NASA's spacecrafts can go up to 43 meters, but this pixel went up to 1.56 meters. Many people still think this is alien made and we want to get as many as people we can to know the truth.

Some people might think different like OTHER_PII he states "" How can this possibly be a landform like on earth but there is no earth like subtances on Mars?"" He points out that other people think this way too. The picture was in magenizes and on posters in stores. Everyone got a good look at it and all of us think that it is becuase of aliens. How can a natural think on a planet make such a thing as a face. Others also might think that the photo was edited because they ddint see it in person but, OTHER_PII believes it is work of aliens.

OTHER_PII and the other people that think this about the Face on Mars is because aliens are incorrect. NASA has the facts and the oringal picture.This is for sure a landform made naturally and looks like a face. Every simple in the fact that this landform is not alien made. ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is just zooming up on the spacecraft and this is not made by aliens.

Reseach at NASA shows that this in not in fact ""work of aliens"". we have seen this before on this planet and we know what is caused from too. No, we have3 never seen a face show up as one of these landforms before but it is highly possible. This is why NASA states aliens did not do this and the photo was not editied. This photo shows a Martian landform and these landforms are on eath too. There are no aliens on earth it there? So how can these be from aliens, they are just landforms made naturally. This is in fact how OTHER_PII is incorrect and reseach showing the landform is natural is the real reason ""There is a face on Mars.""",3,1,0.8650733828544617

Some poeple think the Face is hard core evidence of life on mars. Meanwile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

The face on mars is a natural landform. Mars has powerfull winds just like we do on earth which if the dirt gets built up on rocks it can cause a face looking shape. The face is just a maountain with craters up at the top which makes it look somewhat like a human face. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work."" Mars gGlobal Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5km-wide strips.

But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees norht martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

I think that the Face is just some kind of rock formation. If the Face has anything to do with an alien, we would be as suprise and intrested as all you guys would be.

First of all, if the Face relate to some kind of alien things, why do you think we would keep it a secret? Imagine that it actually had to do something with alien and we told everyone. That would be a benefit for us because more people would be intested in NASA. It will make us get more money make good profits. We as a scientist would actually want to see some kind of alien artifact too but that is not what we are finding right now.

Second of all, the people who said we are hiding something don't even have any prove. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that "" We felt this was important to taxpayers"". That shows that we are not hiding anything. We send a spacecraft twice after the first picture which was in 1976 with a better camar to really make sure what we say is true. We even show the would all the picture. The people who said we are hiding something have no idea what they are talking about.

In conclusion, I am telling you that the Face we saw on Mars was nothing but a rock formation. Don't believe in everything you hear because some of them do not have prove of what they are saying.

One way we know that the landform on mars is not made by aliens is that; scientist took a sharper photograph of the ""face"" in 2001.

23f58d4,"NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's ""sister"" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that ""so called aliens"" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage. What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there.

One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. The ""face"" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.

That part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. Notice photo two? Its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. This is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on Mars.

If you still do not believe me, then this next part will. If you think about it, why would NASA keep an amazing discover like this a secret? The answer is that they would not. If NASA went worldwide with their ""face"" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.

In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their ""face"", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This ""so called face"" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.",4,1,0.7964360117912292
2421da3,"""The Face"" on Mars has brought up alot of attention. People are debating whether or not it is real or fake. There are two sides to the argument. Is it a sign of aliens or civilization, or is it just a natural landform on Mars? Some people even say is it even a face at all. Let's find out what it really is.

The face can be argued as a landform or something that an ancient civilation made. We as a whole, NASA, have confirmed it is a natural landform found on Mars, a mesa. Mesas are actually quite common in the American West according to the article. There has been no signs that an ancient civilization has lived on Mars, so it is highly unlikely that the face could've been built by aliens. Although it is possible, it is highly unlikely.

If there was alien life on Mars, we (NASA) wouldn't deny it, because all it would do is bring us more money and more exploration to do. If there would be one sign of ancient civilization on Mars, then that might just mean that it could or once did support life. We have checked to make sure that there is signs of life on and near the face by taking multiple pictures like the pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001. Some said that alien markings were hidden by haze but we have proven them wrong as seen from the pictures.

In conclusion, ""The Face"" that has been argued about is just a natural landform called a mesa. It is not alien made, it is natural. Although it is possible for aliens to have created something on Mars, we have not found any signs of alien life capable of making such things. So for now, there is no signs of aliens that we know of yet. But once we do find a sign, you better bet that we, NASA, will tell as soon as possible.        ",3,1,0.8814307451248169

On May 24,2001-twenty-five years ago something weird happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was snapping pictures of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted something that looked like a face.

An enormous head seem to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Scientists thought it was just another Martian mesa,common around Cydonia. In paragraph two it states,'Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh'.The ''Face on Mars''has since become a pop icon.

I can prove my arguement in many ways. For example, it states in the text that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform"". Just that last sentence alone can make my arguement 10 times better. That statement proves to us it was just a natural landform. In addition to this, in the article it states "" there was no alien monument after all."". Which tells us there was never alien monument and that never was made by aliens.

As you can see in the picture, it looks pretty old. Which should really show everyone something. The photo as taken in 1976. With our newer, more advanced cameras it shows that its just a natural landform on Mars. In the article it states that "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you can see wwhat they were!"". Which means if we really wanted to, we can capture a picture of the so called ""face"" or natural landform. Also then we would be able to prove what it is and what it is not.

There are many other reasons why this arguement can be won by either side, but there is never a true answer until someone goes onto the planet Mars and takes a look at the face or landform in person. in fact, I will always stand my ground and say it is just a natural landform on Mars.

249867d,"Twenty five years ago an enormous head almost two miles end to end has been seen to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called Cydonia. For some conspiracy theorists, they thought that it was a sign of life on Mars, or it may be from some kind of ancient civilization that was there millions of years ago. Some of them say it almost looks like the ancient egyption statues built on Earth.

Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, after the viking missions ended. Chief scientist explained ""We felt this was important to taxpayers."" So on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. They've got new technology so now the picture has more detail in it, it even shows some rocks on the Mars surface. When the picture was released to the public, it was now revealed a natural landform, no sign of alian civilization or any type of mark.

Not everyone was satisfied with the Face being ruled a natural landform. Some say the camera on board Mars Global Surveyor had to look through clods to see the Face. Skeptics considered alien markings were hidden by the clouds. The Face is a very interesting much more can lay behind the discovery but as the Global Surveyor pass through it when it is all clear they take a picture that is very vlear for all to see. The extraordinary photo was the best photo they have ever taken of the face ruling it a natural landform.

The Face is a very popular among Hollywood films. It has appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and more, It is truly a pop icon. SOme people think that that face a very good evidence for life on Mars. Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorist, Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget would rather wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

The Face resembles a human face like the statues in our ancient civilzation built by egyptians. Our ancient monuments are very and amazingly common to the Face. What if this was ancient civilization at its best. After the cloudless summer picture the world has ruled The Face a natural landform not ancient monument in any means, Some Skeptics still believe however. So as we go on there may be more discoveries that lay behind the monument maybe proof of ancient civilization. Mars is a very indistinctable place, NASA may stumble upon some proof that life beyond Earth exist.",3,1,0.7590961456298828

The people at NASA have many reasons why the Face is not an alien artifact. First,

Cydonia became a prority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended which had a impact on the Face. Second, a cheif scientst for NASA's Mars Exploration Program said that "" They felt this was important to taxpayers"". I totally argree with him and what he said, it would be very important to the taxpayers.Then, ""We photographged the Face as soon as we could get a good shoot at it"".

Many people had to play an important role to tell that NASA wasnt created by aliens. On April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time a man named ""Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos."" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL website reveal a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Although many people werent yet quit satisfied. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face due to it being winter.They started to think "" Perhaps, said skepticss, alien markings were hidden by the haze."" Misson controllers began to prepare to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin."" In fact its hard work"".

Many people still began to think that the Face was created by aliens. On April 8,2001 a cloudless day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. "" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's abssolute maxium resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 images had spanned 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. The picture showed the Maritan equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West.

Many people thought that the Face was created by aliens, but turns out it was a natural landform. The NASA had to take mant steps for them to be able to complete this task. The NASA had took many important roles to find out if it was an natural landform. Being a scientist at NASA is an important job.

24e6449,"Some claim that a picture of a natural landmark and a shadow is really a sign of alien lifeform or a civilization. Nasa a billion dollar company dissagrees and has proof that this is indeed a landmark with a shadow and not any sort of alien life. That has not stopped some conspiracy theorists from saying that this is a cover up.

Nasa as we all know is a company that is paid to fly unmanned and sometimes manned aircraft into the sky and most excitingly space. That is a positive thing for us humans who have no idea why we are here and how are we here. People don't like to know or believe the truth and sometimes make up lies or takes something the wrong way and make everyone from the news to the everyday household hear about something that didn't even turn out to be true. That is the same case here, Nasa released a photo of a mountain during a time of day that would have shadows, and Nasa being a public and government company is forced by law to release photos to the people. Which leads to more proof if Nasa took more photos that showed aliens or other inteligent lifeforms they would have to release it they can't just magicly hit erase.

Conspiracy theorist still do not believe Nasa so they demand more photos and still Nasa has even more proof that this ""face'' is indeed a montain with shadows stratigicly placed to look like a human face. Theorist say that everything Nasa does is either faked or fixed to look like something it is not. In this case it went viral and many people still believe it was aliens that went there and did that but Nasa declines and this time Nasa has a little more proof.

Nasa would've got money to send a human or a robot to Cydonia if it were a human lifeform or an alien, and we all know the team that worked on it would've got some pretty heavy paychecks just by working on the case, just imagine that checks the team would make if it were a civilivation. But Nasa will not be sending over humans or a robot for a couple reasons, the best reason is that the already know that this is just a mountain, not a civiliation.

In conclusion Nasa knows this is a mountain and not a lifeform of any kind.

Nasa also knows that lifeforms like ours can not survive on the surface of any planet without an atmousphere like mars. So even if a lifeform can survive without oxygen unlike us that the proof of that area says otherwise.   ",4,1,0.6496838331222534
24e6877,"The Mars Face has been a popular topic for ages. People still argue about if its an alien artifact or just a nutural formation on Mars. Some people are thinking NASA is just lying. Some people at NASA wish that they had found evidence of alien life.

The Mars Face is a natural landform known as a mesa. These landforms are commun throughout the west part of America. These landforms are formed by plate tectonics. There are a lot of landforms on Earth that are the same as the Mars Face.

The face got its look from shadows. The Viking 1 spacecraft did not have a high level of technology. The space age has developed lots of technology since the 1970's. I mean they just got a man on the moon a few years prior to the Viking 1. So in 1998 a high level camera did fly over and take very graphic and detailed pictures of the Face showing it's just a landform. Since the technology level wasn't very good in 1976 they couldn't zoom in like the Mars Orbiter Camera Team did, so the shadows were apparent there and not in the 1998 photograph. The pixel size is greater in the 2001 photo than the 1976. The reson the face appeared was because of the technology level back in 1976 they Viking 1 couldn't zoom in far enough to get past the shadows.

With this evidence I hope you're convinced there are no aliens on Mars or ever was. NASA would be estactic if they found alien life. The Face is not an alien made memorial or artifact. The Face is a natural landform that occurs on our own planet.   ",3,1,0.8791816234588623

mars globe surveyspace craft revealed the face of mars is a mesa (intro) ,scientists found it was just another martian mesa(2).

A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a “huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.” The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars(3).

on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa—landforms common around the American West. “It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,” says Garvin. “That’s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.”(12).therefore there is no alien life forms on other planets.

In 1998, Michael Malin's MOC captured a picture ten times sharper than the first. The photo showed us a natural landform. Some weren't so easily swayed.

However, conspiracy theorists Think that the face is evidence of life on Mars. That NASA would want to hide exactly that. At the same time defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient civilization there.

You probably have on its been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazinesw, radio talk shows, even in grocery store checkouts lines for 25 years! NASA is researching this closely. The Face is just a natural landform because how would aliens make a face in the middle of Mars? Why would they? In Mars there's all sort of natural landforms so who knows?

How would aliens make a face in Mars? Why? I don't know either its kind of seems impossible. Aliens might have step on it to make it look like a Face but they would have made it on purpose. To me it does look like an Egyptian Pharaoh but back then they were barely finding out what Mars was or didn't even know about Mars. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia they took pictures then times sharper than the original pictures, then when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing it was a natural landform. There was no alien manument after all.

In Mars theres all sort of natural landforms created by Mars weather that makes landforms look cool and interesting. When NASA send viking 1 it was circling the planet getting phtos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Thats when NASA started reseaching it. In April 5, 1998, it was proven that it was just natural landform. Through the years the face starts cracking and fading away because of the weather. The weather of Mars is usually unpredictable, but usually cold. Also the wind in Mars is pretty commen and it makes the land look like a lot of weird things!

So Mars makes all type of natural landforms and why would aliens make a face in Mars? How? I dont know either. Its all of about Mars weather that makes this natural landforms, but its mostly the wind. It looks like an Egyption Pharoah but later on it starts disappearing because of the conditions of Mars.

Have you wondered if the face on mars was aliens or a landform? If you did im going to help you answer that question that you have beenn wondering. I used to want to know what the face on mars really was NASA said it was a landform but reporters, people in movies, and in magazines thought it was aliens. Who would you believe someone who has actually been studying about it for the longest and went to school for it or your favorite director.

I thought it was aliens too because of all the magazines and movies i had seen about it but they were all jumping to conlusions. So then i decided to do a little research myself. After i started researching i started to write articles and put them online or in the newspaper, and anywhere else that i could. During all of my research i found out that it actually is a landform.

As in the article it says not all scientists beleived it was an alien im not saying none of them did but some of them didnt eventually i got a call from NASA they wanted me to join them. They said my work was outstanding and they would love to work with me, my immediate answer was yes. My immediate answer was yes because NASA was my dream job even when i was younger i wanted to be in NASA.

We began to research even more traveling in space trying to find more clues. We had no luck for quite some time until... we had a storm and after that we went back to look and there was another face. We immediately documented the photos and got to writing so we could publish it.

Everyone believed the movie stars and all those other people becasue they have lots of money but they didnt think about intelligence. NASA has lots of it i believed the rich people to at first,but i failed to see the intelligence until i started researcing on my own. When I joined NASA i really found the intelligence now im employee of the month for coming up with the idea to go back.

-

If i were given a chance towork for NASA truthfully i would not take the job i don't really like science jobs like that . Anyways , i don't think that the faces were created by aliens . (Why dont i think it was created by aliens) that's a very good question first off aliens are made up creatures they are just tools to make science non fictional movies come to life . I just strongly think that aliens are made up they can't be real there is no proof to back up what everyone believes . Space doesn't have any gravity so their can't be any animals up there floating ! The mask kinda looks like clay maybe the mask is made out of clay that you can mold it into anything you want ! I know that sounds crazy but someone thinking that a alien created makes it sound even more crazier ! Lets be VERY serious The article says ""Face on Mars has been popular in magazines and talk shows"" People will believe anything these days even i know that half of the things that the media says or does is not true and i also know that they make things up for attention or too be well known . Now if i got paid as much as the talk show host i may have told some fibs from time to time !

Body - I have to remember that everybody has a opinion and everybody has a input . I am a ""Show me and i'll believe type girl"" I don't have any evidence or proof that Aliens are real and that they the mask it just doesnt fit together that's like saying pigs can fly ! There is NO proof so i can't process it i know somebody named De'Oshmonya that knows a lot about mars and space so i may have to ask her what she thinks about it im sure she will tell me everything i need to know ! It may cause a little argument tho , but thats okay we're still going to be close . This passage helped me because it taught me some things i didn't know and it prepares me for the future it does make me wonder Are aliens real ? When i go to sleep tonight i may do some research and i'll try to find some proof . I should've done research so i could have a lot of evidence to back my statement up that would've been the best thing to do .

Conclusion - Even tho i said i don't believe in aliens it does make me question alot of things . This article was written way before i was born things have changed and everything should be different now. Maybe if aliens were real they were probably alive in the ancient times and probably left when the dino's left . I just never know Ela is my favorite subject it always makes me learn new things and it helps me understand more than i knew before . Ela is very tricky and sometimes it gets confusing but in the end it helps you and expands your knowladge to the finer things in life . I hope that you got the correct answers out of my paragraph hopefully i can come back next year and be prepared to tell everyone about my research !!!",1,1,0.7430715560913086
25e3cc1,"Face on Mars! Natural landform? or Created by Aliens? I believe that the structure is a natural landform. NASA would not want to hide life on mars. They have been researching for years to find life on Mars.

NASA has been researching Mars for years looking for living things. Nothing was ever found. So, why believe there was ever ancient civilization on Mars, if through out all the research, nothing was ever found. Some still disagree and believe that there is new life on Mars. But, in order for there to be a new there has to be an old.

When Garvin decided he wanted to get a better look at the face on Mars himself, he also agreed that it would be a natural landform. He used a digital image three times bigger that the pixle size. Therefore, if there were any signs of live, shakes, houses, aliens, ect. you would be able to point it out from the picture.

Yet, there was still nothing found. Although some people still believe aliens live on Mars, and aliens created the face structure. There is proof that you can not spot any digns of life on Mars. So, therefore, we come to the conclusion that the structure was a natural landfor, that just so happened to look like a face.   ",3,1,0.8527329564094543

The theorists where still not happy about the photo take. On the that day mars had a dust strom that day so the picture kinda had a haze to it. So the mission controllers had to prepare to take another picture. So they did and on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day on mars the picture was took.

Once agian the picture showed that there were no alien houses or monuments. The picture was taken with absolute maximum resolition. So you could see every little detail on mars.

So there is the mask that in mars. We are now trying to dicorver what this strange thing is. From what i am seeing .Its seems that this face is an unusual face that no one have seen before. As far as the scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, Commom enough around Cydonia.

A few days later . NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . Which resembles a human Head . . . Formed by shadows gigivg the illusion of eyes , noes , and mouth"" The Authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract to mars.

The "" Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon . It has started in hollywood film , appeared in books, magaznines , radio talk shows--even huanted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars---evidence that NASA would rather hide , say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars.

So on April 5, 1998, When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times Sharper than the orginal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

So they all came together and thought about it . So there Now exchanging it all right .There trying to say that the picture from NAS is not the right picture which is so true . There trying to still the picture from somebody else which there trying to take the credit from mars which found the picture and put it all together . So now there all confused on which just happen when mars was just stating the simple facts that they found the oicture ands knows where the ou=ther one is and theere going to put it back together so they can have the right picture only if . NASA don try to come over welm them with a different picture which is going to throw them off topic and confuse then on which to do and what not to do because they came with the wrong information and mars had all the right information to which to out and how to put it all together and complete the big puzzle everybody been trying to out together because all alone they had it from the beging but was not sure it wass right nor positive and sure about that picture so when the NASA came to mars and try to prove them wrong on a nother level they out stood them, and made them think over so now NASA about to go back and try to discover the othere peices to the puzzle when its already solved they dont understand that they already have the puzzle figured out all along but now there trying to take what Mars had and say they found it first but not only that . But they have found something else which identify that that puzzle have been put together before the NASA found it . But its seems to me that the reader that MARS have found the puzzle face and put it together and now NASA is on envestigation once Again.               ",2,1,0.8578640818595886

Besides there has to be life on mars or had to be life on mars..Why? Well because of all of the evidence they are finding and found.. But when they found these face like figures on mars they were set that there has to be and there is life on mars.. On the face like structure you can point out the eyes,the nose,and the mouth.. Once they gather up all this information and put it together they will adventally get somwhere..Or mabby they will lead there selfs to life on mars,you may never know...In the past year we have found lots of information and evidence from mars....

. It was actually a better idea to keep the "" Face on Mars "" a secret just between the NASA team , then if nothing was bad news it could have been told after getting all the right information . The possiblities on knowing what this is and letting everyone know was very hard . It's been there since 1976 and in 2001 , at last some resoltes on the Face on Mars .

The face on Mars was photographed, so we arent really seeing what the face on Mars looks exactly like, but we are seeing alot of it. Though, the image of the face in the best Viking photo in 1976 proves to show that, because of the 2001 photo's image span of 1.56 meters, if there were ships, planes, or even small shacks, you would be able to spot them out in the photo. What the Viking photo really shows is the Martian equivalant of a butte or mesa, which are both found commonly in the American West. Therefore, Mars has many land formations of all shapes and sizes, so the face that we all know and are so curious about; could just be another on of Mars natural landforms.",2,1,0.86033034324646

It revealed a natural land form , because there was no alien monument anyway. The picture shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a landform that common around the american west. The face is just a example of corrosion on mars that there was a rock there that after so long got corroded into looking like a face by chance. It coulnt have been by alien hands because we wouldv noticed some type of life form around it by now. And the research shows that it is just a rock form that was corroded into a face. by the way you can only see it in certain ways.",2,1,0.8607186675071716
266c5f9,"Many years ago NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars, trying to get any photos of possible landing sites for it's sister ship known as Viking 2. As the spacecraft was taking these photos, they spotted a cohesive head. At first the scientists thought that it was probably just another Martian mesa, but the thing about this one was that it had very unusual shadows that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh.

Days later NASA let the picture out for the world to see. The picture went viral within days. This had become one of the most famous talked about things in the world. It appeared in books, magazines, radio talks, shows, etc.

There were very few scientists who believed the Face could've been an alien artifact, but photographing Cydonia became a major priority for NASA. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time. At this time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a picture of the Face that was very sharp and you could tell what it was.

On April 5, 1998 many excited and anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to show up somewhere. The image did pop up but it wasn't what the web surfers were expecting. Most people were dissapointed when they found out that the picture of the face they had been waiting for, turned out to be just a natural land form.

What I have stated proves that the Face is a natural land form. It may have looked like a face in the blurred picture, but we now know that it was just a landform. ",2,1,0.8006459474563599
26c493a,"People can prove from the article that this ""face"" in mars was only a natural landform. We've been told that Earth and Mars used to be a like in many ways, like size, and also the fact that Mars used to have water. With that being said this means that probably both Earth and Mars can form mesas on thier planets. The way that the probes found it was a surprise, it was looking for its other Viking 2. The mission controllers were indeed surprised but wanted to look at it a little closer just to see what it was exactly. They found out that it wasn't a human or alien but a landform, that was made naturally.

After releasing the photo everyone came up with thier suspicions, which many disagree aren't true. The landform itself was about 2 miles or longer, after that being said it was and should've been clear it wasn't a mythical creature. NASA had only did this research for many peoples questions, it would pay off taxpayers. Telling from the pictures the ""face"" in the 1976 photo, agree does like like a face but over time in 2001 this face seemed to flaten. Also if if were a face, it would be late to actually go Mars and observe because it would've already faded or deformed. Judging by what's left of the evidence that is found by that time will not be able to prove if it was an ailen or not.

In conclusion, i think these people can be proven wrongly. One of the scientists said that in fact it was hard to keep taking the same pictures but in a better view. It was hard, because they didn't pass over it very often. It's a waste of energy for the probe and money for the company to keep sending it, just so people can make other assumptions and theories that are irrelevent.",3,1,0.8832830786705017
26c804d,"Many people may argue that the landscape in the picture taken in 1976 was a landscape made by aliens. These people think the landscape was created by an alien because the picture resembled a human head with eyes, nose, and a mouth. In fact, this image became so popular in the next 25 years, that it started to show on books and magazines. Some people still think that the landscape was created by aliens. However, the Face was created by aliens has been proven false because the of the new data and research over the next 30 years showed that it was just a mesa.

Scientists examined this photo to actually prove if the landscape was actually made by aliens or not. After research, our NASA scientists and I proved that it was just a mesa which are common around Cydonia. To become more factual about this, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took more pictures of the Face. This occured in 1998 with better cameras than the first ones taken in 1976. The picture became 10 times clearer than the first picture taken which led to our conclusion that it was indeed just a mesa.

In response to those who still believe that the Face was created by aliens, our data has shown that is not. We even took more photos in 2001 showing clearly that the Face is just a normal mesa. There were no human features in the pictures that were taken in 2001 unlike the ones from 1976. Our scientists and I ensure you that this is just a regular mesa which are common to find.

26d36e5,"The Unusual Rock Formation

When the ""Face of Mars"" was discovered many people had very different accusations and claims. Many people(including scientists) thought it was created suddenly by aliens. Although, that can be a possibility, it really wasn't the case for this certain situation. The reason being, was because NASA along with its scientists have many reasons for the ""Face of Mars"" to be a just a natural landform on Mars. They even have enough evidence to supprt their perspectives of the identity of the ""Face of Mars"".

First, the scientists took many sharpening images to see all the specific details of the this natural rock formation. In the article, it states that photographing Cydonia became a priority of NASA. That this huge rock formation was only made by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The scientist not only took one photo, and were done with the discovery, they took many photos. As the article shows that they took many photos from 1976, 1998, and 2001, the scientists took the information they had, and came to a conclusion, that this was only a gigantic rock formation.

Furthermore, when the scientists took the photos, they also discovered that this landform didn't have anything unusual because they can basically see everything from their spacecraft. As the article states, they took the digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This mean that the scientists throughout the years have made this photos more and more sharpenly to see all the details, and see exacly what this mystery of a rock formation is. So, when they took the pixel size larger and larger they realized they reached the end of their discovery. The reason was because it was really zoomed it, that even if there were Egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks you could see them.

Then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a rock landform, many people argue that it was an usual formation created by aliens. Scientists and other people believe it was an alien aritifact. Even though the scientists couldn't get a valuable picture of the formation because of the wispy clounds, many people believed that it was skeptics alien markings hidden by the haze. On the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still cover the formation, but that didn't happen because the scientist ended up taking realistic photos of the face rock.

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" is only a simple rock landform with an unusual formation of a human face. There are many reasons why,including the photos, and how they came to be much sharper and detailed by the range of the pixels. Also, the rock formation was in Cydonia, whcih really wan't a mysterious plant, considering that NASA immediately got informed by it.

Even though, there has been enough evidence in photos, many people believe it was created mysteriosly be aliens. In the end, it's just a landform in a whole different planet, so how can one simple face-like formation be created by aliens?    ",5,1,0.8867988586425781
26d67e1,"Though some may argue that the Face is alien made I belive I can prove them wrong. There have been many theories many are just based on others opinions instead of actual facts. So, how can we the scientist be right well, it's simple you use research.

Though I am on the side that the Face is just a land formation I can start to see the theorists point. In the begging yes it was some what unclear. Because theorists gave reasons to belive we couldn't see only because it was a cloudy time as said in paragraph 8. Also, it's hard to forget or just drop something as big as this which lasted 25 years. The Face was a highlight to a dull world it gave some people reason to believe that we are not alone and that event sparked so many other theories. But, never the less these theorists certinally need to get a day job and just quite while their ahead.

Now, that we have delved into the side that most don't join. I'd like to talk about why the Face should just be forgoten. When Viking 1 had been sent up in May of 2001 we along with theorists were curious about what was found. But with careful examination we were able to see it was nothng out of the ordinary. In paragraph 3 we had described it as "" as a huge rock formation with shadow that gave th illusion of a human face. In which case meant we had nothing to hide although some beg to differ. But, with some still demanding we have a closer look we had finally agreed.

In our case it was not an easy as stated in paragraph 9 '' cydonia is not easy to target."" Nevertheless we had acomplished our task and gave the people what they wanted. We had even had the technology to show everthing that could be seen on there. And of cousre NASA is stil correct becausce nothing was found just a rock that looked like a face. To compare it we had said""

its is equivalnt to a mesa or the Middle Butte in the American west.""

In conclusion, I believe that I have shown enough evidence to put theorists in their place along with others, who belive the Face is alien made. Though we and many others would have loved\benefited from it it is now proven there are no

Egyptian style pryamids , airplanes on the ground, or even small shacks. So to wrap it all up I belive and have proven that the Face on mars is nothing and should just disapear.",4,1,0.7143902778625488
27226f8,"Many people have been fascinating over whether or not the Face is a natural landform or some alien marking. NASA has been trying to uncover the mystery for more than 20+ years, however, because there is not solid evidence on whether or not aliens exist this 'marking' would be classified as a natural landform.

The Face is classified a natural landform for many reasons. What evidence do we have that proves aliens are real? We have TV shows and theories on the internet but that does not prove the fact that aliens may or may not exist. TV shows and the internet posts are based of opinionated desicions. Also, with the era we are living in technology has advanced greatly. Which is a major benefit. Cameras are a big thing for NASA, it is photographic evidence. In 1976 Vikings used a 43 meters per pixel photograph (This made the photo blurry), in 2001 NASA memebers used a 1.56 meter span which greatly increased the resolution.

Not only has technology been a major benifit, weather is a key factor when the pictures were taken. When the picture was taken by the Vikings it was a cloudy time of the year for the Red Planet. After a few years of examining whether or not the Face was an alien artifact scientists decided to check for themselves and when another photograph was taken the image appeared clear and revealing.

However, the Face artifact was not proven yet to be a natural landform, therefore it could be symbolized as an alien artifact. From research, not one person has attempted to dig up or around this alien artifact to prove that it is nothing more than a natural landform. With that, there have been MANY alien sightings, not just by everyday citizens but by professionals too! Also, not only do scientists lie about the truth (most of the time), NASA could be lying about whether or not this is an alien marking or a natural landform.

Although it is true there are few scientists who do cover up the truth about the world around us, why would a scientists, let alone a national government agency want to hide an amazing artifact that could teach us so much? They wouldn't because that would be a huge loss of money. With the theory there are many ""sighting"" of aliens has 1 person ever come into face-to-face contact with an alien? No, there are only pictures of what proves to be an alien lifeform. Creating an image on an alien can be used with photoshop or other editing tools.

While it is true people can use photoshop to create an image NASA wouldn't lie about an alien artifact. With TV shows, YouTube videos and many pictures there has been enough evidence presented to PROVE aliens exist and that an alien could be leaving behind an marking to tell humanity about something.

With this concluding essay, there has been enough evidence to prove that NASA and scientists have no reason to lie about whether or not this Face is claimed to be a landform or an alien artifact. Therefore, the Face has been claimed and proven a natural landform because there is no solid evidence of an Alien leaving strange markings behind.",4,1,0.747677206993103
2748f2a,"I dont know what is out there but I know what is happining in my own back yard. There is no way the face on marse's surface was made by aleans because we have photographic images that prove so, and by telling it was made by alien it would just help us. So if you really think that that the alience made the face on mars then you don't know any of the facts.

First of all we have the picktures to prove it. So maybe the first one wasn't as clear becaus of the times, but the next one was ten times better. It doesn't sound like a lot but for what the first one looked like was like eating fake oreos to the real ones. But that was on a cloudy night and because it was you still don't belive it. So we went and took an other one (even thought it was hard sence we dont pass it very often). Nevertheless we got it in all of its NON alian glory. With the next picture we got in 2001 you have to belive us that it was a rock. It was 43 meters per pixel compared to the first that was 1.56. If you dont know what that means then let me just tell you it was way better.

Also why would we ruin a great oportunity like that. If we had said it was from alien we would have goten so much money. Imagen all the questions that would have been asked that we might have not have been able to answer on earth. People would start demanding their questions be answed and we would not be able to do it. So we ask for money we would get the best to make it posible for us to get to the red planet and boom we are on mars and we make an other small step.

So if you want to look stupid and belive that the aliens made a face on mars then do so, but the facts are that there is not one.

We have pictures and a want to go to mars that wont happen to prove it. And if after all that you dont belive me then writ your own paper convincing everyone it is a alian made Mount Rushmore and maybe NASA will Get to go to mars sitting on a rock.",3,1,0.7972321510314941
274b414,"The Face in Cydonia on Mars is merely a natural landform because if NASA has proof that The Face was created by aliens, the evidence would surely be shared with the world. Also, the Face is similar to several types of landforms on the Earth, and NASA has photographic evidence that the Face was not formed by aliens.

As mentioned in paragraph 5 of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the Face has ""become a pop icon."" Because the Face has ""appeared in books, magazines, (and) radio talk shows,"" people have become brainwashed into believing that the Face on the planet Mars was created by alien forces. People claim that NASA is hiding the evidence revealing that the Face is actually made by aliens. However, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Not only would the proof of aliens bring in an abundance of excitement for Mars, but it would also gain NASA a great deal more of revenue. NASA

is not hiding any form of evidence towards alien-life on Mars, and the Face may not have anything special about it besides the fact that it looks ""like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

The Face on Mars is extremely similar to several landforms found on the Earth. As explained in paragraph 12, the Face is similar in design to ""a butte or mesa,"" which are ""landforms common around the American West."" Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, notes that the Face reminds him of ""'the Snake River Plain of Idaho.'"" In the Snake River Plain, there is a ""'lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.'"" This is evidence to support that the Face is no different from any other natural landform, and that people have no reason for speculation against that idea. Another big reason to believe this claim is because professional scientists have pictures for evidence against aliens.

Scientists at NASA have photographic evidence against the claim that the Face is alien-made. People who claim that the Face was created by aliens will state that the photograph taken in April of 1998 was not enough proof of the Face being a natural landform. As stated in paragraph 8, the photographers ""had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face"" because ""it was winter."" This means that any proof of aliens could have easily been hidden by the haze covering Mars. So, in April 2001, a better picture was captured. In paragraph 10, it is mentioned that this time the photograph was taken on ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia"" and that the evidence showed up with ""absolute maximum resolution."" This picture, in its high quality, proved that the Face truly was nothing more than a natural landform on Mars.

If NASA had any proof that aliens had caused the Face to appear, the evidence would surely be shared. The Face is close in size and design to a landform in Idaho, and NASA has photographic evidence that there are no signs of aliens anywher near Cydonia. Because of these reasons, one can clearly see that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. ",5,1,0.8951927423477173
2774edc,"The Face on Mars is a very interesting landmark. Some people believe that aliens created this mask while NASA believes the Face is just a natural landform. There are very important reasons why the Face is just an ordinary landform and this essay will list them all. I will try to convince a person why the Face is a natural landform.

First of all, the Face can't possibly be made by aliens because pictures show that it is just a natural landform and not an alien monument. This was very disappointing to some but it was the truth. Evidence of the pictures still didn't satisfy some believers. They still believed that the alien monument was the Face and that there are aliens in the world. So again, a camera went up on the MGS to look through the clouds. Once again, the pictures revealed it was not an alien monument. Still, people continued to believe that the alien markings were hidden by the haze. Many people wanted to believe that the monument was from aliens but really it was just an ordinary landform.

Strong alien believers took to thinking that NASA was hiding something from everyone. This doesn't make any sense because why would NASA put the picture of the Face out for everyone to see when they wanted to hide aliens from being alive. Also, aliens would be a great discovery to NASA and would help the institution. Everyone would want proof of the aliens and NASA would make millions of dollars if they got pictures of these ""aliens"". This again was proven false and showed that the ""alien monument"" was really just a natural landform that formed over years of rocks and dust.

Everyone was stuck on the idea that aliens were real and that's why the Face is there. But in reality no one has any evidence of aliens even being alive. Now people think that the Face is proof, but again they are wrong. For a third time, Mars Global Surveyor took some pictures of the landmark on a cloudless day. It was a very clear picture that couldn't hide anything at all. They searched the whole perimeter and there wasn't any small shacks, airplanes, or pyramids hiding to prove the opinion of aliens being alive. Thus, it finally showed the majority of alien believers that the Face was an actual landmark that wasn't built by aliens. They actually found that it resembled Middle Butte which is a similar height to the Face.

There is too much evidence to still believe that aliens have created the Face. There is no proof that aliens have built this landform and that, in actuality, aliens are even a real, living thing. Even though there is an enormous amount of evidence there are still some people who live for aliens. The Face, as a natural landform, has so much reasoning that there is no way around it. This incredible natural structure is, in fact, not built by aliens.      ",4,1,0.8876304030418396
279e329,"Plan:A photo from 1998,is a pciture of a mask. So why they ""MGS"" claims is not a face? We don't,be we do know is that a high-resolution images and 3D altimetry takes picture from outer space. It says that ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snapping photo possible landing sites for it's sister ship"". Meaning that maybe their is a possibitiy that maybe there is an ""Anicent civilization"" that lived on Mars that we don't know about. It also says, ""A few days later NASA unveilied the images for all to see.

This shows that NASA was trying to keep it a sercet that theirs are head with a mouth,eyes,noes,and ears on Mars and they wasn't trying to put in no type of effort to get deeper in the situation or not even assummed is not normal for a planet that has nobody lived on and has a unusal head that just poped up out of nowhere on ""Planet Mars"".",2,1,0.8602440357208252
27c0af1,"Thousands of axious web surfers were waiting when the first image appeared on a JPL websit revealing...a natural landform"". Those people must've been really upset upon hearing this news. They had high hopes for The Face to be a creation of alien life on mars. But due to the fact that it's just a butte/mesa, an illusion, and just a piece of rock all together, those people need to accept the truth: Alien's didn't make The Face.

First of all, the Face is just an illusion, or a trick playing with your eyes. An example would be that when NASA unveiled the image, the caption said as quoted, ""...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth..."" This example shows that because of the perfect shadow casting, the rock formation on mars is just an illusion that's messing with your mind.

My second reason as to why The Face isn't a sign of alien life is that is resembles a butte or a mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. An example of this would be that it reminds Garvin of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This example shows that since it may remind people of other landforms that we have on Earth, and that we even have landforms similar to The Face at all, it must be and is a natural landform.

My third and final reason is that The Face is just a pile of Mars rocks. For example, when a foucused picture of this landform went viral, it was clear that it was just a pile of rocks, rather than the original picture, which was 10 times less foucused then the latest one. Knowing this, it is clear that aliens did NOT in fact, create The Face.

Some people might say that aliens mightve moved the rocks there themselves. This wouldn't be the case, considering that there are no clear signs of life on mars currently. No aliens means no alien made faces on mars. It's purely logical that The FAce is just an illusion and a pile of rocks and nothing more. ",4,1,0.8438569903373718
27c2c70,"The Face on Mars was a natural creation. It is similar to the Middle Butte landform in Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. The facial features was created by shadows makily it look eerely like a face. The features of the Face are an optical illusion. NASA concluded that it was not made by aliens.

The Face is similar to teh Middle Butte. The Middle Butte is a lava dome that takes the form of a face. The landforms are common around the western parts of the United States. The picture shows a face that could only be like the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho. This is how the Face could be a natural feature. The Middle Butte from Idaho was formed when lava and the earth combined and made it look like a face when you are on Google Earth. The Face on Mars is just like the Middle Butte that is in Idaho. It is possible that there was once lava or a liquid that combined with the surface to make a facial feature that you see when you look at the Face on Mars. The Face on Mars is also not very well detailed. If it was a monument then it would have detail. It would have eyebrows or details around the mouth and eyes so it resembled a certain person. This is how the Middle Butte on Mars is a natural figure.

The Face was an optical issusion. There was shadows that made the Face look relatively similar to a human face. The shadows also could have been formed by the clouds that were blocking the view of Viking for a while. The Viking had to get closer to take a picture of the natural landform. The landform could have been just a pile of dirt or a pile of rocks that had holes that made it look simillar to a face. Some people argue that the alien markings were hidden by the hazey clouds. When the Viking went over the Face it only took a few pictures. When the Mars Global Surveyor went over Cydonia for the first time they snapped a picture 10 times better than the original Viking picture. The picture from Mars Global Surveyor had better quality than the picture from Viking. This is how the clouds and the camera on the Viking made an optical illusion.

NASA concluded that the Face was not like the Egytian style pyramids. They came to a decision that the Face was just a landform that under the certain circumstances looked like a face. The people at NASA also said that the camera had zoomed in so that if there was a shack or an airplane or a person on the ground that they would be able to see it. NASA even used a different camera that has better zoom than the one used in 1976. The camera used in 1976 was 43 meters per pixel. The one used in 2001 was 1.56 meters per pixel. If they didn't find any proof of alien life with the 2001 image then how can you argue their is any aliens?

In conclusion the Face on Mars is a natural figure. NASA verified that the Face was just an optical issusion. The camera on Viking was not very good compared to the camera of later explore Mars Global. The camera on Mars Global was able to take a picture 10 times better than the one on Viking. The face and eyes and mouth were created by shadows. This is how the Face on Mars is not an alien monument. ",4,1,0.8504210114479065
27c512c,"This argument of the face on Mars been going on since 1976. Many people and even some scientest believe it is craftmenship of no other than aliens. Their have always been stories about how so called aliens live on the planet Mars,or how there is life on Mars. I am here to ease your mind and tell you it is no more than a mesa.

Their has been alot of talk about the rocky terrian we call Mars. First off this isn't the first case of where a face has been captured. On a nother part of the Red planet there is an area called Cydonia. Their was an image of a something that resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. That was just a shadow giving the unusal look of the pharaoh. This proves that not everthing is what it seems.

Next after discovering that this unusal look for Mars was just a shadow creating the illusion of having a human face we were fasinated and had to indoulge ourselvs in more reaserch. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor had gone over Cydonia. Our magnificant team of reashers got a picture that was a wopping ten times sharper than the origional photo. We had thousands of people waiting to see what was on our Red Planet it was nothing other than... a landform.

Then after that find we couldn't stop there. We were so close and we were desperate to find the truth. So we had studdied the pictures,and yet still nothing. The face on Mars was no different than your common landform on earth. We were sure right there it was nothing more than a lava dome that has molded its form into an isolates mesa.

Now some might say that our picture we claim that is extremly crediable could be nomore than a fluke, and there could be aliens and a chance for a new civilization on Mars. Now for us we wish there was an acient civilization on Mars, but we can't hide the truth. Finally for our picture in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, and if their was any sign of life like houses,airplanes,or even Egyptian styled pyrmids you would be able to see them. This how we know our information is credable.

Now it seames the whole "" Face on Mars"" in movies, books, magazines,and radio talk shows were all false. That whole franchisement was a total bust. Now that you know the truth and the face on Mars was nothing but fraud i hope that you listen to the people down at NASA. Now i hope i have eased your mind that there are no aliens running arround.",4,1,0.8874545097351074
27d745e,"When describing the face found on Mars I would first tell about how it was found. The face on Mars was located by accident by a spacecraft circling around the planet Mars taking snapshots of possible landing areas for its sister ship Viking 2, when the spacecraft saw a look-alike of a human face.

I would then start to describe the facts about the face. It was also enormous too,two miles long from end to end. At first scientists believed it was a Martian mesa, which was common around the area the face was located in. Eventually the picture was unveiled for the world to see, for 25 years the image was posted in haunted grocery check out lines or in books and magazines, it even stared in a hollywood film too. Although a few scientists did believe that the face found on mars wasn't in fact an alien artifact.

After i would then finishis by reveileing facts and information to them. The face had been photgraphed to get a clearer picture of what looked like to be the head of and Egyptian. Although Cydonia, the place where the face was located, is not easily found the photagraphers, on April 5, 1998, were able to find it and took more pictures to get good looks at it. What they found in the image's were actually showing a butte or mesa, commonly known as ladforms, they are also common around the west of America. The most likely scenerio for the face to of been built was by natural lanforms and erosion. Even some scientists believed that the face was just a landformation and not an alien artifact.",3,1,0.8356361985206604
27da61e,"Do you belive in aliens?

The first reason why i say that the face was just natural landforms is because,there is no such things as aliens! For example the text says"" a shadowy likeness of a human face."" This example show that likeness isn't always certain you have to be absolutley sure before you start making claims about what the picture is showing. Did you see it for yourself? Did you do any research about it?

Another reason why the alien story is real is because ,no one officially approved it. They only took pictures of the face.

No one went down on mars to examine or observe the face. An example for this would be that the passage says"" only this one had unusual shadws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"". This example shows that if it looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh how would the aliens know about it?

The next reason why the alien myth isnt true is because in the passage it says the word""illusion"" the word illusion means something that you can see but is not there. For example in the tex it states that "" formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth"". This example shows that an illusion may seem real but it is not real. You have to make sure that your facts are reliable and your resources are reliable.

Finally, why people say that the landfrom was formed by aliens is because it

"" appered in books, magazines and radio talk shows--- even haunted grocery store for 25 years"". They don't know just because this thing goes publice dosen't mean it is true. For example"" Some people thimk that it is bona fide evidence"". The people that think taht it is bona fide evidence did they do any research or did they just rely on what the social media says. In conclusion you should believe that the face is a natural landform is because aliens isn't real.        ",3,1,0.7686645984649658
27ea74c,"The Face is a natural landform and was not created by aliens. First of all why would NASA hide something like that from us? Second of all the Mars has not shown signs of life form, it has been vacient for as long as we know. Though it has been in moves, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and more for more than 25 years, don't beleve everything you here or see in a movie it's not factual.

NASA couldn't/wouldn't hide something like aliens from us. They have all of the facts they need to determen that this was not done by aliens. They have done reaserch and test to determan that its not done by aliens. Aliens are just mithical creatures.

Mars has been empty for as long as we have been able to go to Mars. It is just the rock formation and the shadow giving it the affect of looking like a face. The pictures show it was just rocks. The first one 43 meters per pixel compared to the new image that spans 1.56 meters both show the same thing.

The Face has been in moves, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and more for more than 25 years! Do you beleve in every move you watch,every magazine you read, or how about every talk show you listen to. Unless you do you probly dont beleve in this alien nosnese you beleve in reaserch and facts. NASA has come up with these facts to prove its not created by aliens.

The Face created by an alien is just a conspiracy theory. It is shaped like a face but it is the shadows that make us beleve it looks like a face. Do you think some how that aliens have made it so the shadows are alaways there so it always looks like a face.

Mars has as many aliens as we do here on earth. Secrets and lies all come out eventualy. Here on earth there is life formes but not on mars. This face has been everywhere but so has celebrties are you going the beleve everythig you here about them. This is all just a conspiracy theory and conspiracy theorys corupt.

28028e0,"In 1976 a land form was found on Mars that looked very similiar to a human face. Some people's minds immediatly thought that it was from aliens. This would make no sense because there are plenty of forms like this on Mars. Aliens wouldn't build a form that looked like humans. If it was an alien there would be proof, and we would know. This theory is way to far fetched to be the truth because this is just like any other land form on Mars. We have tons of evidence that prooves that it isn't from aliens and the only ""evidence"" the people that think it was the work of aliens have is that it looks like a face. There theory holds no water, yet people still believe it. Just look at the facts.

They discovered the face-looking form on a part of Mars called Cydonia. On Cydonia there are lots of forms called Martian mesas. It was not irregular to find one where they were at. The fact that it looked like a face was just a coincedence. It only looked like a face because of the way it was shadowing. To actually be from aliens all of the messas would of had to come from them because it was just like any other. There is no way that aliens made any of the others. The only reason that this one is believed to be built by them is only because it resembles a face. I'm sure if you looked hard enough you could find another form that resembled something, and then people would think that it was from aliens, but they're not. You can look at clouds and find shapes in them and people don't think aliens made them. Some think that just because it is on another planet that aliens must have made it, but it doesn't mean that at all.

When people first noticed that it looked like a face they immediatly started thinking that aliens were behind it because they thought that it looked like an Egyptian pharoah. How could an alien that lived on Mars know what an Egyptian pharoah looked like? They are a completely different planet, millions of miles away. Even if it is just a regular face, not a pharoah, still how would aliens even know what humans looked like? And, say that they did know what we looked like, still why would they build this land form to look like us and not themselves? It makes absolutly no sense. If it really was aliens they would want to build of themselves, so they get some credit. There is no way they would of made it of a completely different species.

There is nothing special about this form other than the fact that it looks like a face. It is exactly like all the other forms on mars. Conspericy theorists want to say that we, NASA, know that it is from aliens and that we're just trying to keep it a secret. That makes even less sense then saying that aliens created it in the first place! If we could find something that was really built by aliens, that would be tremedously great for us. If we knew that it was built by aliens we would be overwhelmed by excitement, and we would let everyone know about it. The cold hard truth is that it is just like any other form. The fact that it looks like a face makes some people suspicous, and we get that. Who wouldn't want to know that their is life on other planets, I know I would be amazed if it was true, but it isn't. This is just a really cool looking land form, nothing else. Aliens had absolutly nothing to do with it.

When this face shaped land form was found, even the people on the ship wanted to think that it was made by aliens. It would be great for everyone, especially NASA, but they quickly had to come to reality and realize that it was just like the rest, it just had a really interesting shape. Some dreamers still would like to believe that aliens built this land form, but they to need to soon come into reality. There are so many of these forms on Mars already. Aliens wouldn't want to build a land form that looked like a human. If it was from an alien we would know, and we wouldn't keep it from you. All real evidence shows that aliens were not involved what so ever, but some would still like to believe they were.

""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."". This is saying that the natural landform is formed by shadows.

And another thing is that they went again to see if they could take a picutre again of the natural landform but, they had a better camera they would allow them to see better if it was true that the natural landform was true. "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 metters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo."".

One reason I think the face is a landform, is because the sand on that planet builds up and increases into a mountain. There are also astroids that strike the planet, making the planet have different size shapes on its surface. Also, there are tectonic plates to move the land.

One other reason I think it is a landform is because, if aliens were to create the enourmus structure, how would they do it and why would they do it? To me, there is no other explanation other than it was created by natural landforms. Also, whos to say that aliens are real or not?

If it was made up by aliens then why is it not looking like a face more and more when we look more in to it.

2997d0c,"Do you think The Face on Mars is natural? As a scientist at NASA I sure do! I think it is natural because we (NASA) released the pictures within a few days of taking them. Also, the pictures would show any alien markings. Finally, the story says that there are some of those formations on earth. I truly believe that it is a natural formation.

We, NASA, released pictures of The Face on Mars just a few days after we took them. Would we do that if we believed it was evidence of alien activity? Would we want to show that to the public, I don't think so! If we believed that it was alien related we wouldn't show the public and get them riled up. It would be nonsensical. I highly doubt that we would show the public if it was aliens.

Don't you think our top of the line cameras would show any alien markings? In the passage it even says each pixel from our camera is only 1.56 meters! That is a very large zooming ability! Our cameras are very expensive, and are top of the line. We use those cameras for the reason of seeing very small details like markings and any other little things. I really think our cameras would have picked up any alien markings, if there was any!

Finally, there are land formations like that on our own planet, earth! There are what we call mesas found all over the American West, which is the same things as the formation on mars. The mesas are formed from a lava dome. Also we know that something like that can happen on mars just like it can on earth. I think the landform is a mesa just like we have on earth.

Is The Face on Mars natural? I think so! I think that because NASA would not release pictures like that if they thought it was alien related!

29a7d43,"I love us humans, and our little species-wide neural shortcuts. One example of a ""shortcut"" is face recognitioon. Our brains tell us what is human by looking at the face. The brain does have some flaws in this, though, because we tend to see faces where there isn't one. One of the most notable examples is the face on Mars. There is no way the ""face"" on the red planet was made by aliens, because as previously stated, the brain sees faces where there aren't any, the ""face"" is a common occurane on Mars, a mesa, and any alien proof would be seen in recent pictures. All of the evidence points towards the obvious conclusion, and the most likely scenario is probably correct, as Occam's Razor points out.

To begin, the brain tries to recognize faces, and it is really good at it. It says, ""Yep, that's a face!"" and that's because humans are social creatures. We need to recognize others that will be able to support us and stay together, because in ancient times, that, along with our ability to think and reason, was what we had going for us. As one source that I forget the name of stated, ""Pretty much the only thing we can outsprint by bodylengths per second is vegetables."" We could make tools and weapons to support ourselves, but to be effective, we had to team up. And that is why we see a ""man in the moon"". We see the face by craters. This is just the same thing, our brains being awesome at seeing faces, but not at recognizing the lack of a body to go with them.

Also, the ""face"" is a common occurance on Mars, a mesa. It is just a landform. This is shown by the NASA saying ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West."" The ""face"" is just a landform. The most recent picture shows the mesa in much more detail, and the face starts to fade away as the resolution increases.

As stated before, the picture resolution increases with each attempt at an image, and still no alien civilization! The article states ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" If there was above-ground alien civilization, we would have seen it by these pictures. The logical conclusion for the illogical is ""What if they are underground?"" and this is a valid point until you look at it more closely. To ""sculpt"" this landform, the aliens would have to dig out surrounding land, and that is hard, not impossible, but hard to do. And as stated before, use Occam's Razor. Also, they would most likely have to have some way to see humans, because the chances of aliens on a different planet in a different environment evolving similar faces to ours seems a little far-fetched. They would have some sort of visible, surface-bound satillite dish or something similar to recieve the signal.

Some might argue, ""Well, NASA is just covering up life on Mars."" and to that arguement, I say ""Good job! You are so close to logic!"" because while NASA could cover up the truth, they wouldn't do so. It would be good for business to discover some ""sentient alien life"" because the NASA budget would skyrocket! Everyone would want to know ""What they look like? Do they have a language?"" et cetera. Also, if they wanted to cover it up, no matter how much it would improve NASA, they have to release images publicly. If they managed to do some fancy photoshopping and release the images, there are people skilled enough to undo those photoshops and also, photoshopping leaves some computer traces around on an image, and there are plenty of free online sites that will spot those traces and show anyone where and how those touch-ups were made.

The most obvious conclusion is probably the right one, and all evidence points towards just a natural landform. The brain's ability to detect faces, the frequency of those landforms, and the ability to see alien civilization, if any exists, in more recent pictures proves the point of those who follow logic though the tinfoil-hat warriors try to say otherwise.

So to there isn't any life form on Mars, actually the face compare to a butte or mesa. We compared the face to Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The face compares a lot to the butte and so that proves that the face was not formed by aliens. ",1,1,0.9284850358963013

While, some people think that the face on Mars is ""bona-fide evidence"" that there once was life there. NASA has defended that remark by saying that they wish that it was a mark of ancient civilization but, it's not. NASA has also made it a priority to photograph the face because, they felt as if it was ""important to the taxpayers"" to give them evidence that it wasn't an alien landform.

So, in 1998 they flew a shuttle over Cydonia, the face/lanform, for the first time to go take pictures of it. Thousands of people were waiting to see pictures of it. It had turned out to be just a landform ,like NASA had said, not an ancient lifeform. Many people disagreed with the pictures that NASA took because they had stated that it was cloudy during the time they had taken the pictures on Mars so, they couldn't really get a clear shot of the face. While NASA agreed with them that it was a cloudy time of year on Mars they are still sure that there has never been life on the planet.

While NASA hasn't changed there opinion because it is in fact just a landform. Many people still want good proof that it could quite possibly be acient civilization. So, they prepared to send up another. This time they sent it up on a cloudless summer day so that no-one could argue that the weather affected the pictures. NASA was right again. This time they took up a camera that zoomed in the structure and it didn't show anything new that would have meant that there has ever been any life there.

All together, these facts prove that it is just a landform. A scientist named Garvin was quoted saying ""That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The face is indeed just like a landform that we have here on Earth. Although the other side of this long running debate did have some evidence that might have made NASA think twice, there is still more proof that it is a landform.",4,1,0.861158013343811
29ff531,"there has been so many stories about aliens ,but are they real?.Imagine seeing something like an unmasking face on Mars would you think it was a alien or a natural landform?.

Well as you can see the scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa. Common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Accorrding, to the NASA a few days later unveiled the image for all to see. ""huge rock formation.... which resembles a human head..."". Formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. As said in paragraphs 2 and 3.

Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact. It could be a alien face but when do we usually see aliens. Sure there maybe other creatures out there but as paragraph 7 says"" when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time , Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

In conclusion , we would all want to belive that aliens are real and that the face on Mars was a alien but it wasnt. On the other side we have discovered an amazing face on Mars as us the NASA and Michael Malin have proven. The picture is not a alien as you can see from all the prof we found.",3,1,0.8724712133407593

Mosly the land form was owned by allies. The capition noted a Huge rock. NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The face on marz has became a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film. There must have been a drgee of suprise among missions contollersback at the jet propulison lab when the face apperared on their montions. RAdio talk shows says that the alies haunted the gorgoey stores checkout lines 25 years, some people think it wasnt always haunted. Missson again its not always easy to spot a face on the surfce. The people think when people go to space the alies thake them and put there faces on the surfsace and makes it all stay there.

Most people dont belive its the aliens that are doing this. in 2001 the image spans. 1.56 meters comapred to 43 meteres per pixel in the best viking photot. Most pictures you bring back often shows but mosly they never do the alies dont wnat people taking back what they did. On april 8th 2001 a cloud lesss summer day in cydonia marz golbal surveyor drew close enough for a second look. we had to roll out the spacecraft 25 dreggs to the center of the filed view. The team capturd an extardoiary photot using a good camra.

I think that its kinda cool that people go out there to see the faces on the plants. I would aloso like to see hown they would do that. i would bring home so many pictures of all the faces on the suface. It would rally be cool if they picture really shows. some people would really like to see the faces on the earth or surface. The most biggest of the people are when the people bring back lots of the pictures to show and to sell. when you look on the website to see what people had said about it when they went to see it.

The Face is a natural rock formation. Evidence such as a picture taken on April 8, 2001 shows that it is nothing more than a mesa which are common in that area of Mars.

The picture was taken with a camera that had a higher resolution than the camera used by the Viking 1 in 1976. The pixels in the image had a closer meter spread at 1.56 meters per pixel to the Viking 1 with 43 meters per pixel causing more of a blur effect.

Others say that the Face is an alien artifact. They say that us at NASA are covering up the fact that there is life on Mars. Another thing they say is that on April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of the Face the alien markings were hidden by the haze due to it being winter on Mars at the time.

The final thing to say on the matter is that the Face is a natural rock formation. The Face was not created by aliens. The pictures prove that it is natural. The fact that us at NASA say that the Face is natural doesn't mean aliens created it. Conspiracy theory disproved.",2,1,0.8954699635505676

Eighteen years after the face was discovered, we sent Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team to take a picture ten times sharper of the face. In the picture, It was revealed that it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Later, there was a second picture taken up close even more than before. There were no signs of alien existence around the landform.

It all started when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was on the planet and was snapping pictures,as it was snapping pictures it noticed a shadow of a humans face,in other words a big enormous head.

paragraph2:Mars is a planet anyone can travel too not just humans but martians and other strange creatures that we dont know about. Well it is just a natural landform because they got all of the evedience they needed to prove that it was no sign of an alien. Cydonia did everything they could to prove everyones suspicious but not everyone was satisfied they still thought that it was signs on mars that they saw a martian.

Paragraph3:In my opinion if i was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone i would kinda like go close to snap better pictures to prove innocents on my behalf to cover me and to prove everyones suspicious so it wouldnt have to be that big of an argument. They did a good thing by zooming the picture in three times bigger and all of the other objects in the picture,they saw clear so they had to see clearly that it wasn't an alien in the picture.

2a4ca7b,"Imagine you are a NASA scientist discussing the face seen on Mars with a person a person who thinks it could have been alien life form that created it. Do you think it was just a natural landform or do you believe in alien life form doing this? NASA believes it is just a natural landform. NASA made a discovering on Mars that they believe looks very much like a face though they say it is just a nartural landform many others disagree, there is not any life form on Mars, aliens are just theory, and it looks similar to the landform in west America Idaho Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain.

First, there is not any life form on Mars. NASA has not yet caught any living creature on Mars when observing Mars and taking pictures of it. They have not been able to find any other things to point toward life on the Red Planet. For example in the passage it says ""...you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...if objects in this picture like airplanes on the fround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack, you could see what they were!"". So this quote proves there is no life form on mars because they would have seen it.

Second, aliens are just a theory that has been around for years and years. The meth of aliens have been around for decades but still no one has ever seen one some may believe they have but mistakeing it for other objects or even seen them in their dreams and thought it was real maybe. In this example it shows that this is a strange find but could very well be just a landform ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first apperaed on JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" this was found in paragraph seven of the passage, saying there was no life form when they discoverd this picture of a natural landform.

Finally, some have said it looks like the natural landform MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho, west America. Like in this quote from the passage, "" That's lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."", proving it is just a landform and no more then that. Though this could open up another opportunity to discover is there lava or water on Mars.

Though NASA discovered this face and would of loved if it came from an alien

that was not the case, don't you agree? There is still no life form on Mars today, as for the theory of alien, and the Idaho plain land mark looked just like the landform on Mars, were all are fact to prove this was just a strange land mark of Mars. And now we know this thanks to NASA's research.",4,1,0.8360382318496704
2a76a2f,"Most people would like to think the ""Face on Mars"" is related to aliens in some way. However, that theory is highly unlikely. As in the in the article, the pictures from three different time periods, show different things, and each is more accurate than the other. It appears in the third picture (the most updated picture from 2001) that there is no face at all. It simply looks like a natural landform. The face was just shadows.

Even with the most updated and accurate picture from 2001, people still like to argue it could be a connection to alien life. Alien life has yet to be proven and is based off of theories, just like the face on Mars. These people are just ignoring the facts. My question is, why are people still basing there theory on an outdated and poor-pixlated picture when the newest one prooves its just a landform? I would like to think it has to do with fantasy. Most people get so stuck on something they wish were true just to make there life more entertaining, and most people like a little mystery as well. The thing is though that facts over-rule theories and perdictions.

According to the article, it says that with the newest picture, if there were something, we would've caught it in the picture. That is proof that it is only a landform. They even compare it to some of our landforms on earth, so I don't see how people still believe it could be something else. As I've adressed before, alien life isn't even prooven, so how could we be sure if this is connected to that all? We can't.

I would also like to adress shadows. In the first picture it had been said that they were only just shadows. There have been many instances of when we've seen shadows on objects and thought it looked like something else. This case isn't any different than that. We base most things on what we see rather than what it really is. It tells us in the article people have put the face in things such as movies, books, and magazines. For some reason people tend to feed into those things rather than whats really true. That goes along with the thing I said earlier about how people will believe what they want and pick the thing thats more exiting over whats logical.

There are facts and there are theories. Facts are what tell us that the 'Face on Mars"" isn't anything alien related just a natural landform. Kind of a dissapointment really.",4,1,0.8075506091117859

The rock formation

is a mesa the NASA came acrossed

The picture actually shows is the Martain equivilent of a butte or mesa land form common around the American west.

The head shape is just like a volcano it looks like it is a huge rock that comes up just like a volcano.

Then once a clear shot was given it was shadowed as a face but really it was just a huge natural land form.

There are probly all types of land masses that might look like a face, on planet earth or on other planets that we have not found yet might have faces exactly like this one

so there is no way to say a alein created this when the NASA has came across this more than once.

the only reason the NASA paied attention to the land formation is because it has a face on it that was made by a shadow.

That is why aleins did not make the land mass because volcanoes come up to pionts and rise as so due the land formation and some volcanoes have faces as well as the land formation.

So no this is just a natural landfom created by outerspace and gravity.              ",3,1,0.7958978414535522

By looking at the images from 1976 and 1998 I can see where someone might mistake it for a humaniod face. The images are a little blurry and because of this you can see what appears to be eyes, a nose and a mouth.

Upon closer inspection of the 2001 image you can see it is just a natural landform such as a mountain that formed from the wind blowing sand over the years. NASA has done scientific research to prove to you that the Face isn't really a face, it's just a mountain that resembles one.

There have been many claims of extraterestrial life forms on Mars. Most of these claims lack evidence. There may still be life on Mars, but we have yet to gather any real evidence. I assure you that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform that shadows had an effect on to make it appear to resemble a monument. If it wasn't for the high resolution camera that was used to take the 2001 image of the Face, we might still believe it to be an extraterestrial monument.      ",3,1,0.8608153462409973

This could just be are pollution is spreding not just in the air but even in space. Or Mars could just be doing what earth does every amount of years earth changes in like the land-scap mars land-scap could just be changing.

On Earth we have weird stuff happen a lot like symbols in corn feilds, some people think they see flying space ships some people are just crazy aliens don't exist. We don't have any proof that aliens exist like just because some cows go missing or found dead doesn't mean they didn't just leave or a wild animal didn't kill them. I don't know how to explaine the corn feilds but the ""flying space ship"" is just a jet or plane nothing big and if people say other people have been kinapped by aliens or saw some aliens they would be lying because aliens don't exist.

Earth today has so many pollution problems rigth now it's just not funny but are pollution could somehow start to spread to other planets because we have air pollution. Air pollution can spread pretty easy so when we like have rocket and go to a different planet we may bring different substances to that planet it's not use to. Or just how we went to the moon the pollution we brougth to the moon could have spreaded all over the galxay.

So we all know how the Earth changes once every speacial year or years but were use to that cause we know it's going to happen. So now there is a new change but not to planet Earth but to Mars it's weird but it's just a planet. Like are it may have some new changes may not this doesn't mean it has to do with aliens. We have traveld or seen with are cameraas in space so many planets but never one trace of aliens or any life form so that means aliens aren't real.

So in conclusion with all the evidence we got from prior knowleged and reading this article there are no other life form on anyother planet just Earth. Also aliens don't exist all the weird things that happen in the world or on different planets all happen because humans do something wrong to the earth.

Its like the man it the moon it is just a landscape it is nothing big at all. By saying that it is an alien people today would probally believe that it is true they would go crazy.

The face on Mars is most likely a volcano, a mountain, or a valley. Meteors have hit Mars so it takes some of the rocks and land away and it could happen to look like a face made aliens, but it cant be because it is a natural land formation of rocks.

Many people would disagree because they believe that Mars could have living lifeforms. Mars cant have living things on it because of the air being as toxic as it is. People think that there is a possability for things to be able to live on Mars, but there is no way for life to sustain on Mars because there is no where to grow food and raise animals to eat.

The mystery of the face on Mars, true or false? The face on Mars is just a mesa landform. This is proven by Nasa's Mars Global Surveyor when it took a picture of it with a camera that had a pixel span of 1.56 meters.

Some may disagree with this because they believe scientist are hiding this ""consiracy theory"" from them. An evidence to prove that their is

life on Mars.

However, after reading this prompt your opinion may change.

First, it is just a landform because of all the evidence's collected from the article. In paragraph 12, it clearly states that ""What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"". In 1976 the picture looked like it was a face of a human becuase of the camera's quality. The camera's from 1976 to now have evolved. "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"". This shows that the quality of the pictures differences. Last, if scientist were to really hide this ""conspiracy thoery"" from us it wouldn't make a difference. In fact NASA would be benifiting from it becuase how it would appear in news, radio talk shows, books, etc. Paragraph 7

"" There was no alien monument after all"".

Next, now some believe that this conspiracy theory is a secret hidden from us by NASA. They think the face is evidence to prove life on Mars. This is because in paragraph 8 it states that "" The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian lattitude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet"". They believe that this may have caused the face to be hidden in the clouds. Also another reason they may believe it is a face is becuase they might have seen something that had false information on the web. This might be becuase in the text it states that "" The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon"".

Last but not least, now that you've read this prompt is the face on Mars really a face? The face turns out to be just a landform on Mars. The pictures from 1976 were unclear tooken with a camera that had 43 meters per pixel. Then in 2001, NASA retook the picture with a camera with that had 3 times bigger pixels than the one from 1976.

As you see, throught the years, the world has devolped better technology. We've made better cameras and have found out a way to make things even more clear. In 1976, the picture appears blurry. It doesnt look focused on it at all. So what I am trying to say is, that this could not have been clear at first and that they didn't know what they were seeing at first. It could have been there the whole time.

The texts states what the picture actually shows. It says, ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West."" This is a landform. Garivn states that it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. People have seen this types of landforms on Earth too, and there is no aliens on Earth. they have said it's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa.

In the text, it says that scientists figured it was just another Martin mesa. They even said it was common around that area, Cydonia. The only thing that was different was, that it had shadows around it. That is completly normal for shadows to appear.

Many scientists have seen this face as life on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists have said there is life on Mars,and NASA is trying to hide it from the people. In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the face, but they revealed there was no face to be seen. There was only a natural landform. Scientists have began to lose hope of ever seeing the face again. If they were ever able to find the face again, they would have money to do more investigation. Although there were no extratrrestrial beings, people still believed the face would soon appear again. Scientists are still trying to look for ways to explain it all.

Reasearchers are still looking for the face on Mars. Scientist Jim Garvin states, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes an the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were !"" He is comparing airplanes, pyramids,and small shacks to the face which is no longer there. This statement proves that the face is a natural landform. Many landforms on Earth form then after years or even decades, they decay down to nothing. Although landforms are always forming, they are also being destroyed. Without oxygen on Mars, there is no way the face is able to survive.

Although the face is not real and is a natural landform, researchers will stop at nothing to prove it is real. Conspiracy theorists are still trying to find the truth. Little do they know the truth has been revealed, the face is just a natural landform.",2,1,0.8749043345451355
2c21b01,"Face The Landform?

Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.

First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that ""face"" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.

After scientists did a little research on their own, ""The Face"" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.

Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.

So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.            ",4,1,0.8737947940826416
2c45808,"Twenty five years ago something very uncommon happened on our planet Mars. NASA sent a shuttle taht can take pictures of anything, NASA sent the shuttle out into space. The shuttle NASA sent out was called ""Viking 1"". Viking 1 was a shuttle that took (past tence) pictures of plantes. NASA sent the shuttle out to look for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. As the shuttle taking pictures it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. The Human face had a enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. Threw the cameras it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Those are some little details about the ""Human Face"".

Even though i'm a scientist at NASA, some of my friends who were also scientist we all agreed it was probably it was just another Martian mesa, they were common around Cydonia, but this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dissusing the ""Face"" with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. I was telling him (John) we unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" But now that the word got out people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. He was also saying ""Its evidence that evidence that NASA would rather hide."" Me personally believed the Face was an alien artifact.

And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so friends Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera which we called (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos. We were very anxious to see the picture... the picture revealed ... like we said a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

Everyone wasn't satisfied. The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98 which was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camrea on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

So then I ordered mission controllers to look again. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that looks straight down and scans teh planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips.

April 8, 2001 coudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough fro a second look. They had to roll the Space craft 25 degrees to center the Fce in the field of view. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking photo. Meaning in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there we objects in this pictures like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks youll know where they were.

The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. So they we never alien sights. Even though John never blieved what i said.                     ",3,1,0.8298324346542358
2c8ea49,"The face on Mars wasn't created by aliens, in fact it has no connection to alien life form at all! When the face was first discovered no one had really known much about it so people started hopping to conclusions before anything could be proven or tested. That is until NASA started looking into this ""face on Mars"". The face is actually a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. That's it- simply a rock formation but the shadows casted upon the crevices gives the strange formation the appeal of a human face. When people began to become even more skepical, on April 8, 2001, NASA had the Mars Global Surveyor draw close enough to snap another picture of the face. The day was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. NASA's serveyor camera had taken a crisp photo of the face in highest resolution. ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel."" so you can discern things in a digital images three times better than the pixel size. So NASA, and the rest of the world, had a more clear and better picture of the face everyone was talking about. Although the face may seem strange, it could be a rather common landform for Cydonia. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" Although this one may seem to stick out from the rest, it could merely be the shadows playing tricks on the human mind. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The landform may very well be common around Mars, it's merely the shadows ghosting around the landform that causes it to look like a face! So in reality, there is no alien life form connected to this rock formation at all! ",3,1,0.9000168442726135
2c9e52a,"If you want to believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens, that is fine, but we have evidence that it was not. The reason behind this is that like a lot of parts of Earth, it all naturally happened. Even if we find a clearer picture we have comfirmed in 2001 that it was just another natural landform And in the more clear picture, this face is the same as buttes or mesas commonly fond in the American West.

As we have been looking for more evidence we have gotten clear picture one after one, just to show that there was nothing left behind from aliens at the time. That was just the beginning. If we really have found a ancient artifact, then we would have started collecting small bits and pieces to examin them. Now, lets say that we did find that aliens created these lanndforms. We probably would have let more pictures to be seen to show proof of what we found.

Yes, there was also a thing during our winter where that everything on Mars is also hazy so that could be why we have been left to conclusion that it just naturally happened. However, if the monument gets abandoned every once in awhile then there could tools and items left back at it. If a landform was man made or in this case alien made, then there would be mistakes made, changes every once time.

As in an article that was read not that long ago, Jim Garvin says that the face on Mars looks about the same height as a Middle Butte in Snake River Idaho. This means that it was no matter what others say, it is just a natural landform that has just happened to look like a face. As from what Garvin said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

For that being so, the face is not an alien monument. The landform just has happened to be there and look like some face. Which if you still want to believe in the fact it could an alien thing that is fine. We have no alien evidence at all. ",3,1,0.8678932189941406

Plus we know that it is to hot for there to be living creatures.

Most all of us have has known that mars broke away from the sun that is why it is so hot there. Mars is a big hit in movies, books, magazines, and talk raidio shows.

Some of the people that has went to Mars have taken pictured of what looks like faces in the outer layer of the planet.

How we knew Mars is off of the sun is that it is close to it and it looks identical in almost all the ways possible.

Mars is called the red planet cause of its enormous amount of red on it.

which leads to say it is from the sun.

Plus it is close to 100+ degrees on the planet plus the heat of the sun doesn't help that at all.

Researcher still wanna way to find out how to make it where people can live on any of the planets.

But there is one problem there is no oxygen up in space so those up there would die in a matter of seconds.

I think Mars could be a bad planet to keep going on cause there are more things thhat can go wrong up there. They risk lives every time they r up in space.

If one thing is done incorrect the hole thing fails and then some lives amy be lost.

That is all i have to say about this topic of Mars.                   ",1,1,0.6282705068588257
2cd5385,"For someone who does not believe in aliens, this is only but a mere coincidence. We have no facts to prove that it WAS made by aliens, furthermore there being a whole civilization of aliens living on mars. There are many landforms as this one on Mars, and even on Earth, that happen to show some type of face, or object that would rather look man-made or even ""alien"" made. Just because there is a landform that has a shape, and look of a face, doesn't neccessarily mean that there is a life-form living on Mars. For there to be some type of life-for on Mars, yes, it would most benefit NASA, by finding out what is that life-form, how its living, and so on. But for someone to think that alien life-forms made this landform of a face, you can't really say that aliens have done so without having the proper information that shows, ""aliens"" have done so.

In 1976, from the photograph, we can say that yes, it does look like a face. But at this time, technology wasn't at it's highest. Since technology hadn't been as high tech as it is now, we could assume that, of the photo were taken now, yes, it'd be much more different, more defined. More so, there had been more photos taken on April 5th, 1998, with photos sharper than the original, being said that there had been no alien monument after all.

To conclude this argument, you could still go on saying how aliens are real, and how they created this landform. But in reality, no one has the facts to prove that an alien life-form had created this landform. No one has the facts to prove there are alien civilizations on Mars. I only say this because there has not yet been facts, or any information involving alien-life forms or ancient civilizations on mars. Maybe in the future, there will be signs of some type of life-form on Mars, or very odd, peculiar objects that we may find somewhat weird, or, out of the ordinary. It is only, but a matter of time before NASA does find something very odd and out of the ordinary, on any planet, in our solar system.",4,1,0.8382272720336914
2cde373,"The object in the picture is not an alien artifact, because land forms on mars that look funny are caused by shadows, the picture quality was not good, and the camera on the last time could of saw buildings and even planes.

The object in the picture was not a alien artifact, because the land on mars has many hills called Martian mesa. A Martian mesa is like a sand dune it is mound of sand and dirt, so for this to be a alien artifact is very unlikely. These mesas are very common on mars, because it says,""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" This shows that it was just another mound of sand and dirt that had a wierd shadow that made it look like a face.

The second piece of evidence is that, the picture quality was not very clear in the first two pictures. In the first picture they did not have very high HD cameras like they did in 2001. In the first picture it is very blurry and not clear witch gave it the look of a face. In the second picture it was a cloudy day and the picture did not come in clear, still giving it the look of a face. In the last picture it was a perfect day for it and scientest had the camera ready they zoomed it in all the way and where ready for the picture, and when they looked at it it showed nothing but a dirt mound.

The last piece of evidence is that on the last time to the picture could of shown buildings, roads etc. In the last picture the camera scientest where using could of picked up any small buildings, roads, and any that was close to it, but it did not. This means that their is no life on mars to create a mound that looks like a face. Their for their is no alien life on mars.

The evidence shows states that their is no alien life on mars and that it was just a bad picture along with a mound the caused a wierd shadow that caused this look of a face.        ",3,1,0.7628278732299805

First off, while some skeptics and conspirac theorists believe NASA would like to hide any evidence, defenders of the NASA budget say that they wish there was an ancient civilation. More than that, NASA would have no logical reason not to inform the public of major discoveries, such as discovering life on another planet and there is no evidence to prove or explain why they would want to hide such important information.

Secondly, while some people consider the formation to be some sort of alien structure, NASA considers the ""face"" to be nothing more than a mesa, which is a logical thing to think considering the fact that mesas aren't uncommon on Earth either. Jim Gavin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, even compared the mesa on Mars to one here on Earth saying ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte ine hte Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" may be interesting to look at, but the fact that some consider it to look like a human face is mere coincidence.

The article even says that it is just a natural land formation nothing else. Cameras have proved it and so have telescopes. It is not an alien monument.

The second time they looked at the face they used really good cameras and telescopes to see what it actually was!

One reason is the shadowing of the landform, the second is that there are clouds and clouds could tamper with the camera, and the third s that there have been multiple pictures and only one shows a face.

The first reason is shadowing. When ever you look at something you could think its someone or something else. This can be because shadowing. Sometimes you cant see all the features, or shadows make there own. This is the case with the Face on Mars. There might be crater in the mesa that could look like eyes far away and a curve could make a mouth shape. ""Only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"".

""...Revealing... a natural landform"". These both give evidence on how there was a change in shadow on the mesa.

The second is the clouds. Some clouds on the red planet could have gotten in the way and make it look more like a face then a mesa. ""... April '98 - a cloudy time of year for the Red planet. This gives evidence that there are more clouds then ususal on the Red Planet.

The third thing is the amount of pictures. THere have been multiple pictures of the mesa. And only one looks like a face. The other pictures show a mesa or a butte type area.

The Face on Mars is a mystery because we dont know if the face is there or is it shadows. In my opinion I think that the face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. the face has also been seen as a pop icon, it has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Defenders of the national budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Maybe there is life maybe there's not who knows for sure.

Eighteen long years after Viking missions, we sent up the Global Surveyor. Once the it was in place for a good shot we took it ten times which were sharper than the viking photos.

Why do you think that there is alien life on Mars, it is just so unlikely that I am surprised that someone as smart as you would believe in something so crazy.

Was the Face created by aliens or was it just a natural landfrom on the region of the Red Planet Cydonia?

So, many question about the Face and how it was created.

But, I think personally it was a natural landform from the planet ,but my friend thinks it was created by aliens.

In my passage, im going to talk about and convince you and my friend that the Face was made by a natural landform.

The Face, was a natural landform, I know this for a fact. I know this because on April 5, 1998, when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over the Red Planet Cydonia.

They caputured a picture ten times sharper then the original Viking photos.

When, they caputured the right photo the first image appeared on a JPL website and it revealed that the Face was natural landform after all.

They didn't find any alien monument that would lead to the Face being created by aliens.

After, all those picture some people were sill not satisified people still thought it was created by aliens.

So, the mission controlled prepared another look to make sure that it was created by a natural landform.

Then on April 8,2001 it was a cloudless summer day on the Red Planet.

The Mars Global Surveyor drew a closer look which lead to what the picture actually showed.

The picture was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa some landforms that were common around the America West.

A lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.

So, you see the Face was really a natural landform from the beginning.

After, all that research,pictures,credits, and even second thoughts it still came out to be created by a natural landform not a alien.

Thats my opinion and I supported it.                                                                                 ",3,1,0.8587635159492493
2e6c099,"What is the Face on Mars? Is it an extraterrestrial being or form?

The Face on Mars is not something alien like, it is not an Egyptian Pharoah, and it is not anything other than a simple rock formation that was shaded as though to look like a face by coincidence. It is a landform. As a matter of fact, it is much like those you can find here on Earth, and it is normal as you and I.

How would finding an ancient civilization on Mars be something we would want to hide? It wouldn't! In fact, it would be amazing if we could discover something so wonderful. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars (5). If we were able to find something so incredible as that, it would be very beneficial to the NASA program. There's absolutely no reason to hide something so intriguing and beneficial from anyone!

Now, I see where the confusion may come in. When the first picture was captured back in 2001, it seriously resembled a human head! Sadly, the sensation of finding something new lasted only for a short period of time, because it was soon ruled to be just another rock formation, common enough around Cydonia (2). Shadows can do funny things, just like they did in this situation. For a short period of time they had us believing that perhaps there was something to be found on Mars! We went to Cydonia three times, and I promise you there is nothing out of this world about the Face on Mars.

So, you might be wondering what was found on those trips back to Mars. Well, let me tell you. On the second trip back to Mars to capture another picture of the Face, it was found that it was simply, like I said, a plain old rock formation (7) . Since some people were not satisfied with the photo, we went back to take another one on a clear day,using the camera's absolute maximum resulotion, and got the best picture taken of the Face (8). The picture proves that the Face is no more extraordinary than some of the landforms we have here on Earth.

Now, I know there for a minute we really thought we had something. Too bad that after all the research was done, it turned out to be just another everyday kind of thing. I hope you realize now that the Face on Mars is simply a mesa, a rock formation, a land form, and that we have no reason to hide any discoveries or advances. Finding an ancient civilization would be wonderful. Maybe someday we will, but the Face on Mars is not it.  ",4,1,0.8574455976486206

The ""face"" is a rock mond. The shadows caused by the sun make the illusion of human features. The ""face"" is similar to some locations on Eath as stated by the cheif scientist. The ""face"" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa.

NASA is a program that would like more funding than already grated. If there is a major space break through NASA, would be grated a funding boost. NASA would not hide the sign of life from the public's eyes. NASA, most likely, would want to promote life in space.

Now in conclusion, the ""face' is a rock mond and NASA would not life to hide alien life. Now that I have covered the topic what is your view on the face on Mars?",3,1,0.7774902582168579
2e8fd2b,"Your eyes can play tricks on your mind when looking at something you don't know if it is really there. Anything can be created. Also anything can be a lie. I'm argueing that the face on mars is just a natural landform.

I have numerous of claims about the face on planet mars to be a natural landform. First off how de we know that aliens are real, has anyone actually touch or seen one in real life. Then we have craters falling everywhere that must of happened to fall and make a face on planet mars. Then what if the rover on mars is messed up and the camers are not working correctly. Finally have scienctist ever tried using diffrent times in the day.

The article ""Unmacking the Face on Mars"" has many evidence to support my claims. One od the things the article said is that "" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

Another thing the article stated "" Afew days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving illusion of eyeys, nose, and mouth."" After that they said "" Thousands of anxious on JPL website revealing... natural landform.

2e922a8,"Mars has many landforms, but there is a particular one that is peculiar. The landfrom is known as The Face. The Face was spotted by a space surveyor in 1976 and has been a mystery to the world ever since. Some people say that this landform was made by alien life on Mars, but with facts from NASA and other sources you could see that those people are wrong.

The Face has had many theories made up about how it was made and if it is even real. One of these theories is about how or who created it. This theory is about how NASA is hiding the fact that the face was made by some type of alien lifeform, which logically makes no sense at all. Finding life on another planet would bring in a gargantuan amount of money for NASA so it would seem completely illminded to hide something like this from the people. NASA can only wish they knew about an alien lifeform.

With this new discovery people and scientists demanded for more proof on how it was made. Throughout the knowing of this landform three pictures were taken of it. The first of pictures was in 1976 when they first found it and camera quality was not very good. With not a clear image, and the need for answers, NASA sought out for another picture and got one during a cloudy winter day in 1988. This picture did come out clearer than the other but still was not perfect for scientist and people to be one-hundred percent sure how it was made. So the wait began to get another picture. Finally in two-thousand-one NASA used a new, high-resolution, three-dimensional camera to take an outstanding clear photo of what they concluded to be a mesa, common in the American West, just with the physical pheatures of a human face.

In conclusion this outstanding land form on Mars had the world stuck asking this question, ""Is there alien life on mars?"" The Face was a mystery to science for almost thirty years only to be proven to be just another landform on Mars. To conclude, this landform is nothing more than a naturally occuring lava dome.

2eb95cd,"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 took a photo of a landform that resembled a face. This excited the public. NASA has gone back to that place twice and taken higer defenition photos to make sure that it is not a face or some monument made by aliens. They have fond that it is a common landform, a mesa or butte. If it were more, NASA would tell the public right away. News of life on Mars would excite the public, and provide NASA with funding for future explorations.

The first photo of the landform was taken in 1976 by Viking 1. Each pixel in the photo represents 43 meaters. It is difficult to see deitalies in this photo. NASA believed that it was thier duty to make sure this was not a sign of extraterestrial life. In 1998, Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper than the original. This picture showed more deatail, but the public was not satisfied. In 2001 NASA took another photo of the spot. In this photo a pixel is equal to 1.56 meters. This image is so sharp that if anything unusual were there, you could see it.

Mesas are a common landform in that area. Cydonia, where the Face is located has lots of other landforms like mesas and buttes. Simaler landforms are also found on earth. Landforms come in all different shapes and sizes, and this one happens to resemble a face. That is not unusual, we like to find thing that look like other things. For example you might see a cloud and say it looks like a bunny. Likewise we see a landform and say it resembles a face.

The Face, ""a huge rock formation...resembles a human head"", but this is pure coincedence. the shape of the formation forms shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. NASA has taken very detailed photographs to make sure there is not alien life. The Face on Mars is a mesa or butte, a common formation. If there was life on Mars NASA wouldn't hide it, it would excite people about space and provide money for future explorations.",4,1,0.8121293783187866
2ebe52d,"I think that the Face is just a oddly shaped rock, it probably just got there from sandy winds and erotion taking place on a mesa and that is what made it to be like that from, from my experience with the Bible it says there is nothing else in the universe to do harm to the earth, except for sin and satin. The Lord thy God will never but something like that in the universe to do us harm.

From th excerpt it says that at that time it was a windy mounth on Mars and from that I think that it got there from erosion, for atleast a couple hundred years it would had to be wearing away, because that huge of a rock can not possibly get worn away that fast but i guess since we found it like this a rock on Mars in the Crydonia and some how it lookes like a face, and over to the next century it would probably change and look like somthing else a new shape it would not stay like that for long. But it would be a cool conspicury to think that aliens make a cool looking rock formation of a Egyphian Pharoah known as the Face.

Also from the excerpt says that it a a butte or a mesa that got eroded away over time, and also if there was a alien life form on Mars we could see it because we have this high packed pixle camera that can take a photo of Mars and we can see them and there homes on our monitors the camera is called the Mars Global Suveryor an dby the intension of that shuddle we can see all things big or small.",2,1,0.7044652700424194
2f435d9,"Have you ever heard of ""the Face""?

The Face is something that is a landform on Mars that looks just like a face.

Some people think that the face was created by Aliens.

This isn't true.

There is much evidence that this is false.

It is a natural landform.

So question is what would you say if you were a scientist at NASA that knows that ""the Face"" is a natural landform and you were talking to someone that thinks that ""the Face"" was created by Aliens.

3 reasons that I would mention are that the face is made of rock, pictures show that it is a landform, and that it looks like landforms like a mesa or a butte.

""The"" Face is made of rock.

The article ""Unmaskng the Face on Mars"" states that...

""A few days later NASA unvelied the image for all to see.

The caption noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'""

Aliens didn't create rock.

And as the essay clearly shows ""the Face is obviously made of rock.

So that is part of the proof that ""the Face"" is a landform.

You can also tell that the Face is a landform through pictures.

Another reason that ""the Face"" is a landform is that the pictures show that it is a landform.

The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" shows pictures that show that ""the Face"" is clearly a landform.

In the pictures you can tell that this is a landform.

""The Face"" also looks like a mesa or a butte.

They are so many reasons that ""The Face is a landform.

Another one of the reasons is that ""the Face"" looks exactly like a mesa or a butte.

The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" states that...

""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.

'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'""

This also definitely proves that ""the Face"" is a landform not something that Aliens created and left there for some reason.

God created everything the way it is and for a purpose.

He put that rock landform thing there for a reason to show us how powerful God is and that he can do anything.

God created the world just how it is and that is how he wants it with His ""intelligent design""

We talked about how since ""the Face"" is made of rock, pictures show that it is a landform, and how it looks like landforms that it is a lanform.

This is what I would tell someone who thought that Aliens created ""the Face"".

Aliens didn't create ""the Face"".

God did for a purpose using His ""intelligent design"".

He did this to show us that He is very powerful and that He can do anything.

I hope that this will help strengthen a lot of people's Faith in God.

By writing this essay I hope to do more than just answer the prompt and get a good score.

I hope to also inform people about God and what He can do.                              ",3,1,0.8603169322013855

Everyone belived it to be a face of an alien, but NASA said it's just a face on Mars.

The face on Mars has become a popular icon. It has starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines and more! Some people think the face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. The face, is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98.

Here are my three examples that prove that its just a mesa. First there are mesas on Earth and in pictures fom Mars theres a lot. Second NASA took pictures of the mesa in 2001 and used ""high resolution images and 3D altimetry"" to show what it really looks like, and it doesnt look like a face. Lastly it would be beneficial to NASA for them to say its aliens.

One reason why it's just a mesa is, theres lots of mesas on Earth and Mars. An example of this would be ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". This is why its not a face but just a mesa.

Secondly NASA re-took photos of the ""face"". In the picture its a lot clearer then the one took in 1976. They did this by using ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry"" to clear the picture up. This is another reason why its not a alien made object but a mesa.

Lastly it would be beneficial for NASA to say that it was aliens. it would beneficial to them because people would be giving more money to them to try and find the aliens. this is yet another reason why it's not aliens.

To conclude these are the reasons why its not aliens. NASA would get more funding if they said it was aliens. They took a clearer picture of it in 2001 and it proved it wasnt a face.

This is a natural landform that is just a rocky small hill that has shadows cassing down on the hill to look like a face. There is not a living thing on Mars because scientist show there was nothing living or any plants on Mars. So how could the face on Mars be mad? It was a natural landform. This landform has been forming for awhile but the shadows come now and then. When the scientist saw the face of a human on Mars it was just luck that the shadow was cassing down on the face at that time.

Mars dosen't have any living things on the planet so how could people belivie it was made by something living? Scientist can prove there was nothing that had made the rocky hill, and they did. The only thing that could of made this rocky hill is natural landorm. Shadow casses down on the rocky hill to give it an ''illusion of eys, nose, and mouth''.

If there was life on Mars NASA would have found it by now because it would benefit them. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (Pg 5) So therefor the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because of the amount of pictures taken of Mars and the face, the amount of time taken to research the Face and all of the NASA people saying it resembles natural landforms that are on Earth.

First off we know that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because of all the pictures that were taken. If there was any alien life of any kind on Mars, NASA would have caught it. In the article it says, ""'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" (Pg 10) The author of the article went into even more detail and said, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplans on the ground or Egytian- style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'""(pg 11) This explains how good the camera quality is and how they wouldn't be able to miss anything.

Including the amount of picture evidence against life on Mars and the fact that the Face was not made by extraterrestrials, the amount of time spent researching the face by NASA clearly shows they know what they're talking about. The first picture of the face was taken in 1976 and then it was a major hit and they took another picture 12 years later in 1998. Then again after that in 2001. Also in the article it says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camer (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"" (pg 7) This quote from the article shows to what extent NASA researchers went to to find out more about the Face.

As if there is not already a bunch of reasons why the face on Mars is just a landform, a group of people are agreeing with NASA's decision that the face is just a natural landform. According to the article it says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" (Pg 2) Also stated in the article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivelant of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of idaho,' says Garvin."" Those quotes in the article are proof that those same types of landforms happened here on Earth as well and the ones here were not made by aliens.

In conclusion the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If there was aliens on Mars making landforms then NASA would definetely use that for publicity and to make the taxpayers happy. However there are no aliens on Mars making landforms and NASA knows this because of the time they have taken to research this along with the amount of pictures taken with high quality cameras and the resemblance of the landform to landforms on Earth.

Others thinks that it is just a resemble of a human head by a shadow.

I'am a scientist at NASA, and i am trying to explain that the face that everyone saw on the planet Mars was not created by aliens. It was created by naturel landform. There are many clues that the face was created by natural landform. Also many people can disagree with me, but I will prove to you that it was not created by aliens.

Many people thought that the face was created by aliens because at the time they did not have much eveadince of it was real or not. They thought that unusal shadows made it look like an Egyptin Pharaoh. We then showed people the pictures of the so what called face. It became a big hit everywhere, and people loved it. Some people thought it led to maybe living things being there. It then became an acient civlazation on mars.

In about April 5, 1998 they sent another ship out to take more adavnced pictures. These fine pictures would be much sharper, and they would capture more evedince. 1,000s of people waited to see what the fastinting pictures would bring a new. It revealed a natural landform and there came to be no alien monument after all. Many people were disapointed. They wanted to belive that it was real. Well, I am here to tell you that it is not real.

As you can tell there was a lot of dispute going on. Some people did not want to belive that it was not real. They wanted to keep trying. They then wanted to take a second look. The poeple wanted to make sure that we did not miss anything. We had an extraordinary photo that had pixel spans that were 1.56 meters. That was much better compared to1976 when the yfirst took the picturses.

What the picture actually showed was land forms that were common around the Amercian West.

Now do you see why the face was not created by aliens. Yes, maybe at one point in time it seemed like it could of been real, but all in the end it was not. It just took a little explaning and evidence over the photographs. In my opoion it would have been pretty amazing to of been that way. I guess some things just do not happen like that, and maybe some things happen for a reason.

In the following paragraphs I will state reasons helping you undertstand that the pictures effect everything and that it wasnt created by aliens.

The pictures that you have seen are very old. Most of the pictures you have seen where taken from 1976-2001. These pictures have really bad graphics. Things that are old are usaually harder to understand and comperhend. Its hard to see old things clear. Advances in technology have helped us see older things a lot more clear. We can fully understand things from the past now.

The cameras we use today have a lot better grapics. Back then their images could only span 43 meters per pixel. Today our cameras can span 1.56 meters per pixel which is a lot better. This helps us see pictures a lot more clear. We took pictures of the of the face and could see certain things the older cameras couldn't see.

In the new pictures if there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids we would easily see them. There wasn't any of these things. What the picture of the face showed was equivalent to a butte or mesa. It looked like landforms found in the American West. It reminds people of the

Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

All the new pictures we have help us undertstand and see things more clear. We now know that it wasn't created by aliens. Its just a simple butte or mesa thats no very special besides the fact that it kind of looks like a face. It reminds people of a Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This face has nothing to do with aliens.",4,1,0.7702522277832031
308f712,"The face on mars could not be an alien monument. You may argue that it was made by an ancient civilization, how would they know we had a lower resolution camera on the orbiting to make it in a way that the shadows would produce a face. Even on a cloudy day, the high resolution images of the martian mesa did not look like a face any more.

The details showen proves the fact that it is a natural land form simular to the ones ones on earth. Jim Garvin stated,""It reminds me most of middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

Useing his rule of thumb, the higher resolution shows more details of the face. So if there is aliens, how come we dont even see evidence of buildings around them? If it was built, a monument like that would have take time to build. In turn liveing accomadations would be needed for the workers and the pictures show none.

Although you may beleve that there is life on mars, please acumulate more proof before saying that it is a fact.

Some people think it was made by aliens and other people are logical and say it is a natral land form. I think it is just a land form because you can duscern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, we havent found anything else, and it look like some of the landforms here on earth.

First of all, in paragraph 11 it says that as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image up to 3 times its size. This helps prove it wasnt made by aliens because they cal close in on the picture and they didnt find anything else around it like other sculptures or houses or anything. therefore, it was either really old or just a land form.

Also, we haven't found anything else on the planet. If aliens made that dont you think they would have made other things and if they did wouldnt they also be there. It is not likely the face is an artifact because there should be more and if it was made by aliens and they had more it is unlikely that they made them and only that one is still there.

It does look a lot like what the agyptians made so if there were aliens they would probably be capable of doing that but it also looks like some of the landforms we have here on earth. Garvin even says in paragraph 12 ""It reminds me most of middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. hat's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated masa about the same height as the face on mars.""

In conclution, It is just a natural landform that happens to look like a face. We havent found anything else on the planet and the ppicture doesnt have anything in it like a home. Also it looks like some of the landforms here on earth, we have some natural things that look wierd so why cant mars? The face was not made by aliens. ",3,1,0.8762674927711487

First off is the logical thinking portion. In the region of Cydonia mesas are incredibly common.

Now this particular mesas is oddly shapped, I will give it that, but it is just a mesa. What gives it human fetures is just the shadows. Just look at 1976 Viking one photograph. You can clearly see shadows Just look slightly below it, you can see a long shadow protruding from the mesa. Now on the flip side, look at the picture captured on 1998 when it was cloudy out and there were no shadows at all. The image just makes it look like a weird rock, not like a human face at all.

While still on the topic of the photographs, the one snapped on 2001 also proves that the so called ""Face on Mars"" is really just a mesa becouse of not the actual formation, but the surronding area. It was taken by a very high quality camera. In fact, it's pixles spanned 1.56 meters whereas the best Viking photograph the pixles spanned 43 meters. That ment that you could zoom in around the area of the mesa to scan if there was any other evidence of alien life. So scienteists and analysts could scan the sourrounding area for pyramids or buildings, but they found absolutly nothing that would sugest that aliens are present in the region.

Lastly, lets all say that the so called face really was an ancient alien structure, why would NASA keep it a secret. I mean, NASA is really short on funding, but if it was proven that there was aliens on Mars, then that would mean NASA funding probaly would go through the roof. What better goal could NASA have then to make conatact with extratrestrialls. This must mean that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another mesa. What organization would pass up the opprotunity to get through the roof funding.

So just face the facts. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a mesa that had well placed shadows that are one in a million. So don't be Jeff the astronaut, and just face the facts early on as oposed to having high hopes and dreams just to have them crushed by even more scientifically proven evidence. If you don't remember anything from this article, remember this: don't be Jeff.",5,1,0.8531934022903442

A scientist in NASA had to take caution at the these types of things. I believe that the face is just a natural landform because after all it was just a rock formation, a theory and it takes more than just a weird formation to look into the work of it.

Rock formations happens all the time on different planets. A camera circling the planet Mars could not even recognize the ""Ailens"". It was just a formation because there is no actual proof of ailens being on the planet. Rock formations come in different shapes and sizes.

""Ailens"" being on the planet is very rare and is a theory. There was no actual footage of aliens. Conspiracy theories happen all the time, just because a face appeared on the surface does not mean ailens were there. It could even be something else other ailens on Mars. Theories are not scientifically proven because everyone has their own controversial opinion.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were all excited and quite confused when the JPL appeared on a website. It was just a natural landform. No ailen momument happened at all.Web surfers had pictures of the face and there was no signs of ailens.

The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.There were no actual signs of aliens even with videos and pictures. Conspiricies and Theories happen all the time so everybody will have their own opinion and sometimes it can be controversial. Controversial statements and opinion is what shapes humanity today.

31fffb2,"Have you ever heard about the thing that happened at NASA twenty five whole years ago? Well it was one of the biggest things that was a thing because they were figuring out if it was a real face or not. It was difficult but i'm pretty sure they found out about it even if it wasn't a face but were about to find out.

The face was a really difficult thing to focus on for as long as they did. I don't think they would've focused on it as much as they did if it wasn't so important to figure out honestly. It was just a shadow they saw out of plain sight while a spacecraft was circling around and then they suddenly saw a shady shadow and it looked like a human face. Only a few days later is when they showed the image they took of they shadow for everyone to see. The face begin to be known and everyone was soon to know about it after they reached out and posted the picture of the unknown face.

There was many obstacles to find out who's face it was. ""Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planrt, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,1), This little bit of a paragraph tells us that basically someone was out just snapping pictures and found this. That's overly rare too have something like that happen.

Others might say that think it's all fake but in my prespective I believe that you can't just go and and discover that and it all be fake it's not happening and it never like that. I also believe that it would be hard to take a picture of that thing when you were supposed to do what you were supposed to do. Let people believe that it's ""fake"" but they have prove that's very specific that i cited in paragraph three. This is just beliefs and honesty now others might be different a lot might think different because no minds think the exact same all the time it's simply just what I believe.

All in all my beliefs are still the exact same I'm sticking to what I think is right. Everyone has their own opinion but if it would get bad because people think all differently this is just what I have on mind. The face in my eyes I believe was real because you can't just drop what you're doing and go take a picture of something that's totally fake. Everyone has their own opinion though and that's how I see it.  ",2,1,0.7490693926811218

Some believe that the face was created by aliens, others including NASA, and myself believe that it is just a natural landform. NASA research states in the article that it is just a huge rock formation, and there is common landforms around the American West. Also web surfers get dissapointed when what they been waiting for is really just a land formation.

When NASA unveiled the image for all to see they caption the picture ""huge rock formation."" They also stated ""human face..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" They also state ""huge rock formation that resembles a human head."" This shows that NASA believes and told the public that what some think is created by aliens is really just a natural landform.

Similar pictures have been found common around the American West, that look just like the ""face"" on Mars. The article states that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" Garvin states ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the snake River Plain of Idaho."" This shows that

NASA compares the face to comman landforms already found and explains they are very similar.

Thousand of anxious web surers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, only to reveal a... natural landform. They text states ""there was no alien monument after all."" The text also states that ""web surfers who waited so long for what they thought was going to be great was really just land."" This shows that the web surfers where disapointed in there find, and there hopes not becoming realality.

However, those who say it is created by aliens disaprove with the fact that the ""face"" is just natural landforms. The text states ""but not everyone was satisfied. The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winte in April '98--a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Also the text goes on to state ""some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide."" These examples from the text show and help prove why people belive they were created by aliens and isnt a natural landform.

So as you can see NASA and myslef belive that the face is simply just a natural landform for many reasons proven. NASA states its just a huge rock, web surfers where dissapointed in there findings, and similar landforms have been found that match up to the face. Little do people know, the face is actually just a natural landform and not a alien creation like some hoped to find. Alien creation? Silly nonsence. Natural Landform?

The face on Mars has raised the concern on whether there is life on Mars.\ Most scientists believe that there is not enough evidence to show that there is infact life on Mars. Common people ,who disagree with scientists and other people who agree with the scientists, think there is enough evidence for life to be on mars. Life on Mars has been a very contradictory argument for many years. There has never been 100% true evidence of life on Mars. Many people just want to believe there is life.

First of all, the face on Mars has never shown any pure evidence that there is alien civilization on Mars. No on has ever been on Mars' surface to check around the face to see if there actually is pure evidence to support alien existence. If life does exist on Mars, we probably would have more evidence than we do now.

Next, for many years NASA and many other scientists, or even the common man, have been debating whether there really is life on Mars, or used to be. All of the pictures that scientists have now show no sign of life. If there was life, we probably would have noticed more structures around the face by now.

Finally, The main reason there is a debate between common men on whether there really is life on Mars is that they simply just want to make themselves believe there is life on Mars. The convince themselves there is life. They still have no scientific facts to support their claim.

In conlusion, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. If there is alien life on Mars, then there is no 100% pure evidence that there is or ever was.

NASA thought it had unsual shadows to make it look like a Egyption Pharaoh, a few days later after the discovery Nasa unvieled the image for all to see. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows- even haunted grocery checkout lines for 25 years-some people think the Face is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide.

Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, and so on April 5, 1998, when MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture of the face. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL we site, revealing ...a natural lndform. There was no alien monument after all. Mission controllers prepared to look again.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, MGS drew close enough for a second look and got a much better photo of the Viking photo. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. There are mant reasons why the face could have been made by aliens or if it was made by something else most likely it was aliens in my poinion, but we need proof to be able to determine if it was or not.

The article is just saying that there could be alien life out there, because there is so much that is undiscovered an things we do not know about, so it is possible that it was aliens or if it was something else think about it what do you think about all this?",2,1,0.8667674660682678
32630a9,"The Face from Mars is just a natural landform and not something an alien created because there's is no life in Mars that we know of. NASA also used a camera's absolute maximum resolution to see if it was created by someone or something.

327dc64,"For years, many people have argued with scientists (at NASA) that the Face on Mars is alien made. Conspiracy theorists and most of the general public are set on believing that the Face is an ancient alien artifact. But, NASA has reliable evidence to back up and prove that the Face is just a fascinating natural landform.

First off, you cannot argue with the pictures that were taken of the Face. Even from the first picture ever taken of the landform in 1976, scientists were able to conclude that the Face was just another Martian Mesa, that just resembled a human face, specifically an Egyptian Pharaoh. In this photo, there was no evidence of any alien markings on the structure.

On the other hand, conspiracy theorists and skeptics argue that the picture isn't clear enough for someone to make out any markings on the landform. So, in 1998, another photo was taken of the face. It was ten times sharper than the original Viking photo, and it still revealed only just a natural landform. People still weren't satisfied and pressed on though, arguing that the picture was taken on a cloudy day and the haze in the photo blocked out any special markings or evidence. But then a couple years later in 2001, scientists got another image of the Face on a clear day with the camera's absolute maximum resolution, (and you would be able to see any objects or markings that was there) and there was still no signs of markings indicating alien interaction.

Also, the face is just another Martian Mesa, a natural landform. I will say it is a fascinating landform, but it is still natural. The Face resembles natural landforms found common in the American West, like buttes and mesas. It especially looks similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This proves that yes, it is possible to have natural landforms like the Face, and it is comparable to some of the landforms we have here on Earth.

In conclusion, there is multiple credible sources to back up scientist's (at NASA) claim that the Face is just a natural landform. There are a few different photos of the structure, each photo having higher resolution and being easier to make out than the previous one. With all three photos, there is no evidence of any special markings or objects that would suggest or prove of alien life. Also, there are similar landforms like the Face here on Earth so it's not like it is a freak of nature that nobody could ever see how something so interesting was made; it's comparable to things here even in America.

First of all, the cameras that are used are the best they can possibly make.

They even used the maximum resolution the camera can poduce.

It can even see if there were to be small objects near the Face.

They've used those cameras and they didn't see anything that proved to be life-like.

First you must bring into consideration that to have a logical reason to think that aliens created the face on Mars you would have to have reliable evidence that there is life on Mars. Without the evidence of life on Mars, there would be nothing to base this belief off of, other than hope. Also, there are landforms on Earth that were created naturally that resemble this lanform.

The way the ""face"" looks in the pictures can also be caused by lighting and the way the picture was taken. If pictures were taken today, it could have better resolution and it might not even look like a face.

Scientists have found flowing water on Mars, so the ""face"" could have been created by weathering and erosion and just happened to look like a face. It may have also been created by storms with weathering and eroding.

Garvin mentions that,"" If there were homes in the most recent picture, you would have been able to see them because the quality of the picture has increased to the point where it is almost as clear as you could get.

3417267,"Mistaken Face

NASA is a space program in the U.S. It has been for quite some time now. NASA has sent numerous things into space but one in specific has caused a great deal of curiosity through out the world. In 1976, a NASA spacecraft, Viking 1, took pictures of Mars and something unusual happened. A face apeared in a picture. At first NASA thought of the possibility of it being a foreign life form. But that possibility was stopped when scientists found out that it was just another Martian Mesa. A common landform on Mars. When the pictures were released to the public, many thought that NASA was lying, especially conspiracy theorists. They thought that NASA didn't want the public to know about an alien life form. That was very irrational.

Many people don't like the idea of space exploration because they say it's a waste of money. If NASA encountered foreign life forms, it would only be benefitial to tell the public because then NASA would gain popolarity and skeptism of the program would decrease. Many people would be curios about it and would want to know more about the race. Therefore NASA would have a better reputation and be more popular because of their discovery.

Secondly,technology has changed significantly since 1978. The original picture looks more like the face than any other one because of the old technology. In 1998, the picture looks more detailed. In 2001, it looks even more detailed. In 1976 the camera that took the photo only captured 43 meters per pixel making it much less definated compared to the picture taken in 2001 that captured 1.56 meters per pixel. This technology makes it less of a face.

Finally, because of the newer and more advanced technology, NASA's scientists could look further in to the so called alien face. After studying it, the scientists concluded that the ""face"" was a mesa. A mesa isnt't only found on Mars. It can also be found on Earth. There is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it even has the same height as the Face on Mars. The ""face"" is more of a natural landform than anything.

New technoogy, comparable lndforms, and the explanation of how alien races would benefit NASA helped the space program prove conspiricy theorists and the public wrong. All of these supports are hard evidence that the face was a mesa in disguise. Although the finding of an alien race would be revolutionary, it's safe to say that the ""face"" isn't the discovery of one. We'll just have to wait until the future to encounter a race that isn't our own.  ",4,1,0.7704320549964905

Also if this was true, NASA wouldn't hide this because if they were to discover ancient civilization they would earn alot of money.

To start off there are different looking landforms on are planet why can't there be others. In the first set of pictures it shows the landform changed,so a face wasn't there to begin with,it was forming over time. Also sometimes when the human mind is told something it would try to shape together to form what was said, so this could be just a natural landform and your mind is changing it.

Also NASA would not keep this a secret if alien activity was found in this area,if anything NASA would make alot of money off of this discovery if it did have to do with aliens. But if NASA wanted to keep it a secret they wouldnt have took a picture and let the media get ahold of it they would have kept the pictures stashed away. Also the media is known to blow things out of proportion.

In conclusion of my argument,we have tried and tried for many years to find something unatural or indifferent on another planet,eventually we would have stumbled upon something, but its just a landform,no alien activity. My question is after reading this argument couldn't this massive piece in history just turn out to be a rock?

The news about seeing a face on Mars is a big deal,but some people didnt think it was such a big deal.Many people made comments about the picture and said it was made by aliens, but many other said it was a natural landform.many people have gotten over excited and about the face and people made movies about it and books,it was on magizine covers, it was even on talk shows.But , Scientists like myself think that this face is just an illusion.Many of us think its just another martion mesa, that ae common enough around Cydonia.A few days later we recieved an image for all to see , it noted ''huge rock formation''.so, this face that everyone is so crazy about ,thinking that aliens did it is not true.the face is just a big illusion,formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,a nose and a mouth.the picture first take in 1976 was a not a clear shot of the face, so the next picture taken in 1998 was a better picture that showed the formation clearer.th e picture revealed a natural landformation,so there was no alien monument after all.

341cf30,"I believe that the Face is just a natural landform because they even had pictures that proved that is was a natural landform. Many people in the world had their own personal claims about the Face, but scientifically, it had been proven by pictures otherwise.

Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and captured pictures of the Face with a ten times better camera than the original Viking photos that were taken before. In the article, the text says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Even cameras caught the landform with pictures and proved it. The text also states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" According to this piece of informational text from the article, the Face is a massive, natural landform, just like any landform here on Earth.

In this article, it has been proven by NASA and detailed pictures of the Facee, that it's just a natural landform that just so happened to look like a human face. Even though some had their own thoughts and opinions, scientifically, they were wrong. ",3,1,0.8887981176376343
34229a5,"The Face is just a natural landform because there are plenty of landforms like the Face on Planet Earth, it was common in the Red Planet called Cydonia, and it is only giving illusions of a human face. Some might say the Face is some type of way that aliens are trying to tell us that they're here with us. Others might say the other half is crazy. But who is correct?

Earth has thousands of landforms, but only a few are really special. In Paragraph 12, Garvin states ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars."" I believe what Garvin is trying to say is that the Face really isn't all what it seems to be. Our landforms on Earth might be on Earth for the same reason that they are on Mars. Then, in the first sentence of paragraph 12, the author is saying that the Face is ""equivalent of a buttle or messa--landforms common around the American West."" I think the author is trying to hint to the readers that the Face is, again, almost just like the landforms on Earth. Earth is the only planet that supports life, but isn't the only planet to have natural landforms.

The article also states that these types of things are common around Cydonia. Cydonia is a Red Planet where they set up cameras that helped then find the Face. Cydonia was only showing unusual shadows at the time so scientists just thought of it as another ""Martian mesa"" like the one's on Cydonia. In paragraph 3, they say that NASA unvieled the image with a caption saying ""huge rock formation..."" which could just be an astroid that hit the planet and while it smashed into Mars, it could have chipped. There are always rocks flying in space hitting anything that get's in its way.

The Face is also only giving illusions of a human's face. the Face was giving off shadows which made it look like a face because it formed a pair of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, which is stated in paragraphs 2 and 3. Also, in paragraph 8, it says ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face"" which could be part of the reason of why they are seeing shadows. Illusions are only from what you want to believe something is.

The Face is just a natural landform because there are plenty of landforms like the Face on Planet Earth, it is a common landform in the Red Planet called Cydonia, and it is only giving the illusions of a human face.

It revealed a natural landform which meant there was no alien monument. Some skeptics argued that alien markings were hidden by a haze. In 2001 another photo was taken. Each pixel spanned 1.56 meter compared to 43 meters in the 1976 photo.

The picture shows a butte or mesa which also appear in the american west. In this photo if there were anything abnormal you would be able to see it. Instead it is just a natural landform on Mars.                                                      ",2,1,0.8670849800109863

After we saw the face on Mars we had to get more pictures of it. That might not change your mind, and you still might think it was an act of alien's ,but check this out. In paragraph 3 it says that it was a huge rock formation. It resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This could possibly mean that it's the angle you are looking at it. If you were looking at the ""head"" from a diffrent angle it would probably not even look like a head anymore. This is a reason why it could not have been from aliens.

In paragraph 2 it says that when the face appeared on their monitors they were surprised. Even though the sensation was short lived, scientist figured it was just another martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. You may be asking, ""Why dont you target Cydonia?'. The answer is it's hard work. In fact its very difficult work. The reason we don't target Cydonia is because, ""We don't pass over the face very often,"" says Garvin in paragraph 9.

On April 8, 2001 a nice day in Cydonia We finally got a second look at it. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. They captured another photo finally with one of their best camera's.

Now you are probably asking yourself what does this have to do with aliens. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Meaning that it wasn't an alien act. It was a huge rock formation.",3,1,0.8402761220932007

It was a very clear picture of a face looking back at the camrea. The photo shows a gray piee of land with some bumps that look like they can be facial features.

It became very popular. It was in movies magazines grocrey stores, and even talkshows. It caused a really big scene. People were arguing weather its right or not. Between people deciding weather its real or not. NASA was trying to get more images of it. So they can finally see what it is.

People got alot of ideas on what it might be. An alien, ghost or maybe even another human race. They waited pationtly/ impationly for them do release new pictures for more proof. People were longing for more answers, so Garvin gave it to them.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to get some better pictures. So on a cloudless day, Garvin took a picture, revealing that ot was just a landform and not an actual face.

But he also said it is very hard trying to hard to pass over that face and they dont pass over ot very often.

3496a0a,"False Face on Mars

For some decades people have been spark with the idea of an acient civilization/aliens on Mars for a while due to Viking 1 capturing a picture of what seem to be a face on Mars. Hollywood movies, commercial, comics, and etc commercial things have fill the minds of many people with flase accusation. The saying of don't always beleive what you see or hear is true in this situation. There are many reason why this information is false. And I as a scientist at NASA will give you reason and facts on why it is flase.

The truth is there is no face on Mars. If there were face on Mars there would be many more sign of life and ancient artifact or buildings from ages ago. Just like in Earth there were many sign leading to ancient civilization such as the Inca, Maya, Aztec, and Egytian. This civilization had proof such as ruins, artifact, and fossil leading to it, but there weren't any sign of any of those in Mars instead there was just an asume face . As one can see here with just an asume face on Mars so it was unlikely that an aliens/other being did it.

A person might claim that scientists could be hiding fact from people so they don't find out the truth about the face like an alien actually making the face. I as a scientist would have already known report or leaked if some scientist were hiding something. Scientist love to share facts or truth, it is their second nature. And it is our responsibility to tell you guys about new fascinating discover we made not hide it. And this proof that is it would be pointless for scientist to hide the truths from people.

One of the most vauble reason is that the picture was taken in the 1900s. At the time the camera qualities and technowlogy weren't as advance as nowdays. The article state that there were three perfect shot of the picture taken one from 1976, 1998, and 2001. there is abig difference in each of these shot. In the 1976 picture it show a picture of what seem to be a face but later on in the 1998 picture it show a disoriented face or landform. Then in the last picture in 2001 it show a martian or a natural landform such as one that is in Earth. The qualities in these has much difference as the 2001 one being the most advance. The face also was effect by shadow from Mars, as state in the article that the dark color for the eys and nose plus mouth of the face image was cause by shadow from an angle in Mars due to the camera not being able to take a perfect angle of the martian. And all these fact are poiting out that the face on Mars is a false information.

With information scientist have been gathering and finding an alien being or an acient civilization on Mars is a dead end. The media is have a great effect on the people minds leading them to not see the truth that the face on Mars is a very false idea coming from the people minds, Now that the facts has been out to public people are agreeing with the scientist more and more. Thus all these facts and research from scientists leading to that the Face on Mars is FALSE but just a martian landform.                 ",5,1,0.866027295589447

the "" FACE"" on mars is a formationof rock wether it be by martin creatures or by nature. I am going to beon the side it was a natural formation. i will support my claim with these three reasons; rock formations, life on mars, and publicity.

My first reason is rock formations. For example there is a vast amount of mesas and or buttes on mars and on earth. This example shows that rock formations can appear almost any where. My second supporting idea is that an astroid could have hit in that rock patch like in Arizona . This example shows that astroids could have played a part in the rock's formation. My third reason is that the rock formaion could have been a natural thing like mountains for example. This example shows that nature can do some weird things. In conclusion the ''face'' on mars could actually be a rock formation on the planet.

My second reason is that it is an illution.For example you can change the sun light amount on the ''face'' and it will look nothing like a face. This example shows that the rock formation could be an optical illution. My second statement is that mabye just maybe be an photoshop thing. This example shows that a lot of things may not be what they seem.",2,1,0.76179039478302
34ee3cc,"I believe that the face was land made because in the picture from 1976 in the fifth pharagraph, it looks like a face. But when you look at the other pictures at the top of the article you don't see any dips that point towards alien creation. I belive that like, in the article, it was just an effect of the light and shadows. The shadows could have been made by a higher point of the mesa and when the light hit it just right, it made it look like a face. In the last pharagraph, Jim Garvin, the cheif scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program said, "" It reminds me of Snake River Plain in Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

To me Garvin's idea of what the Face on Mars really is, seem very logical. There have been land formations that people say are made by aliens. But, for all we know it could have been man made millions of years ago. We will never know because we don't have strong enough evidence to prove if it was man made, a creation made by aliens, or was simply made over time. Looking at the third image at the top of the article, you can see that there is nothing on the surface of the Face on Mars. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern thins in a digital image 3 times bigger then the pixle size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shake, you could see what they were."" Garvin said in pharaghraph eleven.

From far away the Face looks like, well, a face. But, once you get a close up of it you can see that it was only a forplay of shadows. The things that we hear about on the news, in magazines, radio talk shows, films, and books get so blown out of praportion that people will read it and believe that there really is a face on mars that was created by aliens. I understand that there are some things that we really don't know about, and maybe never will. But, I believe that if there are aliens, that we would be given some strong evidence that they were on mars, earth or wherever.

But, for now, we will have to keep looking into things and discover more things about earth and the things that happened on earth and to earth millons of years ago. When technoligy advances and we get more chances to look at things and get deeper into research, we will know if there really are aliens or not.",4,1,0.8834548592567444

New technology allowed scientist to get a better look a the ""The Face on Mars"" . With a camra that had high resolution 3D altimetry they finaly discovered what it really was , a mesa .

In the text it says, ""evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This helps explain that it wasn't created by aliens because if it was NASA would hide it for certain reasons and I will give examples. The first example is that if NASA showed people this and they said it was real they would be scared about it. The second example is that if this were real NASA wouldn't let other people or organizations use it for attractions, movies, or for money and for them just to take the credit.

When NASA first saw the ""Face on Mars"" they claimed they spotted what the text states, ""the shadowy likeness of a human face."" The image was found when they were snapping photos of possible landing sights for Viking 2, one of NASA's spacecrafts circling the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The passage later states, ""But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" The scientits even said it was just a landform. They stated that it has,""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The scientists are not saying it's a alien monument either. They are just saying people could petray it that way.

A few days after this discoery NASA unveiled the image. When they unveiled it there was a capiton under it reading, ""huge rock formation."" NASA said the formation resembles a head and was formed by shadows giving the illusion of the facial features. This just made the Face a publicity stunt for most people. This might be when most would believe that it is some sort of a alien monument. But then NASA passed over the Face again and this time took a phots much greater then the last.

On April 5, 1988, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the ""Face on Mars."" They snapped picutres ten times sharper then before. The text states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site."" Thouands waited for the photo and what the photos unveiled were the truth. The photos revelead a natural landform, not any alien monument. Some people still believed that the structure was still an alien monument. But NASA learned that not all will believe.

All this evidence is just showing you that it is a natural landform. They have coordinates of this landform. They have amazing pictures just showing you that this is real. Even scientists examining the photos and showing exactly how what it is. What is it you must ask? It's a landform. NASA knew not all would believe but it made no sense to them. They supply so much evidence but still some just don't believe. The ""Face on Mars"" resembles a human head but shadows give it the illusion of a face.

In conclusion, the 'Face on Mars' is nothing more then a natural landform. We have photo proof of the Face along with scientists examining it and telling all who do not believe what it is.

35b9791,"I do not believe that the masked face was made by aliens. I believe that in a varety of reasons.

First, if aliens built the face then NASA would have found where the living area was and they absoulutely did not see any people on Mars. Unfortunetly they did not find living organims living on Mars. Wind is always blowing on Mars so that doesn't mean that aliens made it.

According to the text is states that there are multiple landforms on Earth just like the one on Mars. They When NASA took a picturee that was three times bigger they saw that there were objects that looked like airplanes on the ground or Egytptian - style pyramids or even small shacks. The article states that landforms ae common around the American West. Garvin states that' It reminds him most of the Middle Butte i the Snake River PLain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that tkaes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Then many peope around the world were waiting to see the Face on Mars on TV, but when they saw the picture nobody believed that the face was created by aliens. As it states in the article "" As a rule of thunb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size."" Sometimes when you take a picture, the picture might add adjustments to the photo to make it look more realistic.

There are many places aroudn the world that has matured over time due to landforms. The Grand Canyon, Rivers, Volcanoes, and high pieces of land that look like animals are all examples of things that cahnge over time due to the changing of the Earth. People aren't the only things that make mountains, rivers, and canals most features of the world come from landforms that change over long periods of time.

In the article the Face on Mars changes in a couple of weeks adn that is due to the changing of Mars. The turning of the planets is also another reason of how landforns change. When it is cold, the freezing tmperatures can cause things to ctack adn split open. During the hot weather, the hot temperatures can change things by heating up the land land until it eventually starts to sink. Whe there was a lot of cloud cover on Mars the first time they took pictures it was really difficult to seek out.

I do not believe that aliens had biult the Face on Mars. Eventually they will find the truth and when that day comes then there could be more information and new discoveries. Until then there are more things to learn about Mars.    ",3,1,0.8496919870376587

This quote from the text means that the picture was not of a face, but of a landform common around American West. A second reason the face on Mars is just a landform is the picture tooken in 1976 was very clear

than the photo tooken in 2001.In the text it states, "" Each pixel in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo.

One last reason the face on Mars is just a landform is, In the passage it states, "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" This means that the photo they took after the 2001 picture was clear and people could see what the face of Mars really was.

Which is not really possible for the people to believe that Aliens had created this because of all the pictures that where taken there was no picture with a alien life form. Another reason for this is that you can see things in the digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. That way if there were other objects on Mars than you would be able to see that they were.

The conspiracy theorists thought that it could have been made by aliens.

One way we know that they ""face"" was natural and not made by aliens was we have landforms like that on Earth. They said ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

What Garvin really said was ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This also proves that it was not made by aliens, because the picture they took is very precise.

Some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on Mars. While scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom. Today I am only going to explain a few.

The first reason why this ""face"" should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. the facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth are an optical illusion. The reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one.

Another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because, these type of landforms are common in the US. An example of these types of landforms is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.

However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life. The reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments. But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph.

So in conclusion the ""face"" on Mars was a natural landform. It is classified a landform because it is a rock formation. Also, because these types of landforms are common in the US. It should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion.             ",3,1,0.8556844592094421

36eaa58,"Switching Sides

Have you ever heard of the man on the moon? Well Mars has a similar thing. They both ,at the time, had formations that looked like human faces. Some think it was made by aliens or some other superior being. However, the reality of it is that its just a natural formation that looks like a face. That part can be nocked out when you zoom up on it. The lines and basic formation of the mesa,the face, are too natural to be made by an intelligent species. Finally, if there was some marks or sign that it was created by aliens it would have shown up on the image due to the high resolution. We are looking farther then we should with this natural formation.

At the moment the most recent picture from 2001 completly exterminates any facial recognition. You can see natural lines that run across the mesa and the higher elevation of certian areas. The eyes are just a steep hill that geos to the top. While the mouth seemingly isn't even there anymore. You can see the worn away parts indicating that its been there for quite awhile. The shadows aren't even there at the time which creates the distictive features. It bearly even looks like a face anymore.

I was talking about the NATURAL lines that appear on the mesa. The lines on the mesa are to distictive to be created. If something made it they would have wanted smooth edges as well as an even ditch. If they tried to recreate the natural look it would have looked faulty and unbeliveable. The species would have completly deformed the hill exposing its true colors. Also what reason would they have for creating a random face with the possibility of no one ever seeing it. There is no point to it.

Finally, the final reason for it not being alien-made is if there was marking on the mesa giving reason to believe it was created be aliens they would have been shown. If any wierd symbols showed up on the screen we would have seen it and still release the image. Why would we hide this from the world if it would increase the amount of funding we get from companies. You can study the image for hours, but not find a single symbol anywere on the image. The camera would have picked it up and we would have studied it.

The mesa was not created by aliens if only looks that way to us because are minds are hardwired to find faces. Its much easier to remember a face rather than a name. Everything about the image is natural it wasn't put there for some unnoticable reason that we can't comprehend. It just existis thats all... nothing more nothing less. No aliens had anything to do with this mesa. ",4,1,0.8034987449645996

First of all, the Face does not signify a statue or proof of alien existance. In paragraph 7, the text clearly states, "" There was no alien monument after all.""

This means that aliens could not have created the Face as a signification or monument to proof thier existance.

Second, the Face is a landform. The Face looks more a landform that could have caused by the harsh weather on Mars. In paragraph 12, the text clearly states,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms that are common around the American West."" The author also states in the text,"" It reminds me mostly of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" This means that the Face was a landforms caused by its location on Mars.

CA: Aliens could have made the Face as a siblimal message. They could not have because there is not any evidence that aliens did it. The Face is in the north part of Mars and that is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa.

In conclusion, aliens did not cause the Face on Mars because it is a land form caused by the weather on Mars. If aliens caused the Face on Mars it could have a been more evidence of their existance, and the Face would not look more of a landform.

One thing we discovered in our research was throughout the years that we have taken these photographs that the ""face"" has started to just look like a big rock. It was due to the shading that the ""face"" looked like it had eyes and a nose.

We also discovered that the rock formation is much like some of the formations here on Earth. All of the Earth formations were caused naturally and not by aliens. The fact that it was a cloudy season when the last picture was taken is true. Although in the picture we can see that it was clear.

In conclusion with all of the facts we have found this is indeed not a face created by aliens. There is enough evidence to tell us this. If it was an alien structure then we would benefit from it.

371c937,"In May, 1976, Mars became the center for many conspiracy theories and research for alien life. A picture of what seems to be a huge head in a rock formation was unveiled, and immediately started to sway people's minds that there might be alien life on Mars. Some took this belief way too far. However many conspiracy theories are claiming that the martian mesa in Cydonia is a sign of alien life, none of them are correct. In all truth, it is just another naural land formation on the desolate planet.

When a picture of the mesa was first unveiled to the public, it made so many people believe it was a sign of life on Mars. NASA claimed that is was just a normal rock formation, and was confirmed in 2001 when they took another picture with newer technology, revealing a big mesa with a few craters. People still don't believe NASA that it is just a crater. If the mesa was a sign of alien life, NASA would benefit greatly from it. So when people say that it's a sign of life and NASA knows about it, that's so incredibly wrong because if it was, NASA would be there right now with a rover, exploring the strange sign. NASA has done extensive research on this, and have found no life, while people are claiming huge things like this without doing any research, so it is very hard for anyone to believe them.

The next photo, taken in 1998, of the mesa reveals nothing but a natural landform. When the picture was taken, there were some wispy clouds over the top of it, which made some people believe alien markings were hidden by haze. Even though there is a slight haze over the mesa, there is no way a slight haze could hide alien markings the way some people belive. Even with the haze, the picture is still much more clear than the original photo from 1976.

The newest, and most clear picture is from 2001. It was a cloudless day this time when the Mars Global Surveyor passed over the mesa and snapped a picture of it. The picure was taken using the highest resolution in the camera's capability. This type of quality photography allowed for us, back on Earth, to be able to see if there were even smaller objects on the mesa, like airplanes or small shacks The picture revealed, once again, that there is not really a face on the mesa on Mars. The conspiracy theorists are still coming up with ways to try and find a way to make NASA seem like liars. After 25 years, it still didn't work.

After 25 years, and 3 picture all concluding that the mesa has no sings of life, people are still talking about crazy ideas of life outside of Earth. While there is a possibility of life outside of Earth, there is definitely none currently on the mesa that has created so much controversy, for such a long period of time all around the world.

I am a scientist at NASA and I was one of the people who discovered this land form.

Many people think it is a natrural land form, while others think it was created by aliens.

Mars has lots of crators on the surface and it is just that.

A crator.

There is no way aliens could have made this land form.

It is over two miles long. For them to make this it would have taken many of hundreds of years.

I personal think that if there are any aliens they would not be an advanced civilization to create something like this.

Another reason why they could have never made this is how would the aliens know what a human face looks like.

This land form is just like they face on the moon, no one made it.

It just showed up after years and years of being hit by meterors and the push and pull of gravity.

There is no evidence that they live on mars, let alone any other planet.

If they do exist I would have no problem with that, but as of right not there is no evidence that they do.

I believe that Mars was created as natural landform just like Earth. It has simular landforms as Earth. Mars has a dry sandy desert like climate simular to Earth. Except Earth has alot of different types of climates. If Aliens has made Mars why did they make it simular to Earth's desert climate? If aliens did make the climate for Mars it propbably would have been way different than a desert climate. Earth was made naturally and has naturally made several climates. The desert climate is one. Aliens could not have possibly made Mars because if they did where did they go? Why did they leave? They probably would have stayed and lived on Mars if they had created it.

Mar's desert climate has very simular landforms as Earth's desert climate. Garvin from the passage Unmasking the face on Mars has said ''It reminds me most of middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho''. That was from the 12th paragraph.

That's another example the Mar's climate has simular landforms as Earth's desert climate. Scientist have said that Earth was like venus at first and then came together and formed on what it is like now naturally.

Aliens could have not possibly built Mars. Mars was probably created simular to how Earth was created. Scientists have even said that along time ago on Mars there use to be water there because they have found spots on mars simular to Earth that rivers run are running on. Now it looks dried up and something has happen to Mars to where it turned Dry and desert like. Earth was the same way along time ago before humans existed. It was a hot fire lava vocanic type of climate until Earth has changed and made several climates and water.

I think the ¨Unmasking The Face on Mars.¨is just the Face of a natural landord.A lot of people might not think it is just a natural landform because on the picture they take on 1976 and 1998 it just excatly look like something else.Here is the reason if you still think it is a something else not a natural landforms ¨New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA´s

Mars Global Survey spacecraft eveal the Face on Mars for what it really is:A mese´´.

One reason is that few the scientist believe that the Face on Mars was an aliens artifact photogarphing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyors arrive at the Red Olanet in Sept 1997.Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeard on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.There was no alien monument after all.People might still thinks it is an a something else but it was not true.

Other reason is that when they take a pictures of Face clearly scientist and NASA can see what it really was after all.¨As a rule of thumb, you can discern thing in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel sizw,¨he added.¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the grounds or Egyprian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you can see what they were!¨But not everyone was satisfied.The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 98- a cloudy time of years on the Red Plante.The camera on boad MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics,alien markings were hidden by haze.

Final reason is that i really is a natural landforms.What the pictures actually

shows is the Martian equivalent of a bute or mesa-landforms common around the American West.¨It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,¨say Garvin.¨That´s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.¨

Introduction is that I still believes that the face is just a natural landform because if you read closely on the article you could see what it really is.If you wants to watch closely on the picture you could see just more than a natural landform.

37b999d,"The ¨Face"" on Mars is a mere coincidence. There are many formations like this one on earth. When using the Mars Global Survey spacecraft it´s high resolution camera picked up no signs of any type of advanced civilization. Authors of magazines at the time also hyped the ¨Face¨ up, to get more people interested in Mars. This story has been used in an array of entertainment, from movies to magazines.

On Earth there are formations called buttes, ¨ That´s a lava domes that take formation of an isolated mesa...¨ according to paragraph twelve. Also in paragraph twelve it states that on Earth these landforms are most common in the American west. These particular formations are especially common in the Cydonia region of Mars. Finding these landforms in this region are so common that the scientists at NASA were shocked at how much it resembled a face, knowing it was not an alien artifact. Another reason that we know it is a butte is because it was not only photographed once or twice but three times!

This landform has been photographed by two different spacecraft, the Viking 1 and the Mars Global Surveyor. These spacecraft were spread apart for a span of over 25 years! The Viking 1 picked up the best images it could for it´s time but the much more recent Mars Global Surveyor has a much better and more accurate image of the ¨Face¨ than the 1976 photo. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) also took two clear photographs of the landform while the 1976 image is blurry to say the least. In 1976 the image was so fuzzy that no one could tell what was there, which led to reporters and authors to excite the public more than what was necessary.

In 1976 authors and reports hyped up the find of this ¨Face¨ on Mars. Authors did this to draw more attention to Mars, which because NASA serves the interests of the people and the government was an outstanding thing but it went to far. After all a face on a planet not all that far from us makes a great headline. Not everyone exaggerated it though NASA, as said in the article, upon releasing the pictures to the public stated ¨huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.¨ The face on Mars was also used in afilm and in countless magazines across the country.

The ¨Face"" on Mars is merely just shadows playing tricks on the eye. The Face is merely a landform with shadows in all the right spots playing an illusion on those who see it. Over the years many claims, false or true, have been made about the Face on Mars and they aren going to stop anytime soon. So far no evidence supports the claims of conspiracy theorists, however that doen´t mean they never will. The ¨Face¨ on Mars has had many stories told about for over two and a half decades, and they are not going to stop anytime soon, but it is important to know that science has not proven anything about the ¨Face¨ on Mars, yet.

The person said, ""since it's alien made you guys are try to hide it from the public."" I told the person, ""that we gave the same photos that we took to the public. So, what we saw everyone have seen it and that is not alien made."" But the person had also added, ""I think the picture in 1998 was planned to be taken in the winter."" But of course that was not true at all, but the person keept saying over and over again.

""That was never planned but that is a mistake that we made"" I said.The person said, ""If you guys made such a simple mistake like this on the how can you say the Face is not alien made."" I told the that it's not easy to take photo of just one spot on Mars with the Viking 1."" I Also said, ""yes we did not have to share the photo but we did. The reason why is so we could get people eye's on Mars. But we had never kownen that it would turn out to be like this. So, I am ready to get all of this over with. Do you have anything else to say.""

The person said, ""it's not only me saying this stuff you know!"" ""Yes I do know that but just because others say somrthing does not mean that it is true. They do not have scientific facts that it is alien made. But what we do have is the facts that it is a landfrom."" The person started to think this all over. But the person started to talk "" okay we do not have any facts about it. But you guys do although I do not want to trust you guys. Anyways what I am trying to say is now I think it is a landform.""

Spotted by the

Viking 1, the impiticular face does in fact closley simular to a face. the possibility of there being aleins is very unrealistic. the face could have just been another butte or mesa. The face could have just been a coincidence. But how could we know? We really can't. we, NASA, could just be saying this to get attention, but mabey not. Even if there was alein landform on mars, we will not be able to know for sure. Like any history, we only know through drawings or writing,and the only evidence we have is this face. Hopfully there will be more to find in near future. Or mabey evcen drawings will appear that we can interpit. If not, then all of NASA still has evidence that there could be .

In conclusion, Mars will probably not hold anything else like this. The picture may look like a face, but its more like mesa or butte. or will there be mystirious things like this again? Proving that it was not a coincedence. Mabey NASA will find other things on different planets, or mabey not   ",2,1,0.8368398547172546
3837aeb,"This face is obviously a natural landform, I mean the sculpting & curves in the picture couldn't have been really focused on so a human/alien must not had have done it. There are also lots of different holes around the landform which means more have must have been formed close by the landform. Also im sure if there was someone or something on Mars when this happened NASA would have saw. The NASA also had said that ""There was no alien monument after all."" Which means that there must not had have been aliens on Mars after all. So the landform had to just be a natural landform. I honestly don't even think that aliens are even smart enough to know excatly how to prcocess this landform. The landform doesn't look done with any kind of tool or anything so therefore I think that yes the sculpture is a natural landform even though that's kind of weird & the article actually shows that as the years go by the landform starts to form even more. It also must have just formed because the article said that the NASA circled it so many times & this is the first time its actually found something.",2,1,0.825669527053833
3889cc7,"Hello, I am a scientist from NASA I am here to tell you that the Face, found on Mars, was not created by aliens, the face is just a natural landform. We have new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from the NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is. The Face is just a mesa created by natural landforms. I am sorry to tell you but aliens do not exist, we haven't found any evidence proving that aliens exist.

Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet Mars taking some pictures of the possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking. While it was taking the pictures for the possible landing sites, something funny had happened, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face on the plant. It turned out to be an enormous head nearly two miles form end to end. No this was not created by aliens. Us scientist have been working as hard as we can to see how this ""Face"" was created. We haven't found anything about it being created by aliens. The Face is just a natural landform. Us scientist at NASA figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, this mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

A few days later us at NASA released the image to the public to see. The title of the image was ""huge rock formation ... which resembles a human head ... formed by shadows giving an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" A few of us scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact, but it was talked about with the scientist of NASA and we decided that it wasn't created by aliens because there is no sign of life on Mars that we have found. On April 5, 1998, is when a Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera, also known as (MOC), team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The pictures revealed that it was a natural landform. There was no proof that it was created by aliens. Aliens do not exist they are just made up and scientists, like me, at NASA have never found evidence about aliens existing.

Not everyone was satified with the picture. Everyone thought that the weather conditions were different because the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. Since it was winter in April '98, it was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board, MGS, had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face, so people thought that the photo that was taken was not a fair photo. The people wanted a fair photo that they could see in almost the same weather condtions. We gave people what they want and we went to look for it again. Mission controllers prepared to look again but it was not easy. The face is very hard to track and get a picture of. The Mars Global Surveyor on Apil 8, 2001, went to take another picture, and it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. The spacecraft had to be 25 degrees to center the Face. Each pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel, but when it was compared to he 2001 image it spans 1.56 meters. The picture was easier to look at and they got a closer view. They came to the conclusion of it just being a natural landform.

In conclusion, the image from NASA, known as the Face, was not created by aliens. The image is just a natural landform. According to scientist, like me, at NASA there was no proof that the Face was not created by aliens. Thanks to the technology that we have it is very clear that the image is just a natural landform that created itself. ",4,1,0.9090993404388428
38a36e7,"I know that people are saying that this is proof that aliens inhabit Mars, but trust me, this is not proof. I wish this was proof. It's exactly what we need to hear right now. It's exactly what we've been needing to hear for years. We wan't to find evidence of life on Mars, so why would be hide any signs from you?

If you still don't belive me, look closer at it. Some images the face is more clear than others. That means that the eyes and nose that you see are just shadows. Aliens wouldn't make an artifact that only looks like a face from certain angles. They would want it to stand out.

Some of you say that the alien markings are hidden behind the wispy clouds. Well, we checked again at a time when it was clear and you could see everything fine. There were no alien markings. Like I said, if there were we would have been extatic. The whole world would have known about it within a few days.

I know it has become a huge pop icon, and I'm sorry yo ruin this for you, but it has to be done. It's just a landform. It's very common around the American West. It resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. If you still want to think that it's a face created by aliens then be my guest. Nobody can stop you.

For those of you who now believe that it's a natural land mark, Nasa is just as disapointed as you. We wanted it to be created by aliens too. It would be pretty nice to finally have actual proof in the existence in aliens. Hopefully our trip to Mars will help us find proof in their existence.            ",3,1,0.7852445840835571
38b22fd,"After the unmasking of thepictures of the face on Mars many people had their own opinions on what created the face and why it was there. Personally I believe the face was not created by aliens and that there was not an ancient civilization on Mars. In the prompt they explained there were shadows that made the mesa in the ground look like it has a nose,eyes, and a mouth.

but there is more evidence like on april 5,1998 the mars global surveyor caught a picure of the ""face"" that was ten times sharper than the picture in 1976 which had no alien monument in the picture. Then on april 8, 2001 which was a cloudless day on Mars the global surveyor caught a photo using the cameras maximum resolution.

38e935c,"Lets begin with so far there is no such thing as aliens or any extra terestrial life for that matter. Also ""The Face on Mars"" is just a natural land form.

As stated in the article "" The Face on mars "" was first discovered in 1976 in thr Cydonia region of the planet. It was discovered while the Viking 1 spacecraft was going around the planet taking pictures. Trying to find a landing space for it's sister ship Viking 2. Although releasing the photo to the public brought attetion to mars it also lead people to belive that there could be life or was life on mars.

Although few scientist believed that "" The Face on Mars"" could be a alien artifact 18 years later they returned to the red planet because "" Jim garvin explaind that thwy felt it was important to taxpayers."" Finally on April 5, 1998 The ""MGS"" flew over Cydonia for the firt time. Michael Manlin and his camera crue took a picture ""ten times better"" than the photo that was taken by the Viking. A lot of people were curious and nervous waiting on the release of the photo. Some were disappointed when it was released because ""it revealed a natural landform.""

They were disappointed because ""The Face on mars is located at "" 41 degrees north martian latitude."" They werent satisfied with thiss because at this latitude it was winter in april of 1998. Which is a cloudy time of year for mars. People were claimimg that perhaps because the camera had to oeer through thr clouds the alien markings were hidden by the haze.

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program said that ""its not easy to target Cydonia infact its hard work."" Then on April 8, 2001. The ""MGS""

was passing over Cydonia and drew close enogh for a picture and they took the picture from the direct center of the face. Also the picture that was taken was better quality than the two before it and was taken on a ""cloudless summer day.""

In conclusion if ""The Face on Mars"" would have been an acient alien arifact you would have been able to tell. So it is just a natural land form. Although it is similar to the lava dome is in the snake river plain of Idaho.                              ",4,1,0.8654007911682129
3906f96,"In 1976, a natural landform that looks like a human face was photographed. IN 1998 and 2001, NASA took more pictures in higher quality. Some people believe that it is an alien artifact or a formation from an old civilization. For many reasons, it is not. One: From our knowledge, mars is unable to support life. Two: Aliens are scientifically unreasonable and myth. Three: It is just an abnormally shaped rock formation that plays with the light to create the illusion of a face. Huge accusations have to have huge evidence, and there is none.

Mars is not able to support life. There is minimal air, no water, no known food source, and it is dangerous with its extreme temperatures. If there was a civilization, when did they get there? How did they get there? Where are they now? If someone was there, then why don't we have any proof or even slight clues? There is no proof or evidence to support people living there. If they lived there, why did they create a huge '""face?"" None of this adds up. Concluding that it was not man-made.

Aliens are not real. There is no solid evidence that aliens exist. UFO's, E.T., or any other alien concepts are irrational. If aliens are seen as supperior or more intelligent and thought of to know of and be capable of better, more complicated technology, then they may have been able to live on mars, but why? Why did they leave? And why did we not find any evidence of inhabitants. Aliens are irrational and have no proof of ever existing, they are as made up as magic.

All this is, is a well positioned rock that plays with your eyes and mind, so you think it looks like something it's not. Because of mars' unique atmosphere, weather, and terrain, the enevibility of the rock just being a rock are very high. There are craters on the moon, and we don't think they're aliens. They are simply part of the moon. Wind, erosion, weather, and heat are all familiar terms. Yet, when they exlplain something, we jump right to the confusing concepts that have no proof, no explaination, and no possible positive outcome.

Today's society loves over-exagerating the importance of some things. This causes us to overthink and make irration conclusions that bear no resemblance to the problem. The ""Face on Mars"" is cold hard rock that was sloppily carved by nature, not humans. If NASA thought anymore of it, we'd be out there right now looking for the aliens, but we are not. This is, because it is an abnormally shaped rock.",4,1,0.8842709064483643
3911f96,"Have you ever seen or ever been on Mars? Most of you might have not, but studying Mars is a part of my job. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.

My first reason is because aliens do not exist. There has been much research in this world to prove that aliens do not exist, but still some people believe that there are aliens. Whenever something weird happens in space, we always have to say aliens exist, and there is a lot of proof that they don't. On Mars, landforms can change, just like any other planet. For example, in 1976 it started out by looking like a bump. Then in 2001, it warped into many different shapes with cracks or ridges in it, and in the end it turned out looking like a face.

My second reason is because NASA has proved that it is a natural landform. It says in paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they recieved the photo it revealed a natural landform. The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. So, the Face was proved to be a natural landform in the end.

My third reason is because the Face looks like landforms on Earth. In paragraph 12 it states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the Americian West."" This tells us that the Face is common and not a shockingly new landform. Also, in paragraph 12 it says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, the Face is obviously not a new thing, because Earth has a landform very similar to it. Landforms are made naturally and it takes many years to start noticing the changes in a landform.

Some people might say that aliens are real and that over the years they have been working on this landform. They could also say that NASA rarely goes over the Face because it is so hard to find, so NASA never sees the aliens because of this reason. This is all true, except that aliens are real; there is no true proof of knowing if aliens are real or not, but they most likely aren't. Also, NASA has proved that the Face isn't a new landform, but that it is similar to many landforms on Earth.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.      ",4,1,0.8618175983428955
394b71b,"Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.

Strangley, the author of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars""

suggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was ""a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,"" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.

Ultimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?

All in all, there is no ""true"" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature. There is no recorded history of the face moving. Also, what ""face"" is the size of man made Mt. Rushmore? In the text, the author states, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" The author is trying to explain that technology has grown with the landmark, and a sharper picture actually reveals an alike picture of the landform that had no sign of any life. The author explained in the text that the high resultion camera was so strong that pyramids, airplanes on the ground, or even the small shacks that you see when you drive down the interstate were crystal clear. This means that the Face had to have been landforms that one person might have mistaken for life on another planet.

On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet, but there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was. For instance, in the text the author stated, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West,"" and, "" Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" With all this said, the Face could have a slight chance of being real life; however, it is highly unlikely that it is true life on another planet.

Ultimately, the Face shown on Mars is just a nautral landform. The Face cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence. All in all, life is changing all around us. New technoloy is being formed, but with a new generation who is ready to show the world what really is in the solar system. The future is in your hands.

394ce95,"The ''face'' is just a natural landform, formed by dirt or sand in the ground.

If it was to be created by aliens, there would have been signs of alien life by now, but there isn't. To top off the reason that the ''face'' is a natural landform formed by dirt or sand or some unknown substance, there is also other weird-shaped looking objects in the ground next to the ''face''. No alien life has been found yet, so with that being said, there shouldn't even be a possibility that aliens created it.

If aliens created the ''face'', there should be footprints or handprints near the ''face'' leading to a possible location showing what may have made it. The ''face'' looks like something buried inside the ground to me, more than something inprinted in the ground. The ''face'' may have just been an illusion.

In my opinion, I think the ''face'' may have been created by wind or the movement of the camera causing wind to blow and create this false-claimed ''face''. The ''face'' has later been viewed in new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft has revealed that the ''face'' on Mars is a mesa. ",2,1,0.8015516400337219

NASA says otherwise that it's just natural landform. The most logical reason is the natural landform, because we haven't had any evidence of aliens being real. Therefore I argue that its just a natural landform and not in any form made by an alien.

First of all, we have no proof of aliens whatsoever. No one has proved that they exist, or that they are real. So why do they think its aliens, when it could've just been a natural landform. Things like these happen all the time, our Earth just happens to make things like these. People are actually beliveing that aliens are real, when really they don't have proof.

Second of all, how would the aliens know how to create it. If to say if they even are real. How would they create it, there aren't any tools on Mars. They wouldn't know what they were making, they would have no idea. The face just happened to be a natural landform, it was not created by aliens. Along with they have no proof ""aliens"" did this.

Third of all, why would they even do this. If they did happen to do it , they didn't even mean too. Because they haven't seen a face so they wouldn't know how to make it. Aliens are not real, if they were it'd be everywhere all over the news. People would be so excited and although going to space is a risk many people would do it. Just to go see the ""aliens"", but no one has proved they are real. Therefore, NASA will stand correctly. The face is just a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA is correct. There is no proof of aliens, and even if there was the slightest chance to having proof. Aliens wouldn't even have meant to do it. They have never seen a face, so why would they just do this. Natural landforms happen all the time. But this one just happened to be spotted by NASA. NASA always seems to be correct on their stats because they do so much research, unlike the other who just suggest that its an alien.

I beleive that the face is formed by natrual landform because in the text it said it was formed by shadows. These shadows formed the mouth, nose, and eyes to make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh as the text states. Also the text states

Then the most unsual thing happened, the spacecraft spotted a ""shadowy likeness of a human face."" NASA is trying to prove that the Face is nothing but a natural landform. Since not everyone was satisfied, NASA continued to explain that the Face has nothing to do with Alien Monument.

NASA's discovery is leading to an argument over whether it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform. The text states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien amrkings were hidden by haze."" This evidence shows how people continue to believe that the Face could've have alien marking all around it, but they couldn't have been spotted because it was winter on the Red Planet so it was very cloudy to spot anything like that. Then on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. The text states ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This proves that if there were any Egyptian like pyramids or any alien type monument, you would be able to see it.    ",2,1,0.8695213198661804

Lastly, their camera would have caught any glimpse of alien markings. These statements are valid because looking at the evidence provided it gives you more facts that any skeptic could.

The passage states that the Face is just the shadow of where the camera was, then creating the affect of the eyes, nose, and mouth that you see in the pictures. It is more than likely just a groovy landform created on the surface of Mars.

It also states that in the Middle of Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho there is a lava dome, and it is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Which is meaning that if there is a landform on the Earth that resembles the Face, then the Face is a natural landform.

Skeptics state that when the scientists tried to get another picture it was very foggy, and that the ""ailien markings"" were hidden by a haze of fog. That is not true because in paragraph 11 they state that they can make a pixel 3 times its size. Hence that if there were alien markings it would have been caught by the camera.

The Face is not an alien marking because it resembles an Earth landform, the face created is just a shadow, and the camera would have caught any alien markings. ",3,1,0.8499846458435059
39b6d1e,"Scientists found ""The Face"" when the NASA's spacecraft Viking 1 was taking pictures to find a landing spot for Viking 2. When the picture was first taken it resembled a human face. Scientists belived it was just another martian mesa because they were commin in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Scientist realsed the picture to the public trying to bring attetion to Mars. They didnt realize how much attention it was going to bring. I'm going to prove it is a natrual landfrom.

The cameras scientists used when the first image of the mesa was taken wasn't the best. In 1998 when NASA's Mars Global Surveyor took picutres of the face you can clearly see that it is a landform. The picture was ten times sharper than the one taken by Viking1. People were still skeptic because there were clouds the camera had to shoot through. They said the alien marking were his by the clouds.

On April 9. 2001 MGS got close enough to take more pictures. They took the pictures and used the absolute resolution to see any ""alien markings"" the picture shows a mesa.

A mesa is like a butte that are common in West America. There are landforms on earth just like the ""alien face"" that some people thought proved there was life on Mars. If there was life on Mars I belive NASA would know about it first. The face got a lot of media attention but in the end it is just another mar discovery in the line of many.

But contrary to what NASA believes there are were other people who said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze.

NASA thinks that it would have been important to tell tax-payers if it were to have been a true alien land mark, but since you did not recieve any information; you can assume it was just a natural landform. If there were to have been a sign of life on that planet (Mars) it would benefit NASA and the whole world would probably know. ""The face"" is located on the part if Mars called ""Cydonia"" which according to Jim Garvin ""Is not easy to target (paragraph 9).""

Mission controllers are preparing to go back and look again so they can try to prove that NASA is not trying to hide any evidence. It will not be easy. Mostly because we don't pass over the face very often. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

In conclusion, NASA is very sure that ""The Face on Mars"" is just an illusion and not bona fide evidence of life on Mars. In the future we hope to discover that it really is just a natural landform and not bona fide evidence on Mars. And if it is evidence maybe we can try to find an acient alien civilation.",3,1,0.8586890697479248
39dca7f,"When the face on Mars was first descovred from a region of the planet called Cydonia first found in 1976, many people thought it might have been created by aliens. However this is not true, the face on this planet is a natural landform. The face is a natural landform because it is equivalent to a Martian mesa, there were no ther objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.

The face on Mars is a mesa. A Martian mesa is commen around the area of Cydonia. The mesa is only seen as a face because it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The shadows give the rock formation the ilolusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa which are landforms common around the American West.

There were no other objects seen in any of the pictures that had been taken. Michael Malin's team captured an extraordinary picture using the camers's maximum resolution. ""As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" Garvin explaned. So if there were any objects in this picture such as airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even a small shack it would have been seen in the pictures.

There was no alien movement detected on Mars. If it was aliens that created this face the camers's would have picked up the movement and captured pictures. On April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed a natural landform proving there was no alien movement.

The Face is a natural landform that was not created by aliens because it is equivelant to a Martiam mesa, there were no other objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.",4,1,0.897444486618042
39f503f,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. It is simply a natural land form. You can find similar land forms on Earth. Also, why would NASA even want to hide the existence of aliens? It is simply illogical to think that it was made by aliens.

The Face on Mars may look like a mask or a face, but that doesn't prove that it was made by aliens. There are many landforms here on Earth that look like faces or animals. NASA has taken photos of it, and it is clearly just a mesa. Why would NASA hide the existence of aliens from us anyways? Considering that it ""has become a pop icon"" and ""has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years,"" wouldn't NASA benifit from the existence of aliens?

NASA has not covered up the existence of aliens. The Face on Mars is just a naturally occuring landform that happens to look like a face. It's fun to think about what would happen if it was an actual face or created by aliens, but it was not made by aliens.

39f7e07,"A spacecraft was launched into outter space. Outerspace consists of many planets, including Mars. On the planet Mars, scientists have a discovered a face. The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

People say the Face was crafted by aliens. Because it was winter, the camera in the spacecraft had to look through clouds to see the Face. Due to the weather conditions, some people say that ""alien markings"" were hidden by fog.

Many details support that the Face on Mars is a natural landoform. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, states that if ""alien markings"" existed on Mars, they would have been discovered because the image of the Face was enlarged 3 times the pixel size. Also, the Face resembles a butte or mesa, common landforms around American West. In fact, Garvin also says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This is an ""isolated mesa"" that is almost the same height as the Face.

Proven with facts, the Face on Mars is just a natural landorm. Outerspace has many wonderful discoveries. With proper research and equipment,

39f9997,"The Face on Mars is a natural landform and not something that was created by aliens. The Face is a natural landform because the sharper pictures that were taken after the Viking photos revealed that it was a natural landform. Secondly, the scientists had taken another photograph which helped confirm what exactly the Face was. Also, the text states that the Face is ""equivalent of a butte or mesa."" Although some people think that the Face was created by aliens, there isn't enough information to support that claim.

First of all, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia in 1998. According to the passage, they ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" This means that this camera probably caught eye of more objects and got a more detailed idea of what this formation looks like. The Viking photos weren't as detailed, so the people who saw those photos originally got the idea that aliens had created it. The picture that was captured had revealed that this was, in fact, a natural landform.

Secondly, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to Cydonia on a cloudless day, since some people were second-guessing if the picture was accurate or not. According to the text, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,"" meaning that they could retrieve even more detailed objects. For example, the story says that if there were objects like shacks or airplanes, then they could see what they were. Also, the text states that ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" People could trust these pictures and what scientists say that it is a natural landform because these photographs were very detailed.

Lastly, the very detailed photograph that was taken showed that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa. Butte and mesas are landforms that are commonly found around the American West. According to the passage, Garvin compared the Face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He had said ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Also, the scientists had already figured that this Face was another Martian mesa because they were commonly found around the area of Cydonia. This information is showing that the Face is most likely a landform.

The Face on Mars is a landform because of the factual evidence that was found. The cameras that were used were high quality, providing photographs that were very precise and accurate. Also, the photographs had showed that the Face was similar to formations on Earth. Therefore, all of this information concludes that the Face on Mars is indeed a landform and was not formed by aliens. ",4,1,0.8791643381118774

Yes I can see what perspective they're comming from because the ""Face on Mars"" was up in space and space isnt just like a place here or there its our galaxy. Who knows what's going on up there everyday? Many people, even scientists believe that the ""Face of Mars"" was indeed infact created by aliens.

Then there was this article about the ""Face on Mars"" it was called, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". It stated that many people had the thought that aliens did in fact create the ""Face of Mars"" and NASA even had scientists go on a mission to unravel the truth about the ""Face on Mars"" with evidence. It stated exactly from the article, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Yes that is great that they were concluding the fact that maybe perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze but they're not sure it was just an assumption. But around April 5,1998 it stated from the article that, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" That is evidence that the ""Face on Mars"" was in fact a landform.

In conclution many people still think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens. NASA even had special missions for the curiousity with the planet and its Face. Many evidence was found through those missions and concluded that it was a landform.

The Scientist are just saying it is an alien is because they want the world to be curious. You are just using your imagination, but truley its just rocks/sadows.

After the technology was getting better, the sent another space ship to see if it is still there. Which it was, so they took many shoots of it. They finally relized that it was just rocks forming or hadows from other objects, and not an alien. they just wanted us (citizens) to think that it is an alien so that busnisess would make money or something good out of it. How can an aliens do that, to make it look like it is 3-D? They probably can but, scientist already figured out it's just the rocks shadows. Our technoloy today can determine what it really is just by one picture and some zooming in.

That's why that face shape mack on mars is not an alien. You can just read a passage about it, to find out what it really is. It's just rocks forming to make a face.

I think that some dust and rocks made this shape occur. Scientist have thier studies. My question is how did this alien form this pop up form. If u say it was a alien does it live under the dust.

In 1998 the camera made a big step and made the image have the best resolution having a stuning 1.56 meter compared to the 43 meters in 1976 they only problem it was in winter and it was really hazy. So in 2001 they took another image it was not even close to ether of the photos in 1976 or 1998

3ab4c11,"The face is not created by aliens and here are a few reasons why. It was a mesa, or maybe even a shadow. but aliens is not a logical reason for this face to exisist on mars.

First, A mesa, a mesa is a very common landform found around the American West. Even so there is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, USA. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. If something on the earth can have a mesa about or the same height had the face on mars it is very likely that it was a mesa.

Secondly, shadows We all knows that shadows can be very deceiving just like in this instance. A shadow could have been reflecting off the viking 1 while it was taking this photo of the ""Face"", or maybe the shadows were from a bigger land form. that was infront, behind, or on the sides casting a shadow onto this mesa.

All in all, From these facts you can conclude that this was a natural landform and not some type of alien thing. If you still do not believe that it was natural. Another spaceship went into space and found the ""Face"" and took a very detailed picture and there were no markings or signs of aliens.               ",3,1,0.8437211513519287

The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. Lastly the picture that the Viking took was not very good quality compared to the pictures took in 2001.

One reason that the Face on Mars was not made by aliens is because the Mars Global Surveyor got the best picture of it in 2001 and it just turned out to be a natural landform. In line 11 it says that ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he also added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

Another reason that the Face was not made by aliens is that the face is the equivalent of as butte or a mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. In paragraph 12 it compares the Face on Mars to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The pictures that the

Mars Global Surveyor took in 2001 were a lot more clearer than the pictures took by the Viking in 1976. In paragraph 10 it says that Malin's team captured an amazing picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixal in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixal in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how bad the quality was in the 1976 photo taken by the Viking. Also, it proves that it was not a good photo and that the 2001 photo shows so much more and is way better quality. Other people might say that in the photo of '98, taken by the cmaera on board the MGS had to pear through wispy clouds to see the face, which made the alien markings hidden by the haze. Then the picture or 2001 proved that there was no alien markings and that the Face was just a landform.

In conclusion, this is why I believe that the Face of Mars was not made by aliens and is just a natural landform. First of all, The Mars Global Surveyor got better quality pictures than the Vikning did. Also, the 2001 picture shows that the Face is the equivalent to a mesa or butte, which are landforms that are common in the American West.

And if we never took those last photos what would of happen to this research project.

As they told us in the story that this as probably just a huge rock formation with shadow giving it the facial feautures to make it look like a person. Some people stil dont belive NASA that that is what it is, they think alliens created that. But those people are probaly wrong becasue those people dont get close looks like NASA and dont get to go into space and look at that these things like NASA gets to do. Also no aliens would just go out on mars and make a random face there for everyone to look at. It pretty much is just a huge rock if you look at it from the pictures and you can tell that the shadows are giving its facial features.

Next, this was all to hopefuly get Mars into some publicity with us and make us pay a little bit more attention now that they hade what some people think is a faec on Mars. And for everyone to try to get Mars this public attention they succeded because everyone started talking about Mars a little more. By the people talking about Mars was not just people it was Hollywod films, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunting grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

Also when the Viking missions were over and the talk started to die down a little NASA went back and took more pictures of that so called face again and more closer this time. When they took the photos the first time it was Mar's cloudy month and you couldnt see the ""face"" very clear and good to get good looks at it. And that wasnt the last time the took another picture of it because on April 5, 1998 ""Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos""(7). Then after taking the such good photos they were going to upload them to a JPL web site where they had thousands of anxioius web surfers wating to see the image(7). Once they posted it and everyone got their look at it on the web site they said "" a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (7).

Last, after all the people though that it was a alien and NASA

thought it was just a shadow NASA was right. Also maybe if we never gave Mars all the public attention you would never know if ths would happen either. And if that last picture that had been ten times better than the originals not been taken then we may not of never knew if it was a alien or the NASA research of just being a shadow.

3addf83,"""The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon."" NASA discovered the face, on Mars, when they took a picture of it in 1976. Some people believe that the face is real and some don't. Although, it might look real, it is just a messa. So far they only have older pictures of it, they also have confimed it a messa, which is common on Mars. A cheif scientist for NASA said it reminded him of Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho. Therefore, if the Face was real then why haven't we gotten more pictures of it.

In contrast, they only have older pictures of it. Very few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian Messa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" However, people thought it was a real face. When the picture went online or on TV, people thought it was ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. Even though some people are defenders of NASA, we still shouldn't give them money to see if there is an actual ancient civilization. If we do we could possibly be putting that money to waste. We should think about if the pictures are real or if they were photoshopped.

However, NASA has confirmed it a messa. Which is a natural landform. Since it is windy or cloudy on Mars this messa could have been pushed around to make it look like a face. Even though we got pictures we would still be able to see things like airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks. We could have actually seen those on the ground. NASA dosen't even pass over the face that often. In contrast, we would not be able to get much information on it. So we should not even worry about how to figure out what it is.

Therefore, when scientists Jim Garvin says it reminds him of ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" we should think about how is he right. When a scientists says something big and important we are listening and comparing something on Earth to Mars means that it could have been caused by erosion. Even though we are just getting pictures of it isn't enough. We could have better pictures now then they did back then. In conclusion, erosion and plains on earth come naturally. We have no idea what that could be made of it could be made of, sand for all we now.

Therefore, we may have confirmed pictures it is a face. But do we have pictures that it is not just darker sand. The face could be anything on Mars. Because their pictures confirmed it a messa, it is a natural landform. In contrast, it formed naturally. Just like how it looks like Middle Butte in Idaho. Which was formed naturally. If this gets people saying that their could be life on Mars we probably would have found it by now.

All in all, if the face was real then why don't we have more advanced pictures of it. NASA only has older pictures of this so called ""Face"", it looks like a natural landform in Idaho. So next time NASA gets people crazy about another ancient alien civilzation, think about how they need to prove it.             ",4,1,0.8495842218399048
3b20650,"There are numerous mysteries of the world that mankind is only on the verge of solving.

From Stonehenge to the Great Pyramids of Giza, historians as well as the public has a surplus of both logical and outrageous theories as to where these icons began.

One example of this is the Face on Mars.

The Face has become a symbol of its own and many believe there to be a correlation with alien life.

However, I, as a scientist, am certain that the Face is simply a natural landform rather than an alien creation due to my knowledge that NASA has taken multiple pictures of the formation and reached this conclusion, NASA has no logical reason to hide evidence if it were present, and because planet Earth has similar formations found in nature.

In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor or MGS image depicted a shocking sight for those down on Earth.

According to ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", an article discussing the mysterious Face, ""...it[Viking 1] spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.""

After their initial reactions, the rational scientists arrived at the conclusion that the sight was in reality, ""...just another Martian mesa"".

They carried on to unveil the finding to the public who some of whom responded claiming the Face is certain proof of Martian life.

NASA has stood by their belief, taking numerous shots of the Face since the original spotting.

As recently as of April 8, 2001; newer photographs using the newest techonology have shown the Face for what it really is.

Jim Garvin, the chief scientist of the Mars Exploration Program, describes tthe intent saying, ""We felt this was important to taxpayers.

We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.

The clarity of these recent pictures is much improved upon those shot by the 1976 Viking.

In fact Garvin again claims, So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

True scientists understand that in order to prove a theory valid, one must utilize multiple data collections rather than one outlier.

NASA has indeed done so in the case of the Face on Mars.

Another reason for believing what I do is the fact that NASA is a professional organization which of course seeks funding and a fair reputation as much as anyone else.

Although many conspiracy theorists claim ""NASA would rather hide"" evidence of life on Mars, this could not be farther from the truth.

According to the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

This is completely logical as recently funding for NASA has only decreased, seemingly along with the public's interest in space exploration.

This being the case, why on Earth would it be sensible for NASA to attempt any sort of cover up regarding evidence of alien life such as the alleged Face on Mars?

Finally, to verify NASA's knowledge that the Face is just a natural landform, is the observation which no one can deny: our planet Earth is abundant in formations such as the Face.

In fact, the mesa which the Face really is, is fairly similar to those found on Earth.

These landforms are particularly common is the western region of North America.

In fact, Jim Garvin states, It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Although Mars and Earth differ is many ways, the two neighboring planets share similar land formations such as these.

The Face is but a specific example of this.

After examining NASA's numerous verification attempts through the means of photography, the fact that NASA has no known motive to hide the alleged ""evidence"", and observing our own planet and its characteristics, it is clear to see that the Face is indeed nothing more than a naturally-occuring landform.

Undeniably fascinating, the Face on Mars is similar to many other wonderous works of nature.

As humans, it is only natural to find these perplexing and interesting.

However, science should not be refuted by simple fascination.

Instead, science should be utilized as a tool to explain the source of these out-of-this-world discoveries.",6,1,0.9000461101531982

The Face is a natural landform because while the first picture was bluried the second was ten times sharper then the original, the photos are reported to be of a natural landform, scientist say it is a mesa (common in the western U.S).

As I stated before, scientist say the second photo is ten times sharper than the original photo. This means it was more accurate. The article showed the second picture to readers at the top third picture to the right. It shows what looks like, and is ,a natural landform. One scientist, Jim Garvin, compared it to a mesa. A mesa is commonly found in the ""western area of the American West.""

In conclusion, the Face is an all natural landform that formed on Mars. I said that it's natural because the photos (which are more accurate than before) are said to have a picture of an natural landform, which they do. The Face can't be a Martian relic as it is a mesa. If it was of Martian descent wouldn't it look more noticable and detailed? The Face is a natural landform because the first picture shown to the masses was bluried and unaccurate while the second was sharper and more accurate than the original, the second photos are reported to show a natural landform, and scientist say the Face is a landform not unsimilar to a mesa (which can be found in Western America).",3,1,0.8144220113754272
3bd10c2,"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars. They were taking photos of Mars to see where Viking 2, the sister ship of Viking 1 could land. As they were taking pictures around Mars they were shocked to see a face on one of the pictures. Scientists didn't take to much consideration aout the face. Thye thought it was just another Martian mesa.

A few days later they released the picture of the face to the world. Since they released the photo it has become a pop icon. It was showed in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and in radio talks. Some people think it the Face is bona flide evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. The people thought they were hiding the fact that life may be on Mars.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took some photos that were ten times sharper then the ones in 1976. As Michael Malin was taking photos, the world was anxious to see what would be the outcome of the photos. When the photos came out on a website it showed a landform. There was really no alien monument after all.

The Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. Not everyone was satisfied that it was just a landform. Some people say that the alien markings were hidden by all the haze. NASA decided to look aagain at Cydonia in 2001.

On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor went to take another look at the landform. During that little exibition, Malin's team captured an extraordianry photo using the camera's maximun resolution. Each pixel in 2001 spans 1.5 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

They compared the three photos and came to conclusion that the picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, common landforms around the American West. Garvin said it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same height as the Face on Mars. Some people are dissapointed that it wasn't a alien artifact, but people still have there hopes that it possibly could be one.       ",2,1,0.8386250734329224

Witch my other idea is that domeone put there face in there and made it stay like that but it could of also had made lots of storms up there turning it into a face then might go away soon. This 3D image is kind of interesting if it is ir nit real

. There mus have been a degree of suprise amongg mission controllers back at the jet propulsion lab when the face shows up againso it could take forever who know but i really think thats nothing or no big deal but it could.

3c126dc,"The 'Face' in Space

The Face is a bonafide example of a natural landform. However, some people say that it is an ancient artifact that proves that there is life on Mars. Scientists have said that the Face is just another buttle or Martian mesa, that the Face is just another natural landform and there isn't a face at all. It is just a common landform.

Even if the masses aren't satisfied, the Face will remain just a buttle or Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common enough around Cydonia, the place where the Face was found. The Face only has shadows that make it appear like a face. Conspiracy theorists say that the Face might be evidence of ancient civilization on Mars, but defenders of NASA's budget beg to differ.

Truly, the face is just a natural landform.

As the text states ""There wasn't an alien monument after all.""The passage also reads that Malin sent a team to capture a more clear picture of the Face. Some said that there might have been hidden alien markings, and they were proven wrong. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to get a clear picture of the Face. As it turns out, there really wasn't a alien monument after all.

In the beginning, there was no face to begin with. The Face only had unusual shadows that made it look like a face. NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see and here in the passage it reads ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" This shows that there wasn't a face, just an illusion.

There is the arguement that the Face is evidence of an ancient civilization. At the time the picture of the Face was taken, it was winter. Perhaps the alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze. Mission controllers even looked again. On a cloudless, summer day, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take the another picture, in hope there was something that they didn't see. Even so, the scientists were proven right again. The Face was really a mesa, a landform common in Cydonia.

In conclusion, the Face turned out to be a common landform. Just another buttle, another landform, another rock formation, not really a face at all. There is no evidence that there was even a civilization and there wasn't even evidence that there was life to begin with! Again, there could have been alien markings that were covered by the haze, and there could have been life on Mars. Let us face the facts though; in this reality; there isn't a face on Mars, there isn't a civilization on Mars and it is just another landform. ",4,1,0.8852254152297974
3c13b79,"Even after proven wrong, people are still thinking that the face on mars is an actual alien made face. In paragraph 10 it staes that on April 5th 1998 a global surveyor flew over Cydonia with a camera 10 times sharper than the photo taken in the original 1976 picture, shown to prove that on this picture the closer up it looks less like a face. But this wasn't the end of the research.

The reaseach continues but with an even better camera to try and prove all of the conspiracy believing people wrong. In paragraph 11 it states that the new digital image taken in 2001, was a 3 times bigger sized camera from the 1998 photo, and it was sharper than ever. This image spans over 1.56 meters! If this ""face"" was made by aliens, then why were there no artifacts found around the photograph? The extremely high def. picture would have shown said artifacts. But there are still specticals believing otherwise.

The pictures are proven to be a natural born landform, pictures don't lie. Yes, maybe if we were ON Mars we would find some new facts to maybe prove one anothers views even more, but for right now NASA is winning. Conspiracy theories are theories. Picture evidence is pure fact shown to a persons face.

Just like the belief in wether or not earth and people were made by god or science. They're both theories that's why people have to have ""faith"" in what they believe. The Big Bang theory for example is a theory because it doesn't have enough evidence to be proven that it legitimately happened. It goes the same with religion.

In conclusion, people all have thir different beliefs. Some believe that the ""face"" was alien made, some believe it's natural born. But no matter what people believe, fact is fact.

NASA sent Viking 1 to circle the planet to take picture, record data, and searching for possible lasing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. But on it voyage it spotted a figure shaped like a human face. This was a start to see if life on mars was even possible.

As NASA did research on the figure they ran tests, and did many other things to collect data form the subject. They unveiled the image for people all around the world to see. And that wasnt exactly a good idea. It caused many complications and conflict. But that didnt stop us from doing more research with the figure. Yes, some scientists believed that face resembled or was an alien artifact. But our proof, such as pictures, data, and many other things object that matter. The Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a picture of the human faced shaped object, in the article it states

As many other scientists have figured out.

In addition to the stated proof above, many people disagree with us. The scientific facts are not enough for people to believe. So even after the pictures were taken and the evidece was proven Many were still not satistifed. Only becasue The face of Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April, producing a thin wispy layer of clouds that you had to peer through to see the face. So others controdicted and thought ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" But they have a right to think this. But NASA and many other scientific people have took the time to find the answers. They came up with reasonable, testable answers that can be proven to be right. The face is in deed just a natural land form. I hope that the peope who are reading this can take time to reconsider the other outcomes of this shadowy human shaped face figure and think about the data and answer that were found and see what others went through to prove that their case was a true form of evidence proving what they think this figure is.

In 1976 the Viking 1 was taking pictures looking for a landing spot for its sister ship Viking 2. The Viking 1 happened to take a picture of a mesa and it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh and everybody believed it was created by aliens. The technology back in 1976 was not as good as it was in 1988 and 2001. When the picture was taken in 1976 it looked like a face. The picture taken in 1988 the picture was more clear and just looked like a mesa.

Cameras' pixels in 2001 spanned over 1.56 meters.

Also NASA has way more knowledge about it than people who thnks its an Egyptian Pharaoh created by aliens. The text states scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common around Cyndonia. Conspiracy theorists sometimes can go to far with things that can catch peoples attention. Therefore some of the things they say may not be true.

Did they go onto Mars and looked closley at the face? If it was an artifact made by aliens what did they make the face out of.

The scientist sya the face looks like an Egptian but in 2001 it doesn't look like an Egptian anymore.

The scientist used a machine that can see if there were any objects, like airplanes in the picture you would see it cause of the machine. The face on Mars could just be an uncommon landform. Its probably not an artifact made by aliens because the face wasn't showing that much in 1976. In 1998 the face was getting clear but in 2001 the face was disappearing beacause of the cracks on the face.

3d098ec,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, and does not prove that there is alien life on Mars. The Face was created simply by poor camera quality and an optical illusion. The later pictures of the Face taken in 1998 and 2001 prove this theory even further. If you look at the later pictures, you can clearly see that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation. NASA is also in support of finding alien life, so they would have no reason in trying to disprove that aliens are not real. So, the face is nothing more than an optical illusion, and not something created by aliens.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than an optical illusion and a natural formation working together. If you look at the picture of the Face from 1976, then it is very convincing proof that the face was the work of aliens. However, the picture of the Face that was taken in 2001 shows that the Face is simply a rock formation with shadows where the eyes and mouth should be. This is also proven with the picture that was taken in 1998. Even though there is clouds over the Face, you can still tell that there is no alien creation in the picture. Garvin brings up a comparison of the Face to a ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" which is a ""lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" By drawing this comparison, it gives us something we can easily compare the Face to on Earth. People don't claim that the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain"" was created by aliens, yet it is easily comparable to the Face.

Alien life on Mars would support NASA. It would bring great attention to the space program, and more funding. If NASA were to find aliens, they wouldn't hide it from the public. Whenever the picture was first taken in 1976, NASA released it to the public only a few days after it was taken. Although the picture had a theory to disprove that it was the creation of aliens along with it, NASA still released it almost immediatly. This is proof that NASA is in support of finding alien life becuase they were not afraid to release something that could possibly prove it. Even after NASA ended the Viking missions, they still went back to take more photos of the Face. This would either prove the conspiracy theorists even more, due to advancments in technology which would allow for higher resolution photos, or it would prove NASA's theory that shadows were creating the optical illusion. The pictures helped the case of the latter. Because of how much clearer the picture taken in 1998 is compared to the picture taken in 1976, you are able to see much more detail of the Face, and can easily tell that it is just a mesa. Conspiricy theorists claimed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze in the picture, which would later be disproved by the very clear picture taken in 2001. So, if NASA were not in support of finding alien life, why would they release three pictures that could possibly prove alien life?

In conclusion, the face was not created by aliens. NASA is also not trying to hide any evidence for alien life on Mars, so if this were the creation of aliens, NASA would fully support it. NASA released three photos of the Face, all which had the possibility of proving that it was the creation of aliens, yet they still released them.

They accused us of hiding the fact that there was an alien civilization on the Red Planet, and that the picture is a monument. All we want to do here at NASA is inform skeptics that they are severely mistaken.

First of all, we revealed the information because we wanted the public to be informed, and we wanted to not hide anything. All the skeptics should stop and realize that us revealing partial information is just illogical. If we revealed the picture, it's because we wanted people to know about it. As we said earlier, the face-type shape is ""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" We gave you the full truth.

As well as us giving you full information, we actually would be glad to tell the public about ancient martian civilizations. NASA would benefit greatly from something like that. You see, we aren't getting funded as well as we would like. So something as interesting as alien life-forms would definitely get us more money to explore more. Simply put, the public's thirst for exciting information would drive the government to fund us. Unfortunately, the face is just a creation of nature, but we'll be more than glad to inform you if we ever find signs of alien life.

In addition to the fact that NASA is always glad to provide information, we took very clear pictures that show just a desolate mound of rock that is naturally made.

Thats a sign. Someone is trying to talk and say something. And it isn't just a natural land form. That shows in the change in the second to third one.

What about weathering? That could have been that reasoning for happening.

Yes it could but weathering take hunderds to thousands of years so thats not possible between 25 years.

There is no right or wrong just yet but more reasoning pointing to non-natural landforming than there is alien civilazation. Reading the entire story was almost wasteful because i didn't need it for my claim. My thesis is still an ancient alien civilization.   ",1,1,0.6588362455368042
3d98d24,"Is the face on Mars alien or just another natrual landform? Do we know if Mars isn't crawling with extra-terrestial beings? Yes. Yes we do. In the following paragraphs I will prove the fact that the face on Mars if in fact just a natrually formed landform. Then I will say why many people speculate if it is alien.

To begin with, many people say the face on mars could be a sign of alien life and that extra-terretial beings are calling out to us with their mound-like pyramids. It can't be possible. First, it is proven that there are no signs of any alien markings on it. The text says,""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" Second, it has been proven that it is similar to many mesa or buttes in the western united states. The text says,"" what the picture actually shows is the Martian equizelant of a butte or a mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Lastly, the face has been taken over and over again and every time it becomes clearer and clearer every time. This is because the technology has started getting better so the world can stat proving things to be false. One example, is the Martian face.

To conclude, many speculations have been made this is resonable because the picture wasn't originally clear and the second one was taken with clouds in the Martian atmosphere, but still the third picture shows that scientifaclly it is only a landform on the palnet of mars.",3,1,0.867644190788269
3dcd7e8,"The story unmasking the face is telling us how they should believe that this face was made by so maney aliens but it was a scientist . As the story goes on the story say this face was made in1976 to 2001 .I think this story is trying to tell us that this story is real because of how it's sounding .I think that this story is really make believe because they said this was made by aliens . April 5,198 when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time , michael malin and his orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than original viking photos . Thousands of anxious web sufers were waitimg when the image first appeared on a JPL web sitr , revealing .... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all .

but not everyone was satisfied . The face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martain latitude where it was winter in april '98----- a cloudy tie of year on the red plantes . The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face . Perhaps ,said skeptics aliens markings were hidden by haze .. What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa ---landforms common arounf the american west .",1,1,0.8586620688438416
3dce3b5,"I think that it's a Martian mesa. I think that its a just a bunch of rocks put together. If there was life there, it would probally be something else instead of the face. If there was life on mars we would have probably meet them by now and probaly do an invation. We would have found them by now if they was life. And the first picture was from a distence and could barily be seen.

Erosion probaly made it to the way it is, because on the top of Mars there is ice. The scientists took pictures over time as technology started to become for advanced. The human head was formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and, mouth. And people couldnt even see what it really was. The sicentists can just discern thing ina a digitial image 3 time bigger than the pixel.

People can just take photos of the plantet Mars and check if there is? The Martian is the same as a butte or a mesa. They dont pass overr the Face not that often. JPL website puts the picture of the face and there was no alien monument after all. The caption when the NASA unveiled the image for all to see wasm,"" huge rock formation which resembles a human head"". ",2,1,0.8546677827835083
3dcfa42,"I believe that the face on Mars is just a natural landform because NASA says it looks like it was formed by shadows giving the illusion eyes, nose, and a mouth, and because they say there was no alien monument after all, also because the picture actually means something else.

NASA says that it looks like it was formed by shadows giving the illusion eyes, nose, and a mouth. I believe this shows that it is not something created by aliens it is just simply a natural landform.

NASA also says that there was no alien monument after all because as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyrimids or even small shacks you would be able to identify what they are.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Landforms common around the American west. It reminds scientist Jim Garvin most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also says that it is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

This is why i believe that the Face on Mars is not somthing created by aliens it is simply just a natural landform because the shadows give it the eyes, nose, and mouth, Also because there is no alien monument after, and because the picture actually means something else.

By Dariontai White

Do you think that the face is from an Alien? I do. and if you keep reading i can tell you why.

I think it's just a human from a long time ago. My evidence is this quote from the text ""NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible lamding sites for its isster ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" This quote explains its self, and thats's why i think its a human.

I think it just a natural landform, and i got a quote to back it up. My quote is ""Thousands of anxious we surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" and that quote tells you that it was a natural landform after all.

My last reason why I think its a landform is because of the quote that say's ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent ro a buttle or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""

In conclusion, if anyone ask me what I think it is My answer would be a natural landform, and if they ask me how do i know i have evidence.",1,1,0.8211264610290527
3e13ec4,"The ""Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform. The ""Face on Mars"" was described at first as a ""Egyption Pharaoh"", when really it resembled the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. If there were aliens who did make the monument, we would have not exposed this new information to the world, and have some scared, or excited about top secret information like this.

The natural landform must have been created by a shuttle landing,or has been here before we've known it. According to our team in NASA "" The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle,or mesa"", as I have said at the beginning, also if the landform were to be created by aliens there would have been some type of physical evidence that something, or someone would have/had been there before us.

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA explained "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.""

meaning, as soon as there was a shot so our supporters could make out, the picture was sent in to them. But because our supporters were not as satisfied of the picture, and thought they were gonna have some type of sy-fy picture to show them, they were sadly mistaken. They also have to realize and understand that information exposed to the world like that would not only put them in jepeordy,but us and our jobs too.",2,1,0.9030081033706665
3e1969d,"When they got on Mars they realized that it looked like a human face and they wanted to know if it was left by an alien or something. In order for the face to be created by aliens we would have to know that they exist. We would have to actually know that aliens made the face on Mars, we would have to have evidence that they exist. In order to know that the face is a natural landform we would have to do a lot of research stating that maybe something or someone made the face. Scientist would have to make sure that it is a face and not something else. Scientist figured that is was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, the unusual shadows made it look like an Egyptiazn Pharaoh. They would have to do research to see if aliens left it there or if its something that someone or something left on Mars. In order to find out if it's a face they would have to make conclusions about what it may be. They figured that it did not have anything to do with aliens but they were not sure if it was true or not they wanted to know if alien marking were hidden by haze. ",1,1,0.8393488526344299
3e1faa5,"Not one human has ever seen a living species in Mars or in any planet. In 1976 an odd feature appeared on Mars. Many people think that it looks like a human face. These people believe that the odd feature could be an alien living on Mars.

The news has been spreading around that the ""face on Mars"" is a creature living in space. I don't believe that aliens are real. Aliens are a figure that someone made up a long time ago hoping that their were more people in the Universe. I know this because if there were aliens in the Universe, someone probably would have already found one.

A lot of odd objects float around in space. The face that people are seeing could just be a meteor. Meteors float around the Universe just trying to make problems. The meteor could have blasted into Mars and created the face like feature. Things like this are not very rare. Meteors have rocketed into Earth a great number of times.

I also believe in Jesus. I believe in every single detail the Bible says. The face could be Jesus showing people that he is watching us. Everything in the Bible has either already happend or will happen in the future. Aliens are not in the Bible, therefore, I don't believe they exist.

If aliens really do exist we would have already found one. Humans have thought aliens are real for hundreds of years. The object could be a natural object like a meteor. Meteors pass through the Universe every single day. What makes this object different? Nothing make the object different. Jesus Christ has all of the creatures we need to know about in the Bible. Aliens are just not one of them.                  ",1,1,0.7084730863571167
3ec8931,"Aliens vs. Knowledge

Twenty-five years before 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a landform in the shape of a face on Mars's surface. This, after being released to the media, caused an uprising of speculations. Did aliens make this? Were there other beings on other planets? Are we not alone?

A famous scientist once said that we researched for other life on other planets because humans didn't want to be alone in this vast galaxy. He also said that it could cause either fear or excitement. The media wanted to grab the attention of the common people, and to do that they needed something extraordinary. The media spins the truth to benefit their needs. You can't believe everything they say because all they can do is gain by your speculation.

NASA hardly thought this was the work of aliens. They didn't want the people to think they were lying, they wanted to seek the truth. Even if they were hiding something, they could only ever lose everything for covering it up. More attention on the dying out NASA program would gain the support and money to fund them. So, on April 5, 1998, they sent another spacecraft to take pictures of the landform.

Not everyone thought the image that came up, the one of a landform, sufficed. They argued that it was probably too hazy and that the image wasn't a reliable resource. They said that the haze was blocking the alien markings.

Again, NASA sent another spacecraft in 2001 to take better pictures in different angles. The picture showed a landform much like a butte or mesa here on Earth. Some people stated that it was a conspiracy.

Mars has unique quirks like every planet. Here on earth we have natural landforms such as a mesa, and mountains, and rivers. Mars isn't much different.

Scientists have special catogories for classifying a planet, and Pluto did not meet those requirements. So, every planet has to have at least one thing in common with another. Just beacause Mars is a different planet, doesn't mean that it can't have landforms much like those on Earth.

To say that one planet has aliens because of a landform, is to say that we are aliens as well. Don't we have mountains? Yes, you might say, but it's because of tectonic plates pushing against each other. Science has taught us many things, so now we know something foreign to people back then.

Take Christopher Columbus as in example. Before he sailed the ocean, everyone thought that the earth was flat. After he disproved the theory, people saw the earth for what it was: a round, water planet. Another great example would be Galileo, who disproved the theory that Earth was the center of the galaxy and the sun and everything else rotated around it. People had to have curiosity, and the willpower to go on with these expeditions. After they disproved a theory, it made more sense, and the world around us just is. Now, we don't question on how the mountains were made. We don't question on why we have day and night.

We are more educated now, but there are still things we haven't learned. That's why people should have a more open mind about finding the truth. Once we find the truth, we'll move on to bigger things and so on and so on. This mystery is one which piques people's interest, but turning to myth and false facts isn't the way to go. Exploring and learning from new innovations is what makes scientists who they are. They took the time to go through the process of being a certified scientist. To say you are smarter than one is disrespectful towards them, saying all their hard work was worth nothing.

So, to summarize, aliens did not make the landform on Mars. It was a natural occurence that got blown up into bigger proportions because the media wanted to satisfy their own needs to get profit. NASA knows what they are saying, and we should respect their statements until we ,for sure, know ourselves that the statement is false.          ",5,1,0.6384688019752502
3ed4755,If you thimk it is a alien civilisation you are mistaken. If you think it is where is the evadence like houses. I think it is a natural land like we have here on earth. It can be an astriod hiting the earth or it could very well be a mountain like we have on earth. Another thing i think it could be is an un earupted valcanneo like an other thing we have on earth. Also it can be where the inside of the planit has bin pushed out to cause a natural land form. There can also be other things it can be. The people that think that it is an alien civilisation they have to back there rason up with a lot of information and very detaild information to get me on there side. Even then I probibly wont believe them it would have to be a very low chance i would take there side.,2,1,0.5252261161804199
3f1888d,"Many people thought that the face on Mars was created by aliens. I do not agree with that statement because there is no evidence supporting that theory. However, there is evidence supporting that the face is merely a landform that was created naturally. Throughout the article, it shares ideas from NASA, which is the foundation that discovered the face on Mars in the first place.

The first statement that the article makes about the face being a natural landform is, ""New high-resolution images and 3D alimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" This one statement shows that NASA, one of the biggest names in space industry, believes the face is only a mesa. The people back in the Jet Propulsion Lab must have been surprised to see such a startling sight, but luckily NASA provides more information to show that the face is only a simple landform.

The text provides a caption from the message unveiled by NASA. The caption states, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This exact caption says the exact proof that the face is clearly just a rock formation. Every person should already know how shadows can, well, cast shadows that may give illusions of other objects.

Some people that believe in aliens may say that it would be crazy to think that a rock formation and shadows could form the illusion of a face, but I've seen shadows that are casted when the sun hits them just right. Isn't it completely logical that the sun could hit the shadows to fill the holes in the rocks? I sure believe so.

The last quote I would like to give as my evidence is, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you couold see what they were!"" This single statement shows that the cameras they were using to the maximum resolution, would in fact show if there was actually an alien artifact on the planet. But the strongest possible photo showed no ancient alien artifacts. It only showed a natural rock formation with shadows that formed what appeared to be a face.   ",4,1,0.8965798616409302
3f3ff43,"My name is Proffesor Yado, and my colleague and I were discussing on the infamous ""Face on Mars"". My colleague believes in superstition and conspiracies so he stated that the face on Mars must be of extraterrestrial origin. I said that was porposterous, but my colleague continued to try and convince me to no availe. I told my colleague there are many reasons why the some scientists and people thought the ""Face on Mars"" looked like a face. I then procedded to tell him my reasons.

First off, cameras at the time were not as advanced as they are today. The cameras of the day would ""distort the image and it would only capture the major features of the butte or mesa. The most recent image taken of the ""Face on Mars"" in 2001 looks very different from the original image taken in 1976. If there was a actual structure left by aliens, modern cameras would be able to see it. The the more modern cameras of today are able to see the more defining features of a object.

Secondly humans are remarkably good at seeing faces when there is not one there. When you look at a wall socket you can see what resembles a face when there is not one there. It is the same thing with the ""Face on Mars"". With the aid of shadows from the Sun, are ability to see faces when none are there, and the angle the picture was taken, the butte or mesa looks remarkably like a face or some alien made structure.

In response to what I said my colleague had some things to say to try and disprove me. Due to my colleague believing in superstition and conspiracies he believed NASA and the government are hiding the truth from us. He stated they were hiding this from us because of what happened with H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds, which caused a massive panic. The government don't want another mass panic so they have been keeping us away from the truth that aliens exist. My colleague also stated that possibly alien markings were hidden by haze as some other theorists thing so. I thought that was perpostourous but my colleague still believed the theory of aliens existing.

Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the ""Face on Mars"" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the ""Face on Mars"" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the ""Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.",4,1,0.8231273889541626
3f4c511,"The Natural Face

The Face is just a natural landform. I work as a scientist at NASA, and I know that the image taken of the face was not created by aliens. The article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" tells how the truth is revealed. I can prove that the Face is just a landform and not some superstitious icon.

First of all, back in 1976, the quality of pictures and images probably aren't going to be that outstanding. The pictures are blurry and they are the first documented pictures of that landform. I know this because paragraph seven states, "" And so on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Later in paragraph seven, the text says,

There was no alien monument after all."" This is why the Viking's pictures aren't credible sources, and that people shouldn't trust the Face in that picture.

Now, some might say, back then, that the alien markings are hidden by the haze. The text in paragraph eight says why,""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" However, later pictures still prove that the alien creation was not real.

The MGS images prove that the Face is just another landform on Mars. This is because the MGS was able to get another photo. Paragraph 10 states, Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" At a moment like that, the time for taking a picture is perfect.

To add on to that cloudless day, the photo taken is eaxtroardinary. In paragraph 10 Garvin says, """"Malin's team captured an extroardinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."""" The paragraph also states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The quality is exceptionally clearer than the picture taken in 1976. The cracks and clear image show that there aren't any aliens, but that the Face is nothing but a huge rock formation.

In conclusion, the Face is just a rock formation on Mars. Back in 1976, the quality of pictures weren't that great. Through time though, the quality of pictures did get better, and the MGS was able to take a picture of the Face on April 8th, 2001, showing that it was a rock, or, ""The Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West,"" as paragraph 12 says. The Face is a landform, not an alien creation.",4,1,0.8967993259429932

What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face. The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth. If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face. But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away. So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad. It's nothing more than just a natural landform and a picture taken at the right moment.",2,1,0.9047986268997192

The face on Mars is not actually a face. It is probably holes in the rock of the ground just shaped perfectly like a face underground. Even if there was a body burried under there you wouldnt be able to see the face if you dont see the body.

Why hasnt NASA unburried this object or crater to see if it actually is a body. This face is only a theory towards Mars having an ancient civilazation. The object there isnt a face, it is only a natural landform.

Have you heard of electromagnetic force fields? If not, they are locations on earth in which it radiates high frequencies and no animaml can live on this land. Human could for awhile but it might make you go insane. Do you think these are just alien sites that we cant handle? Most likely not, it is natural within earth. Our planets has its own different things throughout it and Mars could just have craters everywhere. This one just happens to be captured and looked like a face.

Do not believe everything you hear or see because our mind can trick us. Natural landforms come in all different shapes and sizes. Next time you think there is a face in the ground remember that its not actually a face.   ",2,1,0.8250777721405029
3fa57a6,"In 1976, NASA discovered a land formation that looks like a face and since then it has become a national icon. Conspiracy theorists think that we at NASA are hiding something. They think it was created by aliens. We know that it wasn't though because after all we're the experts here. If we were hiding something, why wouldn't we release it to make more money? We have technology and the smarts to prove people wrong that think it was created by an alien. The conspiracy theorists are wrong.

As better technology is developed and our images take on a higher resolution we have proof that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a land formation with an odd shadow. In 1976, we first discovered the ""Face on Mars"" using the Viking 1, but we couldnt really tell what it was because the resolution wasn't that good. Then in 1998, the technology developed over the span of 22 years, the resolution became better, and we could sort of tell what it was. Then in 2001, we really discovered what it was because the technology was way bettter and we could see a 3D image of it. As technology developed we could really start to tell that it was in fact a mesa. Proving that the people were wrong and that they don't have as advanced technology as we do.

The conspiracy theorists were once again wrong. They just look off of the images NASA puts out and think of the most bizzare theory and release it. When we had the MGS fly over Cydonia (where the ""Face on Mars"" is located) on April 5, 1998, he snapped pictures and really discovered it wasn't an alien formation. Then, many people disagreed with our logic again and said that since it was a cloudy time in April '98 on mars, that the alien markings were hidden by haze. We then went for a second run on April 8, 2001, ""a cloudless summer day"" and captured the photo using the the camera's maximum resolution, and still didn't see any alien markings. They were yet again wrong and this proves that it isn't an alien formation.

In the end, the picture really shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. These landforms are much like the ones we see on Earth. They're common on almost every planet. What Garvin says is completely true, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These formations are just another land formation. The people who thought they were alien markings are just trying to get attention.

After all, we at NASA have always had the best technology to look into space and at other planets. People have tried to prove us wrong and we always come out on top of things. We've proven them wrong with images, other formations on Earth that are equivalent to formations on Mars, and the knowledge that we have. The people shouldn't question it because if it really was an alien marking we'd share it with the public. These theories that it's an alien marking are wrong and we've proven this.

3faada7,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" NASA finds a rock on Mars that looks like a human face. When people first see this they go crazy and jump to conclusions saying it's an alien. When I say going crazy I mean that they put this rock face in all kinds of movies and magazines. The people later find out, it's not an alien after all. After finding this out, people still find a way to believe that the face isn't a landform.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photo. This photo revealed a natural landform. The camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and people said alien markings were hidden in the haze. On April 8,2001, they got an even better picture of the rock. The picture shows the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa which is a landform common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho,"" says Garvin. The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion, the last picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken on a cloudless day and if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were. The first two pictures may not have been great but after the last picture that was taken, all evidence points to the face on Mars just being a landform and not an artifact of aliens. Also, the face is Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa, which is landforms common around the American West such as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the height of the Face on Mars. All real evidence leads us to the conclusion that the face on Mars is just a landform. ",3,1,0.8215773105621338
3fb7516,"I am here to discuss with you the topic of the landform on Mars. Yes, it's the one shaped like a human face. I have been getting many claims of it being a monument built by ancient life on Mars. Believe us, here at NASA we would love for the claims of alien life to be true, but we've been given substantial information that those claims are incorrect. There are many reasons why these claims are invalid. First of all, landforms like the so-called face appear on our home planet it would be easy to find; secondly the appearance of a face was given merely by the casting of shadows over the surface over the red plant; and lastly, the intensely zoomed in picture showed no sign of anything that would hint at any type of civilization.

Here on Earth, we have tons of natural landforms created by erosion, glaciers, and the sea. The landform on Mars appears to be a mesa, a landform that happens to be very common in the western area of America. The climate of Mars can be quite similar to that of the West, and that hints to us that because of the hot climate that usually occurs with the sun shining on Mars, this landmark has formed only because of the climate and conditions of the area. It is a reasonable idea to consider and should be proof enough, but there are still some sceptics so I will continue.

Some may say, even if it was a natural landform, how on Earth does it look exactly like a human face? Well first of all, people see what they wish to see. They think it's a face because it is such a fascinating and fantastic thing to think of. ""A human face on Mars?! No way!"" The landform isn't actually shaped like a face, it is merely the shadows that are cast on it that cause the appearance of it being a face. However, upon closer inspection by NASA the landform was revealed merely to be a completely normal patch of land, nothing special at all.

If all of what I'm saying isn't enough to convince you, I have got one more important point to make. NASA has gone to extensive lengths to examine this landform that has caused such a big fuss among the people. In the April of 2008, scientists set out to explore the face of Mars once more. It was an apparently cloudless day and it was that day that they took the picture. The picture was zoomed in as far as it could have been, so that anything on the face of the planet could be seen. There weren't any signs of life, no tents where extra-terrestrial life would sleep and no proof of anything building this landform.

To sum all of this up, there is simply just no way that this landform could have been built by alien life. There are too many facts and too much research done on this landform, we know all there is to know and what we can say for sure is, there is simply no way the Face was createed by Aliens. You'll just have to face the facts and wonder how on earth this picture managed to look exactly like a human face. The mystery was fun while it lasted, but now that we have the facts, it is time to lay this case to rest.",5,1,0.8598875999450684
3fdf204,"Back in 1976 while NASA's Viking 1 space craft was flying around Mars near the Cydonia region when it snapped a picture of an odd landform that baffled scientist for years. It had come across a mesa that resembled a face. NASA said that it was just an optical illusion to make it look like a face. When NASA first revealed it to the public it drew some attetion in the entire country. It had a movie, books and was even in every grocery store check out aisle for 25 years.

NASA then began prioitizing photogaphing Cydonia to see if it was an alien artifact or not. They then sent another spacecraft eighteen years after the Viking missions.They took a better picture of the face as soon as they could, even though it wasn't a clear picture and was taken during the cloudy season on the Red Planet they seen that it was not a face but a landform istead.

There are many reasons why this was a landform and not an alien monument as even the first NASA report said that the shadows were just an optical illousion to make it look like something it is not. Many scientist then said that the face was like a butte that was located in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. In 2001 NASA sent another spacecraft into space and got an even better picture of the mesa and put an end to the conspiricies that said that the mesa was a face.

In conclusion, the ""face"" had attracted alot of attention to NASA and Mars as it became a major pop culture refference.That then began to deminish as NASA's photographing technolegy got better they then revealed that it was a butte that was just an optical illuosion.There were so many facts to debunk the myth that NASA's deffenders hoped that it was an alien artifact so that they could get more money.",3,1,0.8424347043037415
3ff2177,"Some people think that the Face is an artifact from aliens, but the fact is, it's a natural landform. Natural things happen everywhere, so seeing something that happens to look like a face should not be automaticlly assumed to be from aliens. After all, Earth has some things that look odd or familiar to our daily life! NASA is sure that this phenomenon is not from alien activity. Wouldn't you think NASA would tell us if it was?

The Face is just a huge rock formation from the Red Planet. The shadows from at the angle it was taken gives it the effect of human features (3). They released the photo to ""engage the public and attrack attention to Mars"" (3). People have just gave it such an off turning idea that gives it even more attention than intended. People made such a huge deal out of it that more and more people think that there is aliens existance on Mars.

For the beliefs that the fog that appeared in another photo was due to alien activity; fog happens on Earth too. If we take this even farther, it could have just been that the lens were fogged up, or the area was getting something like precipitation. I do not know for sure, but NASA has been said to have some of the most high quality equipment. I am more willing to believe that it is a fog and not a problem with the equipment (7). Although anything could break at anytime, I beileve that the fog was just a natural thing and not something overall crazy.

NASA's equipment is probably more successful than many would think. If you look at one of the older pictures of the Face, you can obviously see that it is not, whatsoever, the most high caliber evidence. Looking at a recent photo may help you or others see that it is indeed a natural process happening. I believe that most who have a say in what the picture looks like, did not see what was happening in that moment in which the picture was taken. Therefore, making the guess that the lens may have broke, or the foresaken fact that it is just fog (10).

In conclusion, I beilieve everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I like to think the more logical side of this debate. More and more people can do as much research as they please, but with facts know that; the Face is just a landform, that fog can happen just about everywhere, and the fact that NASA has high caliber equipment. I would like to hope that if there was a signal of alien activity, that NASA personal would tell us so we would know how to address the problem.",4,1,0.806292712688446

With new high-resolution images and 3Daltimetry from NASA's Mars global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.

Because of NASA's budget we wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars, but there is not. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

This so called Face on Mars is just a huge rock formation that resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth.

On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look, and capture an extraordianary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

The Face looks similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho. A lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. So as you can see, the Face on Mars is nothing more than a large rock formation, and is not a face at all.   ",3,1,0.8833913803100586
409deea,"Back when Viking 1 took the original photo of the Face on Mars, people have thought that it was an alien symbol. NASA as since debunked this theory. With the improved pictures from the Mars Global surveyor, it is very clear to see that it is a natural landform, just like those on Earth. The Face on Mars is easily identified as a natural landform. The Face on Mars cannot be an alien artifact because it has been proven to be a mesa by photographs, is thought to be alien because of movies and magazines, and was created by shadows.

One of the best ways to prove that things exist is through pictures. This was shown to be true by the most recent picture of the Face, back in April 8, 2001. By this most recent picture, it is clear to see that the ""eyes and nose"" of the Face were created by shadows casted by the rock formations. With the 1998 picture, it was thought that something might be hidden behind the clouds present that day. Since this most recent picture was taken on a clear day, there is no way that it could be confused for something else, or anything could be hidden.

Along with clear photographs, the Face is only relevant because of theorist and popular culture. Like the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" says, ""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon."" The author goes on to say that it has starred in a movie, books, and magazines.

If the Face hadn't become so famous, it is possible that theorist wouldn't even have claimed it as alien artifact.

The final reason that the Face couldn't be a face is because it was created by shadows. If the face had been viewed by the Viking 1 on a different day, it is possible that nobody would have thought that it was a face. As can be seen by the different photos, which were likely taken at different times of day, the shadows are much less prevolent on the mesa. It is still recognizable as the Face, but only very slightly. Along with that, there are also many also possible landforms that, under the right circumstances, looks like a face because of shadows.

Based on all of the evidence, it is impossible to think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Even with all of the pictures taken, and most references being from the media, and how the creation was based on the time of day, it is difficult to believe that people still believe this. While some people might still believe this, there are many ways that this has been proven wrong. These are just a few of them.",4,1,0.9152505397796631

Reasons such as the landform being compared to natural, earth landforms and it has similar characteristics as earth lanforms help prove this is true.

The landform was compared to a butte or a messa. This means it is quite similar to earthly landforms and may have occured due to something that happened on Mars. The face on Mars is comapared one main earth landform that was mentioned. The landform is Middle Butte, which is located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It was a lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa.

The face on Mars had the same look and height as a Earth landform, a mesa. It is true that there is an unusual shape to the face on Mars, there are similar occurances that happen on Earth. Though this happens on Earth, people don't say that these Earth landforms were made by aliens.

This landform is just like other occurances on seperate planets that resemble Earth landforms. Even though the landform resembles a human face, it doesn't mean the landform is an alien's doing.

The now famous image of Mars took a name The Face. Now twenty-two years later NASA tries again at a picture of The Face. The picture turns out good, but a cloud blocks a part of the image. The people aren't happy and they get NASA, three years later to get another picture, and it it shows no evidence of an alien carved face. The talk of The Face soon dies down.

I, on the other hand, do not agree. of course they asked me for my argument, and I will give one as requested.

The Viking 1 spacecraft caught a very blury image of the formation. It did resemble a human face, and with a second picture taken in 1998, it still represented just that. The 1998 picture was clearer, but was still missing the detail needed to point out anything proving the alien relations. Not everyone was satisfied with that image either, so there was another search, and an image taken at very high quality in 2001 shows absolutely not relation of alien creation having to do with the formation. It is shown just to be another mesa, simply like the coincidental structures we have here on earth.

My argument is simply that with what material we have, all things point to another mesa, not an alien creation. The final photo in '01 has high quality, and without showing evidence of alien relations, there is no way that I am to believe it was formed by aliens.",3,1,0.8185322284698486

Others believe it is a butte or a mesa, which are land formations around the American West. The image of the ""face"" looks just like a hill or rounded very small mountaion top. The ""face"" even has changed over the years. Many things change by erosion or the weather,so i believe it is just a mesa that has changed over the years. The markings were not hidden by some kind of an ""alien haze"" it was simply the weather. Planets other than earth have diferent kind of weathers also. There is something in the United States that is simulaur to the ""face"", it is a small lava doom and it is the same height as the ""face"".

Scientist believed that there is somekind of an alien face on Mars, but there isnt it is just a mesa or a butte. Which is a small landmass. If there was an ancient civilization or still life on Mars, we would be able to see it, unless they are just great at hinding. Even if there were civilzations on Mars wouldn't we be able to see more artifacts? The land mass has also changed in the pass years, probably by ersion or wether. There is also shadows that are reflectind over the land mass, to show its distinct characterristics, like the nose, mouth, and eyes. ",3,1,0.8882213830947876
40d42ad,"The ""Face On Mars"" is getting talked about a lot lately. Many people have different opinions about the face. If you aren't familiar with the ""face on mars"" then you're probably wondering why there is an argument going around. You're probably wondering this exact question: ""Why is there a big argument about ""The Face On Mars?"" The folllowing details and information will be informing you exactly why scientists and theorists are having different opinions about the peculiar face.

Some scientists are saying that the face up on the moon was not created by aliens because of all the research they have done with and about it. One example that tells you why it isnt an alien artifact is the shadows. The only way the messa (face on the moon) was able to have facial features was because of the shadows that was cascading down upon it. The shadows gave an illusion of eyes, a nose, and also a mouth.

Another example, would be the pictures that the scientists have taken. The first picture that was taken was taken on a cloudy day. The picture was to blurry to be able to make out any details. In 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took another picture that was ten times sharper than the first. One of the cameras they had contributed greatly to the search, since that camera was so sharp they would have easily been able to find any markings from extraterrestrial beings.

Also another detail helping the scientists was the weather. The weather took a massive part in this study. Since it wasn't a clear day at all and there were ""wispy clouds"", like in paragragh eight, the MOC team could not get a clear picture. When the team comes back to take yet another picture it is a clear day and with that clear day they are able to pick out any details from the ""artifact"" if there are any to pick out.

A final example, is how they compared the face to a formation on Earth. The scientists compared the face to the Snake River Plain of Idaho because of how similar they are. They are similar in a way because of the isolated messa, height, and landforms.

Theorists are saying the exact oppsoite from the researchers. Here is an example fo why they thought it was a true artifact. A few scientists themselves thought that is wasn't just a landform but something more. Since the scientists believed many people instantly believed too. They didn't think about the research that was done, but they chose to believe the few scientists.

An example that would support the idea of them believing, is that there were many movies made about the face. Many people believe everything they hear and what they see on T.V.

A final example is, how the skeptics thought it was created. ""If the aliens didn't create it then how did it form?"" That question was most likely going through their mind, trying to figure out if they should believe science and research or they should believe movies and others.

Yes, i understand how skeptics actually believe that the face was made by aliens because they dont know how it was created. They don't know who created it either. Scientists are proving that it was weather that created the formation and maybe even astroides. Theorists may also thinking that the haze prevented the scientists from seeing the alien's markings. If weather and haze prevented that then why didn't the scienists see the markings on the next photo that they took. That photo was even ten times shaprer.

The examples I have lsited help inform you why there is an argument going on about the face. Science clears and explains a lot more phenonmon than opinions and belifes do.    ",4,1,0.8590693473815918
40daf82,"I think that if we ever did find aliens on Mars or even a civilazation we should stay away from it. The reason why is because if we ever did find a other planet we never really be called the only planet in the universe. In the article we found out that we have a new way to find people. We never really thought that their was ever a civilazation on Mars.

As we found out that we may have found a way to a other civilazation. I just recently told you that we should never go near Mars. The reason why I told you that is because we don't now their lifes, their ways, or even if they were freindly. When NASA told us that we have a way to find people we should never talk to them. Yes it does show that we had images of planet Mars or even that their might have been a culture.

I have said that we should never really go to planet Mars because if we did we would be the only planet in the universe. This article was very interesting, but I think we should never go near Mars. ",1,1,0.5589087605476379
40e315e,"First off , In my opinion I think that there is no face on the moon. Some of NASA believe that some aliens made the face on the moon years ago. I believe that there is no face and that is beacuse there are no aliens. If there is a face on the moon it was probably made by an astroid or a meteorid that crashed there a few years ago and it was just now starting to form more into a face. If it were aliens who created the face on the moon, why didn't they come back time after time so the humans could see them. Honestly, who is there to blame for this mysterious face on the moon? Many people may ask, what should we do to figure out if there is a face or not. Well in my opinion, I think we should have NASA send someone or some people to the moon and see whats really going on. NASA also doesn't have evidence that there are aliens that did it. They just assume that there are aliens basically. Maybe there is really no face on the moon. I really think that maybe NASA should either just let this go or they should just send someone to space to chck it out. I just don't like how NASA has no evidence that there are asliens who made the face. I think maybe NASA should just go check it out for themselves.

Second, 25 years ago when Viking 1 snapped a photo of the face on the moon, it didn't really look all that good. Even when they took the photo from 1998 and 2001 the pictures still didn't look as nice as they should. People could always just snap a picture and rearrange things in the photo and then make it seem like there is an object there when there really isn't anything there. In the paragraph it even say's ""new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NAA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" That could possibly mean that when they were looking at photos they could have saw something else but rearranged the photo to see another thing that they didn't see but they wanted the world to belive them that a face wa on the moon. That is my opinion on if there is a face on the moon.",3,1,0.6756290793418884
410ef58,"You may think that the landform that resembles a human face is proof that there is alien life on Mars, but it actually does not prove anything. There are many reasons that the mesa could be there, and alien life is the least likely. Mesas are common around the area that the face was found, and recent pictures have proved that it is just a landform. Even taking the picture on a cloudless, sunny day proved nothing. It is simply a landform, and nothing more.

You might argue that it is unlikely that the landform is a mesa because it isn't natural, or that it looks unnatural. While it does look unnatrual, they are actually very common around the area that the face was found. Saying that it can't be a mesa because mesas aren't common simply isn't true. Cydonia has many mesas, the face included. There are plenty of mountains on Earth, and we all know that those aren't man-made. No one talks about one certain mountain that is man-made, while the rest aren't. Why should Mars be any different? They are all natural landforms, there isn't one that's just man made.

You may also argue that the first picture was taken on a day that was cloudy, or that the picture was unclear. You would be correct, which is why NASA went back eighteen years later and took the photo again on a cloudless, clear and sunny day. The picture was taken in summer, which is generally pretty cloudless in Mars. There was practically nothing that might obstruct the view of the ""face"", and what did we find? Nothing. We found a landform, just like we had found eighteen years earlier. There was nothing to obstruct the view. That means that when we did look and find nothing, that there was nothing there.

You still might not be convinced. You might say that we simply weren't close enough to find any strange alien markings, or that camera's quality wasn't good enough to see any of the strange alien markings, but that would also be correct. We took a picture of the mysterious ""face"" three times. Once in 1976, once in 1998, and finaly in 2001. Each time the picture was taken, the camera's quality was better. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters in the 1976 photo. With the image being that detailed, we would have been able to spot things as small as shacks next to the mysterious ""face"". We didn't, however. We found nothing except for the landmark, which proves that it is nothing more than an unusual landmark.

In conclusion, there is countless proof that the ""face"" on Mars is nothing more than an unusal mesa. Mesas are common in Cydonia, which is where the landmark was spotted. We have taken three photos, the quality better with each, and each time nothing other than the landmark was spotted. We even went back to take the photo on a cloudless, clear and sunny day with our best camera yet, and we still found nothing. That is all the proof that I need, and it's all the proof you need. There is nothing on Mars other than an unusual landmark, that happens to look like a face. ",5,1,0.8333907127380371
4145491,"Over the course of time, NASA has developed the technology that is capable of taking pictures of landforms found on other planets. Recently, NASA unveiled an image of a landform on Mars that looks like a human face. Some people believe that it a real face of an alien and make conspiracy theories about the face and spread it throughout the public. Even though that the ""face on Mars"" is just a rock landform shaped like a human face.

Firstly, humans would not be able to survive on Mars. The gases and lack of oxygen would kill them. The reality is that the picture is an actual human or alien face is just made up by conspiracy theorists . NASA has revealed this to the public so that they could some attention to mars.""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars (3).They just wanted conspiracy theorist to make people think that there was some sort of ancient civilization on Mars or some kind of aliens. Which was proven not to exist.

After NASA getting all attention on Mars from the ""Face on Mars"" debate, they went back upto space to see if they could capture more photos. NASA was using high-tech cameras to prove their theory of seeing a human face. ""MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when then image first appeared on JPL website, revealing... a natrual landform(7)."" The face is just a landform not an alien monument nor a human face.

Later on, after taking the pictures of the proven landform on Mars, the topic started to quite down. Some conspiracy theorist still spread their theories to the public. This is all how NASA researches foreign landforms on other planets. They take their camera satillites and capture a picture of the landform and continue to study it. NASA uses the knowledge they have about Earth to study the landforms on other planets. ""It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, say Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes place from an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12)."" The process just starts all over again.

After looking at all the scientific knowlege, you can conclude that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform. NASA does this so that they can get public attention about their research, until the theory is proven wrong. It is just like any other buisness that wants publicity. Aliens are currently proven to not exist, so most people like to try to change that theory whenever they find a small peice,of what could be eveidence. Even though it is proven to be a landmass.",4,1,0.8751730918884277
4151723,"The Face is a natural landform not a structure created by aliens because scientists have confirmed it. Many people still don't belive it's a natural landform. I have the following three reasons why I know that the Face is a natural landform. Reason one: the Martian mesa is a common landform around Cydonia. Second reason: after the picture was uploaded to the JPL web site they confirmed it was a natural landform. Last reason: what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms.

First reason: the Martian mesa is a common landform around Cydonia. As it says in paragraph two "" The face appeared on their monitors but the sensation was short lived."" Also on paragraph wo it says "" Scientists figured it was just another Mrtian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" Cydonia is a red planet with an abundant amount of Martian mesa's.

That's why i know the face is just a Martian mesa but confusing enough to be taken as an act that aliens might of done.

Second reason: after the picture was uploaded to the JPL web site they confirmed it was a natural landform. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia the people waited anxiously to see if it was alien made or a natural landform. On paragraph seven it says "" Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" On April 5, 1998 it was confirmed that the face was just a natural landform not an alien monument as people thought.

Last reason: what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. On paragraph twelve it says "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the America west."" It also says on paragraph twelve "" It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" For those reasons I know that the face is a natural landform.

The face is a natural landform not an alien structure because scientists confirmed it. I know this for the three following reasons. Reason one: the Martian mesa is a common landform in Cydonia. Reason two: after the picture was uploaded to the JPL web site it was confirmed it was a landform. Third reasom: what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms.

415a9a2,"Is ""The Face on Mars"" created by aliens or humans? This topic can be very debatable depending on an individual's sate of mind. It may be seen as a natural landform or believed that it was created purposely. Some may even say it was the aliens who created it, while others may disagree. In all, this topic should be about looking at the facts than a matter of opinions. The Face on Mars may seem as though it was created by aliens, while there's proof of it being a natural landform on Mars.

To begin with, the Face on Mars is a natural landform. It became a priority, or an important task, to get a picture as soon as possible, to satisfy everyone's beliefs. On April 5, 1998, a NASA team, finally got a picture of it, 10 times sharper than the original showing there was no alien monument after all. To prove it once again, the NASA team captured another picture on April 1, 2001. The photo that was taken, was said to use the best quality, to show any mysterious unkowns. The Face on Mars wasn't equivalent to the name at all, it officially became an ordinary landform as such on Earth.

As continued, some will sate that it is an alien monument. There have been disagreements, even by scientist, believing it was an alien artifact. When first discovered, it seemed as though it was an Egyptian Pharoah. When photographs were taken, some argued that it was due to it being winter on Mars that the alien monument was missed, but as seen in the photographs, that is not proven to be the reason. The most recent picture was one taken to officially declare that there was no alien monument, using the camera's maximum resolution, which were used to show any objects surrounding it. As seen in the most recent phototgraph, it's equivalent to what a butte or mesa would look like.

In conlusion, ""The Face on Mars"" is a topic that can be seen with two sides. Depending on a person's beliefs or their state of mind, one may think differently. When looking at the facts, it is shown that it was mistaken to be an alien artifact when it really was just a natural landform. NASA's teams have been working on a way to prove it, taking massive amounts of time to get the right photographs revealing something equivalent to a butte or messa, but there will always be some who disagree. Some may say that it was NASA's fault for not showing the ""real"" unkown and hiding it to themselves, and taking it at the wrong time. ""The Face on Mars"" is well believed to be known as an alien artifact or an ordinary landform, causing many disputes to a person's beliefs and opinions. ",4,1,0.9259217381477356
4180c40,"The Face, confusing and causing many arguements with others asking if it is a form of alien life, or just a natural landform. Many conspiracy theorists believe it to be an image of civilization of Mars. NASA, on the other hand believes it to be a natural landform. The Face is most likely a natural landform because of the formation, similarities with other landforms, and common sense.

The Face 's formation helps prove that it is a natural landform. A few days after the new photo of the face, NASA unveiled the photo with a caption reading,"" a huge rock formation. . . which resembles a human head. . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This interpretation helped show that the Face was possibly a natural landform.

The similarities with other landforms also helps prove that it is a natural landform. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Garvin is saying that it is very similar to another natural landfrom which would support the evidence that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

The last distinct things that proves the Face on Mars is a natural landform is common sense. Many conspiracy theorists state that it is a sign of new life, but is that really what it is. In April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of conspiracy theorists, and web surfers were eagerly waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. This proves that common sense can play a keen role in porving that the Face is a natural landform.

The Face has been puzzling many people and causingarguements over these past years. The Face is one of the hardest problems to debunk, whether you are a scientist, or an average person just wanting to figure out the problem. But after close examination from many people, it shows that the Face is a natural landform. The Face is a natural landform because of its formation, its evidence, and common sense.

We have these landforms on our very own planet, so its understandable as to how we can recognize one on another planet.

On top of that, we used top quality equipment to study and research the Face on Mars. This is backed up by how in the article it says, ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the space craft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,' said Gavin. 'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'

41cfc2c,"The so called ""Face"" on Mars brought an abundance of attention to NASA and the planet Mars. Everything from magazines, books, and a movie talked about how the Face was created by aliens. The Face was not created by aliens, but is a natural landform found on Mars.

The Face was reveald from a photo taken by Viking 1 in 1976. The photo taken looked like a face because the cameras where not as advance has they are today. The photo was taken with a resolution with 43 meters per pixel leaving out many details that could not be captured, therefore making the landform appear as if it were a face. When NASA took a seccond photo with a camera that had a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel in the exact same location as the first photo was taken the image looked nothing like a face because it captured many more details than the first this show the distortion of the first caused it to look like a face. Also when the seccond photo was taken it was a clear day and there was not any clouds unlike the first photo which means it could not have been affected at all. Unlike the seccond image the first had clouds which could draken or lighten the image in certain places to give details that make it look like a face are not actually there on the landform.

In conclusion, the so called ""Face"" on Mars is nothing but a landform on the planet. It was not created by aliens, but the planet it self. It just happend to resemble a face because of poor resolution and clouds in the atmoshere.   ",3,1,0.8662447929382324

We made this conclusion when we first snapped a picture 10x faster of the face, we also took a second look and picture, and it has simalarites like a natural landform from the Snake River Plain of Idaho on Earth. But, there are people that think our conclusion to this is a conspiracy theory.

In 1998 on April 5, for the first time, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. A picture was captured 10x better than the orginal viking photos. they were later posted on a website for the public to see but for the people who thought it was a sign of life on Mars, they were wrong. Scientist's said it was just a natural landform.

For the second time, the scientist could yet again reach Cydonia once again to turn their conspiracy theory to fact. Others back on Earth said it was too windy and it made the clouds affect the picture. This time researchers used a maximum resolution camera to prove the theorists wrong. Yet again Garvin said, "" If there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were.""

Scientist said that the ""face"" was equivalent to a butte or mesa. They made this staement because there is something similar to it on Earth in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These are found around the American West. Garvin said, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the ""Face on Mars.""

On the other side of things, there were many conspiracy theorists that questioned NASA's claim. Everyone wasn't satisfied with the pictures that were first taken people said it was during a cloudy season, that's why there was another trip with more advanced equipment. They also stated that the camera on board had to go through the clouds and dust to see the face so the picture couldn't been shown clearly. Another claim they made is that since there were wispy clouds the alien markings could be hidden in the haze and scientists just didn't look hard enough.

In conclusion we have the facts that we need to prove that "" The Face"" is just a natural landform. We have provided the public with two pictures. Plus we also made observations that it looked like a landform from here on Earth. As NASA, we would like to see the conspiracy theorists prove us wrong then they could state the facts for once.                   ",4,1,0.8958591222763062

I would then find some facts on maybe how the face image could have been created . I would state logical reasoning fatcs .

I

would then

state this image is a natural landform , many things in space could have formed this image .

an illusion like how the passage states that the author says ,'' it reminds me most of the middle butte in the snake river plain of Idaho .'' thats saying it is basically not a conspiracy related image because something on earth is created or formed by natural effects .

Many people like to make theories about subjects but nobody knows about the real information. Not unless we share it to the public, we will not share things we want to hide from everyone. The picture was not made by aliens and we explain why it is just a natural landform.

If I were to be a scientist at NASA I would tell the person that the Face is just a natural landform. There are many conspiracy theorists that claim we are trying to hide something, such as saying aliens made the Face. In the article it says

"" evidence that NASA would rather hide "" , that is correct. If the aliens did make it then we wouldn't have showed the public the photos. We would want to keep it out of newspapers, magazine, tv shows, and movies.

NASA would also never want lots of people to see the picture of the Face if they were to hid something. We would make the picture an enigma to the citizens of the world. Scientist in NASA have studied these for years and they have all the information. Also in the third paragraph in the article it tells us that there are some shadows that make the the Face get the illusion of having eyes and a nose. The third paragraph says "" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. "" which is telling us that they want people to know more about Mars so we obvisouly wouldn't be showing the pictures if the aliens made it.

Although there were few scientist that believed the Face was an alien artifact, in paragraph seven it says

"" ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. "" , NASA scientist take their jobs very serious. People continued to say the Face markings were made from aliens but the NASA scientist said it was just a natural landform and some of the pictures were made from the shadows. On April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer in Cydonia, Malin's team got an "" extraordinary "" picture of the Face because many people such as the theorists said maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.

In the second paragraph NASA was excited to see if the Face was something sensational and the article says "" Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. "" the only thing that made this one stand out was it has shadows that give it facial features such as a nose, eyes and a mouth. NASA soon showed the picture for all the people to see with a caption telling them what it was. NASA would not show the picture and make up something if the Face was really created by aliens.

Paragraph twelve says "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. "".

When taking pictures of possible landing spots for the Viking 2, it picked up a shadowy figure that resembled a human head. But, scientists just figured it was another Martian Mesa which was common on Cydonia.

There is no life on Mars because the Face is actully just a Mesa. Mesas can be found on earth also, for example in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is the Middle Butte. The Middle Butte is quite equivalent to the Face on Mars. The formation of the mesa has caused shadows to make it resemble a human face. These mesas are common on Cydonia.

Conspiracy theorists believed that NASA is trying to hide the fact that there is life on Mars. The reality is that NASA would in fact benefit from currently, or once having life on Mars. There was no actual alien monument which was later discovered after having the pictures enhanced, when enhanced there would have been other alien monuments around it. The pictures taken only showed that it was just a Martian mesa. Not a monument created by aliens, but a mesa that is found on any other planet. Thus, further backing the fact there is no alien life on mars.",3,1,0.8457334041595459

After reavealing. . . a natural landfrm, there was no alien monument after all. Another reason why I know it's just a land form because, when NASA actually gets a sceond look at the picture, it actually shows it is equivalent to a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Garvin said it reminded him from the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The shadows gave the the illusion of the eyes nose, and mouth. so, it wasnt really facial features it just was the shadows making it seem like it.

Eyes, nose mouth it looks like a face no doubt about it, but it cannot be stuctured by living substances. Most scientists have been saying that this face was made by aliens, but I have to disagree. It just simply can not.

I belive that the face on mars is just a natural landform because we do not even know if aliens exist in the first place. There is no prove that aliens exist so why are we jumping into the conclusion, assuming that aliens made this landform. Prove to me aliens exist then we can start thinking if they had anything to do with this. If not then I do not even think that aliens should be in this conversation. Also even If aliens made this landform that looks like a face, how can they make it like that. It is kind of a perfect face, and I belive that you need some technology to build a structure like that. I don't know how they could do all that by hand. Another topic about this landface I want to point out is the three photos. Have you not have noticed how the face changed every couple of years? Well I do. It makes me belive that nature has built that landface throughout the years withe the wind and rain and the planet shaking at times. There is basically no evidence that aliens have built this landface.

Well If you still do not belive me and still think aliens have built this landface than I think you are insane because I gave you a bunch of reasons why there is no way and there is no evidence that aliens have built this landface.

25 years ago NASA says they found the face on Mars. While they were circleing mars with their space drone. It was a short lived suprised because it looked like a natual structure that formed over time. Then a couple days later NASA let the whole world see, if NASA even had the littlest idea that aliens then they would not have released it to the public. The face has become a pop icon that everyone likes. Some thimk that this is pure evidence of life on Mars but NASA's budget defenders wish there was because if there was life on mars then they would get tons of money from the discovery of extraterestrial beings on mars. Overall the face is decaying over the years if there was aliens then don't you think they would fix it at least maybe once or twice over the many years that ""their creation"" that proves that ali nes didnt make it. You can also compare it to narurally made landforms that are common around the western part of America. So if there were thnings that were made but non natural then they would be able t o see all the falts andpices you can tell that were not naturally made,because of how good the graphics are on the space drones phtos that are tooken in such great quality that you can see all the pixles. This creation really stood out to NASA because they can only see in 2.5km strips amd is mostly made out of Mars dust that surrounds Mars,they had to peer through the wispy clouds just to see it because of how cloudy it is on that side of the planet. Therefor it proves that these are natural land forms because there are things that on earth that may look like this.

In conclusion I think that the face on Mars was naturally made for alot of valid reasons . At the end of the day we might not ever know what made the face on Mars, we can only have our thoughts and oppiouns on Who or What made the structure. ",3,1,0.8772372603416443

The Face that was found on Mars, was not created by aliens, it is a natural landorm. It's a natural landofrm becuase, scientists studied it, it is popuar, and there are pictures. Some may not believe that this is a natural landform. But, there is some information to make you want to believe it.

Stuides by scientists have shown that this Face is not just like any other. It was not created by aliens, and it is not normal. In the text it says,''Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.'' This describes how unusual this Face looked. There is no way that this Face was created by aliens. It is far more detailed that what aliens could have done.

The Face that was found on Mars, was very popular. The uniqueness of the Face made it stand out more to others. In the passage it says,'' It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lanes for 25 years!'' This tells the reader how the Face on Mars was important to most people. The Face on Mars was to be known all over the world.

Scientists took pictures of the Face on Mars. The pictures let you know what they look like and it gives you an idea of what they are describing. In the text it says,''Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.''

There was trial and error problems with the pictures. In the text it says,''The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.''

In 2001 they took another picture, and this one was more clearer that the one taken in 1976. The text also says,'' Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's aboslute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 neters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Some apponents may say that the Face on Mars was made by aliens. Maybe they have a point. In the text it says,'' Some people think the Fcae is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-eveidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.'' But, the photos that were taken make it clear that there is no way the unusual Face was made by aliens. In the text it says,''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

As the years go on, people may still wonder how the Face on Mars was made. Some may still think that the aliens did it. Others might never get to know the real answer.

Some say that the Face reminds them of something on Earth. Thus, this must mean that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.                             ",5,1,0.8851664066314697

The Face is a plain old mesa. The reason it looks like a face is because of unusal shadows. Then NASA used a high resoultion camera and saw it was just a landformation. Also Cydonia is an area with mesas.

They have multiple pictures of the Face. They releasaed them to the public saying it was a landformation. If it wasn't they wouldn't have told the public. Also in the pictures you can see that it's not a face.

Others say that the Face was made by aliens. They say that the photos weren't clear enough and that NASA is trying to hide the ancient alien civiliazation. However, they took much more clear photos . Also if there was an ancient alien civilization NASA would be happy and would tell the world because it would benefit them.

430d4de,"Why does NASA consider the ""Face of Mars"" to be a natural landform? They claim that the ""face"" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim.

Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed ""haze"" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found.

In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called ""alien face."" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the ""alien face"" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding.

On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure ""resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face.

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect.",4,1,0.787944495677948

The pictures of the giant 2-mile long face taken on Mars sparked a lot of attention.

Especially conspiracy theorists.

Causing all kinds of accusations against NASA and if the face found on Mars was alien or not.

There are plenty of reasons why this land formation is natural. Such as, the image, taken plenty of times, revealed no alien artifacts or marking that would seem unusual to NASA's Mars Global Survey team.

The land form is called a mesa, which is found commonly in the American West.

Also, saying that NASA is hiding the real alien information would make no sense, it could benefit them exponentially.

The landform, when first captured on photo, triggered skeptics. Saying the image should be retaken due to the low quality. When retaken, they were, of course, not satisfied. When the final image was taken, it revealed no artifacts. A disappointment to not only those conspiracy theorists, but to NASA too.

The name of the landform, was uncommonly known, as a mesa.

A mesa is a naturally occuring landform that resembles the characeristics of a face. They form from collapsed lava domes or my the simple means of erosion. They are commonly found in the American West. One famous one that resembles the Face on Mars, as said by Jim Garvin, chief scientist on the Mars Exploration Program, is Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is an odditiy to see.

When faced with all the vidence, people began questioning if NASA was hiding the evidence. NASA has made clear that they did not hide anything. NASA supporters have also brought up the simple fact that proving alien life is real could benefit NASA. They would have no reason to hide it and the government could not benefit from hiding this information either. The discovery could get them funding for future expeditions and further discoveries.

The evidence is plain and simple. Alien life on Mars is not there. WHIle many still believe and argue more. The famous face is a landform, discovered through muliple images and NASA has said they have no reason to hide anything from the public. We have the right to know everything.",4,1,0.8421019315719604
433d0c2,"The land form found on mars was most surrley created by natural land. It states in paragraph 3 it says ""huge rock formation...wich resembles a human head...formed by shadows."" It was an illusion created by the shadows wich make it look like thers all the fetures of a human head. But some people disagree and think that was aleins that made the head, but they didnt have claims or evedence that aliens are the ones who did it.

In paragraph 5 it says that the ""Face on Mars"" has since became a popular icon. It also states that some people think that it is boneified evedince of life on mars, but how can the bones or remains of these so called ""Aliens"" have suvived all those years it would have deteriated away by now.

A few scientists think that is was created by alein. Even know in the begining of the artical it talked about how it was just a shadowy illusion that made you think that is was human head. But now there saying that it might of acuttaly been created by aleins.

The scienstists are right because in the artical it rarely has evedence of aleins being the ones who caused this. Also the scientis have all the evedence and claims and facyts to clariffy that aleins didnt do it. It was just natural causes and illusions.                 ",2,1,0.8303380608558655
438648b,"Some people say that ""The Face on Mars"" is something that was built by ancient aliens, much like the theories that people come up with about the structures on Earth. Some people have even stated that the ""aliens"" could be trying to cover it up by hiding it during the time they take it. Then there are the firm believers that this is just a land mass that consists of the surroundings and resembles a mesa type biome. Since there have been developments over time, showing the different variations of the ""face"" and what it has become over the years. There are different arguements and different points of view, but there are different time periods with different variations of the same thing, so it will be proven that is is a natural land mass, and not a martian made structure.

There is a lot of things that points toward this being a natural land mass and that it is not a Martian made structure, or that the Government is trying to cover it up. One thing that shows that it is a natural structure is when the article states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia..."" This means that there are multiple things like this, but the only things that make this one different is the fact that is has ""unusual shadows"" in it that make it look human or like a structure that was built. After this happened and people got news of it and figured out it wasn't real, the Conspiracy Theorists came out and made it seem like a cover up, but this isn't true, because NASA could have gotten publicity from it, as well as many funds. This mesa is no different from anything that we have in Western United States, there we have many mesas that could look equally as strange, but we don't bother, because we want to believe that there is other life, or that there is something strange going on in other planets.

Over the years, the images of this land mass have gotten more and more clear, and we have come to realize, that no, it is not a face, but it is a large point with shadowy parts in it. From the picture from 1976, it is really blurry, and you can't really tell what it is, which is what got people hopes up and thought it may be a structure, due to the shadows and the formation around it. The 1998 one is a bit clearer, but it still is a bit unclear of what it is or could be, because it does look like it could be something like the Sphinx in Egypt, but with the same formation around it. The 2001 image looks way more clear, and this one shows something completely different than what we expected, it is just a regular mesa, with cracks, dips and shadows, and the same formation around it as before. There is something you can tell about the 2001 picture though, if you look closely, it is the same image as all the others, because you can see the dips in it where the ""eyes"" and ""mouth"" are, just more clear so they don't really show up, and since everything is more clear, you can see the cracks, which could have added to the effect.

Even after all of the theories that were made, and NASA defending themselves, as well as people trying to prove them wrong, and prove that there was something that the government did to cover it up. All of this could still be fought, who knows, there could be life out there somewhere besides on Earth, but as of now, there is no proof, and this image will still remain a natural land structure. Some people are dissapointed by this, others are motivated to keep moving and possibly one day find some signs of life, so maybe humans would be prepped and set in case of disaster. There is nothing wrong with personal opinions, but for the most part and from what pictures and plenty of evidence have proven, this is still no more than a natural occurence do to the way land forms over time. So even though people may keep looking for any signs of something that could be a conspiracy, or you just want to find something ""supernatural"" or strange, but the fact stands that there are many thing like this, and just because it is on a different planet, does not make it anymore special, and it doesn't make it any different.",5,1,0.8754851222038269
43a5fd6,"There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens. There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform. Either way, do we really know what it is?

The face is a very mysterious thing. It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet. There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also they might not belive in aliens.

There are also people who think aliens created it. They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face. So they start to think what could have created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.

People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet. It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face. Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.

On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform. People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy. But on April 8, 2001 he set out for another picture. They took an extrodinary picture. Again it proved it was just a landform. So therefore the people who thought it was just a landform were correct.

In conclusion people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landorm because of a picture? Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.   ",3,1,0.8428910970687866
43d40a3,"""The Face''

As we all know in the year of 1976 Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo which was belived to be a ""face'' formed in Mar's surface. There has also been arguments over the years if ""the face"" was created by aliens or was it just a natural landform. Here is why I belive it is a natural landform.

In the article ""Umasking the Face on Mars, in paragraph 12 it says what the picture that the picture actually shows that the Martian is equaivalent to a butte or messa which are landforms common around the American West. Some migfht that you can't actually tell what things really are just from a picture because it is only a proportion. Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.

Some might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.

In conclusion, I belive that ""The Face"" was a just a natural landform. I belive this because of the eveidence that NASA provided and the fact that they went back to space and took anthor picture with up to date technology.",4,1,0.8574632406234741
43dea20,"The face is just a natural landform and it couldnt have been made by aliens for certain reasons and here is why. There were no living creatures to be found anywhere on mars. Even in the last paragraph it said it reminded Garvin of most of

Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars."" Garvin also said about the Face. Natural landforms are usually formed by Natural events. Probably the same thing that happened on Mars. When Mars Gloval Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it snaped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking pictures and all it revealed was a natural landform, no alien monument. Although some said that the alien markings might have been hidden by haze, there still was no alien markings to be found after the next picture they took on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. It was the best 1976 Viking photo and still no sightings of life on Mars.

I do too think there might be forms of life or ""aliens"" on other planets but just maybe not Mars. After all, Mars is not completly suitiable for life to live on even though its called Earths twin. If we just do enough research, soon we just might find more interesting things to lead us to other forms of life on other planets.   ",3,1,0.8986498117446899
440261d,"In this essay I will be giving an argument on why this so called ""face"" is not made by aliens.

The prompt tells you that one of your colleagues says that it is created by aliens.

My job in this essay is to tell why it isn't and give an explanation.

The figure that NASA saw was a so called ""face on mars"".

They claimed that it was in the shape of a human head and it was thought to be made by aliens.

In my oppinion this is not made by aliens.

Here is a reason why.

All these years NASA has gone to a two or three planets looking for aliens.

Throughout the years how many have we found, none!

Yes, we may have found some traces of aliens, but we can not prove that these are actually alien tracks, or alien lifeforms.

There is no way to prove that this structure was made by aliens, unless we have images of them, and so far we have none.

Look down on earth.

How many mesas or Buttes do we have in America, or even around the world?

Now think about this, were these man made?

No, none of these land formations were man made!

They are formed naturally by nature.

Now over the years we have found a lot of reasons how Mars is sort of like the earth.

It carries water, and it is one of the easiest planets to get to, so if you think about it, Mars could have the same land formations as we do!

Nature is a beautiful thing, and it more than likely made this so called ""face"".

Yes, you may be right in some way.

Yes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.

This COULD have been made by aliens.

Maybe they are trying to connect to other life outside of their planet.

That is the only argument that you have against me.

The argument that isn't even factual.

You are going off of a guess in your mind.

So overall in this essay I have covered three thing.

I have covered my first argument, which is that we have not found aliens even though we have been searching all of these years.

I have covered my second argument, which is that nature has formed many structures like this on earth, it could have been formed out of the land.

And I also covered the rebuttle, which is that there is a possibility that this was built by aliens because we have found traces.

So in conclusion, this structure was not built by humans, this was land made. ",3,1,0.8307855129241943
4408754,"There have been conspiracy theories going around that the Face on Mars is actually created by aliens, but it can be proven to everyone that the claims are false. The Face is simply a natural landform, and NASA is not trying to hide or distort the truth. Some may still be skeptical, but there is proof that the Face is not an alien monument of any sort.

As stated before, the Face is actually a natural landform. It's the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa found commonly in the American West. Fellow researcher, Jim Garvin, even states that it reminds him of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho""(paragraph 12). It can be proven that Earth landforms definitely aren't made from aliens, and the same could be said for the Face.

The Face isn't even an actual face, so it's unlikely it even is an alien monument. The only reason the rock formation resembles a face is because the shadows cast an illusion of facial features such as eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Pictures of the Face were captured two other times using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Skeptics may believe that NASA messed up somewhere or that something was flawed, but it is highly unlikey that this is true. The procedure was performed on a cloudless summer day with the best camera at NASA's disposal.

Some skeptics may still doubt that the Face wasn't created by aliens, believing that NASA is just attempting to hide the evidence of an ancient civilization. In truth, this is false, but many defenders of the NASA budget wish there were signs of alien life. How can one believe NASA is keeping secrets about alien life from the public when it would benefit to do the opposite. Proof of an alien civilization would be more helpful to share than hiding it, so why do people believe otherwise?

Whether or not people believe the Face is actual just a Martian landform, it doesn't affect the researchers of NASA. Evidence to support the claim has been provided, but what proof do the skeptics have? Can they really disprove the truth or are they just desperate for attention?",4,1,0.9285391569137573

Forty years later, those consperacies remain in the minds of many people who do not belive NASA when they say, ""It's just a mesa."" NASA has sent three objects to Mars, the Viking 1 the Vinking 2, and a MGS, in which all three have been able to locate this face shaped messa in a area called Cydonia. Each time the face become a little less noticiable but stil noticable enough to find.

On April 5th, 1998, the MGS along with Michael Malin and his Mars Obriter Camera flew over Cydonia for the first time. They were albe to snap a picture ten times sharper than the one taken in 1976. The picture was uploaded to the internet, where thousands of wed surfers wher waiting to see what it revealed. to many their theory had been proven to be correct, while others still thought it was a alien built structure. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was satisfied with the outcome. Some skepticcs said that alien marking were hiden by the haze. The pictures were taken at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet, causing the Mars Global Surveyor to have to peer through wispy clouds in order to see the face.

The skeptics were right when they said that they had to peek through haze, however they were wrong about the part where they said the haze hid the alien markings. On April 8th, 2001, just three years after the Viking 2 found the face, another mission to Mars reached its location. the 8th of April was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The MGS was able to draw close enough for a second look at the face. Garvin said, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Fce in the feld of view.

He went on to say, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes in the groud or Egyptian-styl pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" By saying that, Garvin proved all those speculations about the face being an alien structer, are false.

What the picture actually shows, is not a alien civilation, but is the Martian equivalent od a butte or messa. Buttes and mesas are common landforms around the American West. Garvin addedthat it reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He then explained,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.""

After the first picture of the face on Mars was released to the public, NASA explained the picture is just, ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It was later added that it is just another Martian mesa,, common around Cydonia. The only difference that seperates this one form the rest are unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Like the man on the moon, the face on Mars is only a structure that resembals the humans that run Earth. The accidental resemblance is quite astonishing to say the least, thought nevertheless, in reality its ""just anouther Masa"" made by nature not aliens. ",4,1,0.8183372020721436
442da01,"Many people on Earth can argue that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact. Others can argue as well with the explaination of why the Face is not an alien artifact. In a way, there is no such evidence of this formation to be an exact subject of matter of an alien artifact. This is not bya any case true because there is no absolute evidence that there is an ancient civilization living on Mars, the Face is just a natural land form (and what is called a meas), and the pixles on camras have improved over the years than what scientists used twenty-five years ago.

In the case of a conspiricy therorist, they can give you some facts and ideas to support their idea of aliens and that they were the ones that created the Face, there is just not enough evidence to support their claim to that. There is not even a single drop of evidence that there is an ancient civilization living on Mars. In the text in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", it stated that few scientist belied that the Face was an alien artifact because the MGS was sent into Mars to take photos eighteen years later after the Viking missions ended.

There is still more reasons to say that the Face is not created by aliens because the Face is just a natural landform. Like here on Earth, there is many and many landforms. In the text, it said that when the MOC snapped a picture of the Face, it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- land forms that are common in the American West.

Even before when the space team took pictures of the Face, their technology was not as sophisticated as it was eighteen yearas later when they took another picture of the Face and reveling a Martian mesa. There is better technology with camaras

in 2001 then there was twenty-five years ago. In the article, it says that MGS flew over the first time, Michael Malin and his MOC teeam snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This indicated that the team had better equipted camaras than they had when the original photos were taken. Although, some conspiricy therorist might give off some logical information that ther could be a civilization, there is still no sign

nor any evidence that

gives off of aliens living on Mars and or even creating the Face.

Over all, in that case, there is still logical evidence and reasons why people must think over twice before concluding the idea of another civilization living in our solar system. Who knows? Maybe one

day there could be beings that we

would encounter someday.",4,1,0.835840106010437

My reason that the ""face"" discovered in Mars is fake because the area where the ""face"" was discovored (Cydonia) has stroms their a lot and snow. So, there is a possibility that it was huge landform and the weather wore off the the landform to the point where it was a face. About a month ago we have released the picture in a JPL web site, revealing that the ""face"" is just another landform.

As of right now we are trying to look at the ""face"" to look and conclude it is another Landform and not ""aliens"". we have also found that the landmass is the bottleneck of a volcano so maybe in a few years it will erupt and prove that it's not a face.

Yes, we have made history by taking one little picture that we can't even look at it. If you wanna look at the ""face"" just look up these coordinates. 41 degrees north martian latitude. maybe you will see it as a landform and not a face.

Wether people think that aliens created the faces, NASA is trying to figure out what is creating this face. Is it alien life form, is it the changes of the planet. We may never know until we arive on Mars in human presents.

Why do people beleive what others say, beleive what you think its is. scientests beleive that aliens on Mars that created the man. Why do you think so Scientest? Do you all beleive in everything you come up with. The man on mars could be where a meteore hit and it was froze over.

447ba4f,"In 1976 NASA scientists took a picture of a landform on Mars. Many people thought it looked like a human face. Some other people knew that it was just a landform that was common on Mars. I am here to tell you that is was just a natural landform. NASA has evidence that will backup this statement. In the following paragraphs I will tell you about the evidence, the camera technology, and how the media affected the responds of people.

Many people will argue that the mesa on Mars is a face. Although it may look like a face, it isn't. In paragraph 1 it says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia..."" This quote tells us that the scientists were used to seeing these large landforms around the region. NASA wouldn't release these images if they thought aliens were involved. The object you see in the picture is simply a landform with shadows in just the right spot.

Back in 1976, the camera technology wasn't great. Many of the cameras had large pixles that made the pictures blury. In paragraph 10 it says, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This quote proves that the camera technology has improved greatly. Some conspiracy theorists aruge that even though the picture was not at high resolution, you can still see a face. This may be true,but you can also clearly see the shadows that made it look like a face.

The media had a significant impact on the Mars event. In paragraph 5 it says, ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows...and grocery store checkout lanes for 25 years."" This shows that the media has made people believe that there is a face on Mars.

After going back and taking a picture of the face years after the original photo was taken, you can no longer see the face. In paragraph 10 it says, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" This goes onto prove that NASA was right the whole time about the ""Face"" on Mars. This statement also shows that NASA was working on this mystery too.

After looking at all the evidence and photos you can clearly see that the ""Face"" on Mars is just a landform. If you think there is life on Mars, think again. The face has entertained many people for years, so it is nice to finally put this mystery behind us.",4,1,0.8883546590805054
44a1d3c,"Did you know that Mars has a natural landform that looks like a face?The Face that is on Mars is just a landform because it has changed over the years,NASA captioned it a ""huge rock formation"", and many scientists have studied the landform.

First,The Face that is on Mars is just a natural landform because over the years NASA has been taking pictures of the Face and the more pictures that NASA took the Face did not look like a Face anymore, it looked like a natural landform that was on Mars.

Next, many scientists who saw the Martian Face that is on Mars,figured that it was just a Martian mesa that resembled a human head which was formed by shadows giving the illusion of the human eyes, nose, and mouth. Authors reasoned that the image would be a good way to engage the public to attract their attention towards them knowing more about Mars.

Finally, a few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact and sent the Mars Global Surveyor to the Red Planet. When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter team got many photos which were sharper than the original Viking photos. The images were soon on a JPL website where the thousand of web surfers saw the image which revealed that it was just a natural landform.

In conclusion, The face that is on Mars is just a landform because it has changed over the years, NASA has captioned it a ""huge rock formation"", and many scientists have studied the landform. Also now that people know the Face is not a face at all, but just a landform that NASA studied and analyzed many times will help the people know that they should wait and to not believe someone who has not seen it.",3,1,0.9117124080657959
44bca10,"The face on Mars really is just a landform. I've seen the landform before on our very own home planet. My family and I were going to Grand Canyon for a vacation. Life had been rough so we decided we deserved to see the country a little bit. Upon arriving in Arizona, I saw hundreds of mesas, which are landforms that look like faces. I was petrified at first, until I learned they were merely landforms. The first time I saw the alledged ""Face on Mars,"" I knew it was merely a landform. I believe the Face is a landform and not an alien figure because it was exaggerated by Hollywood and the media, it would be better for NASA if it were an alien life form, and there are already lots of similar landforms on Earth.

Hollywood, its the home of the media. Of course the media will do anything for views. As soon as they found out about the Face, they jumped all over it. For instance, in paragraph 5, the author quotes, ""The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon."" This implies that it really wasn't a big deal before it started to become popularized. Paragraph 5 also shows us that it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in magazines, books, radio talk shows, and even was told in checkout lines for 25 years. The Face was an icon of its time, and thus was twisted to seem like an alien figure.

Moving on, why would NASA want to keep an alien a secret? If NASA actually did find an alien, they would want to let the world know so that they'd have more funding. In paragraph 5, we are told that the NASA budget wishes that there was an ancient civivlization of Mars. This proves that it would help NASA pay off debts and would make them more popular in the face of the public. It is also stated in paragraph 7 that Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, had a few words to say.

""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim said. This exemplifies that NASA knew it was only a landform, but they wanted to take pictures so that the public would pay them more.

A third reason for my believing is that there are already many landforms like this. The landform is called a mesa. As I said earlier, I've seen many of these landforms in Arizona. We are shown in paragraph 7 that when the picture of The face first appeared on a JPL web site, it showed that there was no alien monument, only a landform. This proves to us that sure, if you take a picture from a certain angle, it looks like a face; when you take it from a different angle, it looks like the landform that it is. This is similar to the Man on the Moon. We know that it is just a bunch of craters, making it look like a human figure. In the final section, 12, Garvin states a perfect example.

""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is an excerpt from the passage that demonstrates how the Face is no different from our landforms on Earth.

Some might say that the face is actually an alien monument, and that NASA just doesn't want the public to know. But, what they don't realize is that NASA would benefit from seeing an alien life form. The public would love it, and the money would start rolling in. The author tells us that defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars.

It seems that life gets so boring for people that they make any little thing seem amazing. This is shown through the fact that people made a landform appear as an alien monument. Through all the incomplete theories, I still believe that the Face is purely a landmark. I believe this because hollywood and the media exaggerated it greatly, the discovery of alien life would actually benefit NASA, and there are many landmarks on Earth and Mars that represent the supposed ""Face of Mars.""",6,1,0.8818620443344116
44cc40e,"Finding a rock-like formation on Mars was one of the biggest dicscovories NASA has made. They first say it in a picture taken by one of their satlights called Viking 1.

The shadows over the object looked made the formation look like a human face. Scientist called this formation on the red plant Cydonia. The scientist said that the face was about 2 miles long. When NASA announcded this to the public they called it a huge rock formation. Later NASA started making conspiracy theorist. When NASA took their second picture the public waited till they announcded the picture. Later some of the people got in a fights saying that it was a Natural landformation or it was created by aliens.

The face is just a rock formation. When the Viking 1 took the picture it said that the shadows made the formation look like a face. Scientist confermed it was a Mesa. They said that the martian mesa was common enough around Cydonia. The third picture provide it was not a face their was nothing similar. NASA's people who spend the money really wished it was a ancient civilization on Mars. They thougth that you could not see some parts of the mesa is because haze was blocking some of it. The last time scientist looked into this they looked at the seroundings and could not find anything.

NASA is afriad of saying there is an ancient civilization, they are makeing conspiracy theorist to cover it up. Over time the dust on Mars could of covered up the the alien artifact. When they took a picture they said it looked like and Egyption Pharaoh. The people who took the pictures could have changed it to make it look like nothing was there. People believe that the fas was covered by haze and so you could not see it. The picture they took could have been from another mesa because the scientist say that it is not easy to get a picture of this. They also said that they can not always take a picture with it because it circles Mars.

The rock formation was not man made it was a landform. The only thing different about these is that they remind people of the Snake river Plain in Idaho. If there was and civilization we would have found more then just one formation. Every thing around the mesa is normal there is nothing different. Scientists used different sights and took pictures and they all look like a rock formation. There could have been somthing covered but not in that area.",3,1,0.8565428256988525
44d5b69,"The face on mars was not made by aliens or anything else. The details from from the old camera made it look like a face because it was blurry. They told people about the face and showed to help make money for Nasa. it was made naturally from volcanoes and other things like sand storms. It would be impossible for aliens to do it from this distance and make it look that much like it from a bad camera.

The detail from the camera made it look that way because we didnt have the best technology back then than we do now. Also, each year we got better technology and it started to make it look less like a face each time. In the story before paragraph one it show pictures of each year they took a pic of it and it slowly became less of a face. Once we got better technology it made stuff much easier for us to see and tell if it was made or it was just a coincidence.

Next, nasa told everyone about there discover and that made a lot of new movies and magizines come out from it. they wanted money so in paragraph five they talk all about it and about how they wanted stuff to happen. People thought they were trying to hide somethings about aliens making the faces as proof. The people wanted know a lot about this and waited for the pictures to come up on a website and many was disappointed.

After, that face is made out of it sand and mostly rock from volcanos when they burst into flames and creates land forms. The wierd shadowing is comeing from all the sand around them and makes slight shadowing on the face to make it look like a face. it took many years for them to find something like this and then they realized it was just a landform. The only way for smoething like that to happen is by luck not aliens because aliens didnt do anything here or on mars. the sun was a big helper in making the face because nothing could cause that shadowing to happen on mars.

I know that some people beleive that aliens are real and some people don't beleive in aliens. I kind of get why people think that in the first place because what possibly can creat such huge thing that looks like an humans face. All you have to do is think about it because it is impossible for there to be aliens around us. We are to far away from other life to be found by aliens; there are trillions of trillions of stars with more planets by them. The possability of them finding us so fast is merely unbelievably impossible in my opinion. So aliens did not make the pyramids on earth and they did not make the face on mars .

Lastly, the face on mars did not get created by aliens; it was created by nature. The only reason we thought we saw a face is because of the old camera that couldn't see it without blurring stuff out. the main reason they told people about the face is just to make some money for nasa in the first place. The face is not made out of metal or some alien material because all it is made out of is rock and the red sand that is on that planet.

44e88b0,"Imagine being a top scientist at NASA and Viking 1 spacecraft ""spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" A lot of people thought of alien life possibility, but others thought it to be just a natural landform. What would your thoughts be about the image? The face of Mars is a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.

To begin, there are similar landforms on Earth to the one on Mars. As stated in the text, ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Also stated in the text is Garvin giving his opinion, ""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

Another issue with the alien life theory is the fact that NASA has high quality cameras. Quoting the text, ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" In the result of having high quality pictures you could see small details clearly. As stated in the article Garvin said, "" 'so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!' "" Concluding that statement nothing other than the landform that had resembled a face was seen on Mars.

Finally, there wasn't enough evidence to support the claim of alien life on Mars. The first pictures were blurry and had haze or cloud coverage. This theory was more popular on the online world than in the science world. As stated in the text, ""the 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" This proves that this might be just for publicity and attention. There has been many conspiracy theorists.

Ultimately, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.       ",3,1,0.84611576795578
44eb982,"Twenty-five years ago, NASA found what looked like a human face on the planet of Mars. Early in the discovery, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. A few days later, NASA presented the image to the public. The picture definitely attracted attention to Mars, which is what NASA wanted. Soon after, the public was let down being told it was just a natural landform and that it wasn't an alien landform after all. However, some people would beg to differ.

There is always possibilities about aliens and what they do in space, but this is not one of them. The face is nothing but a natural landform. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at the face. The text states that Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo with the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters. This proved that all this landform was was something similar to a butte or mesa which is common around the American West. Garvin states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Overall, these two landforms are about the same.

Along with the picture of the face, if anything else was on Mars, we would've seen them with the high quality image. The text stated, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" If any sign of martians was on Mars, we would've been able to see it. Objects such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks would have been able to be identified.

Although, martians could still possibly be out in our universe, this face on Mars will not prove that. Many would like to believe this is a martian mesa but it is nothing but a natural landform. Landforms like this can be found even in places on Earth. The mystery of martians still continues, but the mystery of the face on Mars has finally been a ""case closed"". ",3,1,0.8554376363754272
45076e3,"""So, if you're a NASA scientist, you should be able to tell me the whole story about the Face On Mars, which obviously is evidence that there is life on Mars, and that the face was created by aliens, correct?"" No, twenty five years ago, our Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did.

The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought the natural landform was evidence of life on Mars, and that us scientists wanted to hide it, but really, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. We decided to take another shot just to make sure we weren't wrong, on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, revealing a natural landform, which meant no alien monument. ""But that picture wasn't very clear at all, which could mean alien markings were hidden by haze"" Well no, yes that rumor started, but to prove them wrong on April 8, 2001 we decided to take another picture, making sure it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's team captured an amazing photo using the camera's absolute maximum revolution. With this camera you can discern things in a digital image, 3 times bigger than the pixel size which means if there were any signs of life, you could easily see what they were. What the picture showed was the butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.

""But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?"" You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it? If you still don't believe the evidence the pictures are out for you to see, which obviously shows a natural landform. The reason to not believe these movies and magazines is because they ignore the research. They make up things to get the people going, but what they actually should do is pay attention to us, because we have very important findings every single day. ",3,1,0.9249430298805237
453ecf1,"As a scientist at NASA, I know that this ""face"" found on Cydonia is just a natural landform that makes the shadow of a human face. Natural landforms often make shadows when light hits it at a certain angle. This causes the shadows to form things like faces, animlas, or other things. For example, when Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking photots of possible landing sights for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadow likely to be of a humans face. The shadow made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Some scientists think that the ""face"" could also have been an alien artifact. That may be possible but, its more likely to be a shadow caused by the formation of he land. The ""face"" is caused by rock formations which resembles a human head giving an illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth. More scientists believe that this ""face"" is most likely to be caused by shadows.

454d30d,"Mars is a wonderful planet with many chacteristics. One of these characteristics is the ""Face on Mars"" which was discovered in 1976. Different people have different opinions on it. Some people think it was made by an ancient civilization on mars well others say it is a martian mesa. Which is exactly what it is but some conspiracy theorists like to disagree. Although there is plenty of information to prove them wrong.

First, the original picture was taken in 1976 with a not so sharp camera. Later though in 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over and took a different picture and there was only a blur of a face with non-definant features. At that time people were anxious to see the picture and when they did they were disappointed. People started saying that it was winter and foggy so you couldn't see it. NASA disagreed but went along with what they said.

Next, three years later NASA went up yet again. It was a cloudless summer day in April. They were on the Mars Global Surveyor and captured the photo with the absoulute maximum resolution. With that time of camera you would be able to see a airplane on the ground or any type small shafts or Egyptian-style pyramids. That made most of the rumors end but there was still a few.

Finally there was a group of people who said NASA is hiding evidence from the community because they don't want us to know about it. That was a lie if NASA had found it they would want to tell the world. NASA space exploration fund would have gotten so much that they could study Mars for many more years to come. Some people at NASA were even hoping to find an ancient civilazation. In the end no one got what they wanted.

Therefore almost all the rumors were put to rest. Everyone now believed it was a mesa not a face. Although a face made by a far away ancient civilzation would have been cool to. Now a days people compare the mesa to a butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. So now they have a natural landform comparison.",3,1,0.82965087890625
458a223,"""Unmasking the face on Mars."" Is it created by aliens or not? some may think it's a face created by aliens but we have some evidence to state that the face on Mars is certainly not created by aliens, just another weird formation just like on earth.

The Face on Mars is not created by aliens beacuse when doing research we were able to find that a rock may have hit and the formation of the rock formed to a face. If it ""were"" that aliens had created that it would be impossible especially it being two miles big, we would've seen the aliens. Just like on earth there are weird looking formations that have us saying if it's even possible for it to be here on earth. The unusual shadows that made it look like Egyptian Pharoahs had us thinking twice but it defintely was a councidence. On April 5, 1998 when Mars Surveyor flew over Cyondia for the first time they found it it was just a natural land form and was no alien monumeant after all.

There is more evidence to stating that The Face on Mars was not created by aliens than there is stating that aliens did form it thats why we as in Nasa belive The Face on Mars was a natural landform.   ",2,1,0.8941146731376648

NASA says it is a natural landform becuase it is in the Cydonia region of Mars which has many landform like the Face. They have also done extensive research on the Face and took many photos over the years. Their latest photo was in 2001. This photo was evidence that it had to be natural because each pixel shoed only 1.56 meters which meant that if there was any strage markings or buildings they would easily be seen. NASA also states the the Face on Mars is very similar to mesas on earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, says "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho..."".

With the research NASA has done and with all the photo evidence it is easy to say that the Face on Mars is indeed a natural landform. Everything NASA has done to prove this eliminates any speculation or doubt brought up by the public. The Face on Mars is just another reason to appreciate the beauty of the universe and the hard work of NASA. ",3,1,0.8876907825469971

People come up with these therories and cant support them in the way the were ment to be supported. These pictures we got from Mars are not just supported but we got the pictures with our satelite.

We scientist over in NASA are trying to find ways to expand human nature. People keep saying Aliens did this and thats making us want to explore this more even though the theory can't be supported. We spend billions of dollars a year trying to find these answers to lifes mysteries.

We even supported this in with facts about water on Mars and the mini volcanoes. The landform was a coquencedence that it was caught by our cameras and the fact about it is if this landform happened by aliens wouldn't the camera caught it? The face was first saw in 1976 and it looked like a wave of water splashed over it and dried. The volcanoes could have also erupted and hardened so the landform would have to have been there to heating and cooling of molten lava.

Even though the alien evidence can be proven it still is in the picture. The landform could have been a sign that the aliens put out and wanted help. It could have also been a sign for what is to come. The alien therory isnt well thought out, but in life anything can happen.

The face on Mars could have been anything. The things to come is what is really important. Whether it's aliens on mars or robotic warfare.

The reason people think that is because they believe there are aliens on the other planets. But, scientist did research and found out that is was a natural landform.

The face appeared on the monitors of Jet Propulsion Lab. They figured that it was another Martian mesa. I know that the Face of Mars didn't come from an alien because it was a humans face, they said. Aliens don't have human faces, so thats how it is a natural landform. Even a few scientist thought it came from an alien , thats when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia and snapped a few pictures to get a better look at it.

So, well thousands of sites waited for the picture to appear on JPL web site. It was revealed a natural landform, no alien monument after all. The Face of Mars was not easy to see because it wasn't really easy locating cydonia. The face shows either the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. But there are still people who thinks otherwise so......

In conclusion, The Face of Mars wasn't created by aliens, it was a natural landform. Scientist did their research and even took pictures of the face on Cydonia.

The pictures taken were blurry but showed to actually be a face indicating there was life on Mars sometime in the past or even here in the present. NASA kept studying this mask for years to come. A few years later, another satellite took pictures about 10 times sharper and clearer. But in this picture, the so called mask just looked like a normal everyday landform. The media was not happy with this picture. But this picture did show proof that there was just a landform just like on Earth, that was nothing special. Even one of NASA's global surveyor said that there are landforms on Mars just like on Earth.

This ""face"" on mars is nothing more that a natural landform, no alien monument, no NASA hiding something its just a natural landform, just like the Grand Canyon.

So, why is this so important? Well lets say this is an ""alien monument"" so if it is why wouldnt there be dead bodies on mars or more faces like this one, because this is not an alien monument, its not a corpes its a Mesa just like the ones that we have on earth.

This really can not be anything more than just a natural landform due to the fact that in 2001 NASA took a picture of it and now it doesnt look anything like a face now it just looks like a little hill on the ground. Honestly the seventies were a really superstitious time. So I could see where they saw a face in it, but that doesnt change the fact that in 1976 their camera quality was bad. Even the 1998 picture was starting to reveal that it was just nothing more than a mesa that is certian conditions looks like a face.

Today there have been studies that prove the human brain sometimes has a tendency to make inanimate objects look like a face, in fact today I say a face in the bumper of a car, but I still know that all that was, was a bumper of a car.

The Face on Mars is a natural landform similar to many on earth, like mesa's common in areas like the nevada desert or the grand canyon. Nasa has taken photos of the land form whe never they have been able to get a good shot of it, which is not very often.

Skeptics were far from convinced by the 1998 photos, many of them claimed that NASA had chosen to take the picture during a cloudy period of Mars' year to cover up an ancient alien artifact, or possible markings. Skeptics did not realise that NASA would benifit monumentaly from the discovery of an ancient alien monument on the surface of mars. In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor again was close enough to catch a pitcure of the Face on Mars, the picture spanned a total of 1.56 meters compared to the Viking's 43 meters per pixel photo, The Surveyors photo revealed simply a landform similar to that of a mesa of butte.

The Face on Mars has been a populars icon for many things in the past, and has been used time and time again for debates on ancient alien civilazations on Mars.

46df9c0,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a a butte/mesa landform on Mars, that has started a huge controversy between skeptics and Nasa, because it depicts a human face. At first we were skeptical about the validity of this landmark, and we were not sure about what it really was. Some of our other scientists got on the case and according to paragraph 12 of the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West. People were not going to easily accept this easily.

According to paragraph 5 in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" article,

""It has starred in a Holywood film,. appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--evne haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"". This transformed

and fueled people to start being skeptical about wheather or not it was a sign of life or not. They started to deny that me and other scientists at NASA were telling the truth and even thought that we would rather hide it then tell anyone. I can prove that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform on Mars because, we have taken high quality pictures on a clear day of the landform, we would share with the world if their was life on Mars, and we have studied it enough to see it is just a rock, thats shadows that make it appear as a face.

The first piece of evidence of this Face just being a landform is that we have taken the highest quality pictures possible, and we even did it on a clear day. The pictures were way more high quality then the original pictures, and accoriding to passage 10 ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This showed clear as day what the ""Face on Mars"" really looked like. We then even took more pictures on a clear day because people started to speculate and according to passage 8 ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Us scientists decided we had to take it on a clear day, so we did and now we can tell you that is 100% what the landmark looks like.

The second piece of evidence for the Face only being a natural landform is that if we knew their was life on Mars we would tell the people. We would make a lot of money and we would be able to keep NASA going and get enough money to keep funding us. According to passage 5 ""Some people think that the ""Face on Mars"" is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This just proves my point of we would tell the people, and we would let everyone know because their is no reason for us to hide this from the people, and we would make a lot of money and would be able to keep funding NASA.

The last piece of evidence about the ""Face on Mars"" just being a natural landform is that we have observed the landform for long enough, and according to paragraph 12""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" This proves my point of us being able to identify just from the picture that it is a butte or a mesa, and it is easy for us to know, because we already have some all across the American West. We also know according to paragraph 3 that ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This shows that we have observed this landform for long enough and taken enough pictures that we can identify that it is just a landform that has shadows that just make it portray a human face.

In conclusion me and other scientists at NASA know what we are doing, and would like to inform everyone that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform. We would tell the people about this as quick as possible if it really wasn't, and we would not try to hide it from the public at all. I hope all skeptics understand that we have enough evidence to believe that this is not a human face, that is just a landform, that we have taken enough pictures to understand what it is, and that there is nothing to worry about.",5,1,0.8790565729141235

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia while Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) took pictures of the landform. The pictures were ten times sharper than the one picture the Vikings had revealed. When the image had first appeared on the JPL wedsite, thousands of anxious web surfers were disappointed.

My first piece of evidence is that not everything you see is really what you believed. If you look at the image of the ""Face on Mars"" it really does look like a face, but it turns out that the shape was formed by rocks. These rocks formed together and made it have the shape it has. Just like the montains and hills you see outside. They all have different shapes and that doesn't mean it was made by aliens. Same with clouds, there are many clouds that you see and think ""Oh, It looks like an animal."" That just shows that anything can have different shapes and doesn't mean it was formed by something.

My second piece of evidence that shows that the Face is really just a natural landform and is even proved by scientists. Since the topic of the Face got so popular they actually flew over the area again to get another closer shot of the face. When people saw the new photo they were disappointed to see that it really was just a rock formation and a natural landform. Some people still disagreed and made the team take another picture that revealed it was just a butte or mesa, a landform common around the west. Even someone said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Saying that there are landforms just like the Face. He also said these landforms in Idaho were about the same size of the Face.

There was my information and evidence that proves that the Face really isn't a face and just is a normal landform. You can't always assume that some object is what you think it is, until you actually look closer into it. This was just telling you that it wasnt something made by aliens, but just a normal landform with an odd shape. I hope this made you change your mind on the whole topic.",4,1,0.8834519982337952

There is no Human, or animal that has a face that is that big The biggest animal on earth is a whale, and the face looks like a humans, and humans aren't miles wide and long, so there is no way that that ""face"", is real.

The first picture had very poor quality, and it actually did look like a face, the second picture looked like a mountain with a blur, nothing like the first one, and the final photo was way better quality and you could tell that it was just a landmark, and not a face.

Alien's aren't real, People try and try to find alienlife out in the universe, but they never find it, you know why? It's because Aliens don't exist, so since they don't exist, then there is no way that they made the face, and a pyramid on mars.

I believe that the Face is a natural landform because in the 12th paragraph of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" Jim Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The Face on Mars is actually very similar to many landforms in the American West. Now, you might say that the Face on Mars was built by aliens. But, like I said before, it is similar to many landforms we have to the west of us here in Indiana. Did we, the people, build the Grand Canyon? No, no we did not. Just because a landform looks a lot like a face, does not mean that it was built by the people living there.

In case I have not yet convinced you, I have a statement and a question for you. The Face was said to look like an Egyptian so, how could the ""aliens"" know what the ancient Egyptians look like if they were not there when the Egyptians were prospering? The truth is, they could not know what they looked like because they were not there.

If we were to go back to the 1976 image and compare it to the 2001 image, what would be the difference? If you were to look at the article to the left, you could tell that the image taken in 2001 has better quality and you can see the Face more clearly. Looking back at the images side-by-side, it looks as if the 1976 has shadows cast on it and the 2001 image does not have the same shadows as the first image taken of the Face. In the last picture taken of the face, it looks less like a face because of the big role the shadows play on the first image.

Overall, I think that there are more facts pointing towards the Face on Mars being a natural landform instead of an actual face. Thanks to technology, we can infer that there might actually be a Face on Mars, but I highly doubt that it was actually a real face carved with alien hands. From what I see in the last image, it looks less like a face and more like a landform. What do you see?",4,1,0.8405973315238953
47b9921,"About twenty five years ago from 2001, there was an object found on Mars. When our Viking 1 was scanning the planet to find a safe place for the next space craft to land, Viking 2, Viking 1 suddenly ""spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" The scientists at first, were excited, but then we realized that it was probably a common Martian mesa. We just assumed that ""this one had unusual shadows."" We believe it to be just a natural land form that just happens to have the right shadows to look like a face, not some alien monument.

Soon, we decided that we needed to get a better picture. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take a picture of the Face. The picture was ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" The photo revealed that the Face is just a natural landform. There were no markings on it or anything that could prove the Face to be something like an alien monument or anything made by possible life on Mars.

Then we had people arguing that because of the location of the Face, 41 degrees north martian latitude, and that it was ""winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" People said that our camera would have to look through clouds. Skeptics said ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face.

Although it is very difficult to target Cydonia, on April 8, 2001 we got a second look. This was a ""cloudless summer day."" ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,"" Garvin said. The picture was taken with maximum resolution. As Garvin went on to add, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like arplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion, the Face is just another natural landform. There are no signs of it being made by possible life on Mars. If there were signs even of possible life on Mars, I am sure we would have been able to see clues of it and if the Face was made by them. There is nothing provided to us to suggest hat the Face was made by aliens. We just don't have proof if it. The Face is however very similar to a butte or mesa. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" Garvin stated. The Middle Butte is about the same height as Face on Mars. These things are so similar, it is almost impossible to think that the Face was created by aliens.",4,1,0.860148012638092
47dc813,"The Face on Mars is just an Martian mesa which usually form weird shapes on the surface from time to time. It loks like an alien artificat because of the shadow effect and the way the sand moved it. It is just an natural landform that was just shaped like a pharaoh.

On paragraph 7 states on ""April 5, 1998, When the Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia for the first time, the team took 10 pictures sharper than the original Viking photos"". They later revealed on their JPL web site it was just a natural landform. This point was argued over conspiracy theorist though because it was a cloudy day on Mars. On paragraph 10 they took it again on April 8,2001, where it was not cloudy. They took another picture on the Global Surveyor at maximum resolution. On paragraph 11 Jim Gavin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, came out and said this picure

proved that Mars has no life on the planet. He said "" So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.

On paragraph 12 they say they are a butte or mesa which is landforms common around the American West. They even give an example one saying it reminds him of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". As you can see from the evidence I've given you it is a common mistake to mistake a common landform for an alien creation. I hope this helps you learn and help you in future cases when you mistale something on a planet for a alien artifact or alien creation when it is just a natural creation.",3,1,0.8674412965774536
47de4d6,"""So, what you're trying to tell me, is that out of some kinda coincidence, the face was truly just an illusion due to the shadows?"" the man asked. ""I'm not buying it.""

""Yes,"" I replied, ""and I'm about to show you why I'm right.""

The man momentarily snickered and went on to say, ""I'm all ears.""

The face on Mars has long been debated about whether or not it was pure coincidence, or truly an alien landmark that could spark the truth of whether or not aliens truly may exist on planet Mars. Today, I (Nasa Operative) am going to confirm this coincidence simply as nothing more than Martian terrain with a perfect and unusual casting of shadows to create the illusion, along with the help of the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

To begin, as of the past, technology was not very advanced when the first glance at the face was looked at. As of then, the picture was more blurry, and an illusion was casted. These two go hand in hand, as it makes the landscape look more like a face. However, the recent pictures withold better, sharper, and newer quality in which were taken at different angles and lighting, have proven that the ""face"" was nothing more than Martian landscape. I know this because, ""Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, ' he added.' 'So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West.""

Furthermore, this set of information proves the theory of an alien artifact wrong. Although many still believe the artifact and that it regeardless may be true life is on Mars, the face is irrelevant to an alien theory and has been debriefed as no more than part of a Martian messa.

""Whatever, geek! You're just saying this stuff to put it in my head!"" angrily defended the man.

""The facts don't lie, my friend,"" I replied, ""there may or may not be life on Mars, but there certainly isn't a face.""   ",3,1,0.8157864809036255
47fc3e1,"Some people are arguing that the face on Mars was created by aliens. This however is not true. The claims made by these conspiracy theorists are not legit and are not based on information certified by NASA.

Others are saing that NASA knows that the face was obviously made by aliens but they just don't want to tell us. This is also not true. NASA would tell us if there were signs of life corrisponding with the face on Mars. In fact, NASA would be excited to tell us, for they have been searching for signs of life on Mars. When they took that picture of Mars in 2001, you could clearly see that it was just a natural landform. There were no airplanes or any sign of civilization. There were no aliens lounging or getting a tan on Mars.

Another thing that people forget is that these people who work for NASA are highly intelligent. They didn't go to college for four years then go into this. They went for many years. You know when people dumb things down a bit by saying, ""It isn't rocketscience."" Well this IS rocketscience. It is very hard work to even get a picture of the face. As it said in paragraph 9, Its not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. In fact, its hard work. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. We just dont pass over the Face very often, he noted.

These conspiracy theorists are looking over pictures and information that NASA discovered. It is simply illogical for someone to believe another who has made up a theory that completely goes against what NASA is putting out there. If they are smart enough to come up with a theory that is true then they would work for NASA.

You cannot believe everything you read, especially online. If you are looking for solid information, go to certified websites. Let's say you do want to figure out information about the face on Mars. You go to NASA's official website. That goes for every topic. You want to look for the right information so you can be informed correctly.

I hope I convinced you that the face on Mars was not created by aliens, but is just a simple natural landform. I also hope I convinced you to look for the right information for anthing you need.",3,1,0.8864266276359558
486bd0c,"In the first photo it looks like it is a human face but when it goes to the second photo it look sbasically like nothing. Maybe just like a cloud but nothing really then when it goes to the last photo it looks like it is a hard object but it has cracks in it. In the story it says "" Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars."" it says that something funny happened. It did not happen on purpose so we do not know if it was an alien or another creature.

They thought that it was a Martin mesa but it was common for that to happen around Cydonia. The ""Face"" had an unusal shadow on it like it was made to look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It only loooked like that in the first photo not the second or third. When NASA took photos of the face and put them on the internet everyone basically freaked out because they thought it was a sign for alien life. It could be but there can be many other reasons why it looks like a face. They say that it could be just a natural landform but many people like to think that ""oh it is not it is a sign of alien life"".

The caption on the photo when they posted it on the internet was ""Huge rock formation...Which resembles a human head... formed by sadow giving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."". That was a go getter for attention it looks like they just want to get attention so they can scare people like a lot of people do. It was a good way to engage the public but it was also a bad way of getting their attention. It was bad because a lot of people can get scared because of something they hear and this story did not seem really believeable. A lot of people will believe anything they see on the internet it bacisally does not matter on what it is about they will just believe it.

""The Face on Mars"" had became a pop icon it was on Hollywood films, in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Also in the story it says ""It once haunted a grocery store check out line for 25 years."". That is just crazy that peope will believe things like that ! Sometimes people just want to scare other people and tell them lies about anything. Some people think that the face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. People say that NASA wants to hide every reason from them so they do not find out anything.

They just want to say conspiracy theorists and not tell the truth..... That could be true but in this case I do not think so. The people on NASA's side the denfenders of NASA thinks that NASA's budget wish that there was ancient civilaztion on Mars. If NASA tells people everything about ""The Face"" then people will just spend all their time getting worried about it and want more reasons on why that it is there.

Sometimes things like ""The Face"" can pop up and people just would not know how it happened and why it did happen. They thought that the photo just was not sharp enough to see it cleary. It showed that it just was a natural landform and there was no sign of an alien monument.

It was just a cloudly time of the year and the camera caught the wind blowing and the haze got in front of the photo. They went back on a cloudless summer day to see if they can get a better photo then before to see what it was.

It showed that it was a Martain equivelent of a butte or mesa. Landforms are common around the American West. It showed that it was a lava dome that takes a form of an isloted mesa about the same height as the face on Mars. It was never a sign that aliens were on Mars but aliens could be on Mars and we would of never knew but they took a photo on the wrong night so they had to go back and see it again.

4889825,"This is just a natural landform that has formed on Mars from a long period of time. One there is no such things as aliens but that is only my theroy. A man by the name of Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team went up and took

pictures ten times sharper than the origianl photos. After they got the result and posted it on JPL website saying that it was only a natural Landform that there was no Aliens envolved. Many people didn't like his theroy and I can see why because people want to believe that aliens are real like from the things they might see to the things they hear this just happens to look like something an alien would make to send a message or a sign of some sort.

So I would have to agree with Micheal's theory and evidence about this conclusion. Onestly there could be aliens up there but God never mentioned anything about perimoral creatures living up in space, but then again there are alot of things in this world that we dont know about yet that only God

knows about!! In a way it does look like a face maybe like someone was trying to send a message or something but scientist proved that is was just a landform that was created by itself.

Just taking a moment on this pictures there are so many different theroies about Face and how it got there. All I can say from my theroy I wrote up there is that anything is possible no one has the right answer for everything. We are put on this world to find out where we belong and to explore all different things, but we can expect to know everything God gives us the power to tackle down the stuff we are meant to.

You do, well let me tell you something it was not made by aleins it was made by comets they hit mars and they made the face because aliens are not real they are fake, so they coundn't of made them. See the comets hit mars in the right place for it to make a face. I think that it is stuiped that people still think that aliens are real they are not real!

NASA knows that aliens are fake they just want people to think that they are real so they can get more money by spreding rummers that they found a UFO that has crashed in to the earth and the weriod crop cricles that are made into the corn fields, and they make money off of that crap, I think that is stuiped that they get money on that stuff and then there is other people that are trying to find money just to feed themselfs and there childern .

The face in mars is just a hugh rock that got hit by some comets and the comets hit in just the right places and they made a face in that rock all the other syuff around it got hit to by a comet to so that is why places near the rock are caved in they got hit by a comet.

So comets made the face in the moon not aliens because remeber aliens are not real they are fake so you can go tell other people this story and one day no one will ever think that aliens created the face in a mars rock.",2,1,0.7558137774467468
49373d9,"I truthfully believe this is not created by aliens. Even if the artifact was created by aliens we have no proof of actually seeing them. NASA denies that there is not any other logical proof of aliens, but NASA's budget really wishes there was an ancient civilization. It would mean great publicity and further exploration into science. As a scientist learning about this you may believe anything within earshot. Whatever could seem logical, could not really be what is really right. Confusing as this argument sounds, I really believe that aliens never would have made this artifact. Could something like this happen? Do they really exsist?

Nature is different on mars, how is this effective? Mars has different climates and weather storms that we don't experience on earth. Maybe, the ""face"" is a weathered rock and when shadows cross over it it really looks like a face. Does that seem truthful enough to you? Or even believable? Sometimes when we look at clouds they can be different shapes as what we think they look like. To you, this is artifact that needs further examination. If we could excavate it from Mars we could further our studies on what truly made this rock really look like a face. How could this happen, you may ask? The cost of getting another spaceship to Mars and having a crew does cost alot of money, I understand. NASA made the last possible missions come true, would we be putting the people in that spaceship in danger?

Mars really isn't that safe, that may be why people dont life on Mars without a suit and oxygen tank. Because something bad could really happen up there, and we need contact with earth to tell whats going on. That may put people in danger sending the crew up there. We can only think and hope that the artifact was created by aliens. The face on Mars is an icon for magazines and movies like ""The Martian"" and books like ""The Lunar Chronicles"". A single dicovered thing can turn sellers into money-makers easliy. All these fanatsy in books and movies, really can make us believe what we believe.

Pictures say that shadows make it look like a face. To me the artifact looks like a giant rock, with holes in it. When the shadows of clouds do come along it looks like a face. We may reallly never know who, what, or how this confusing landmark was made. The whole solar system moves around the sun, sometimes they said that they couldnt find Cydonia. Its stuck behind the cloud storms, but this face is really a natural landform on Mars. Now pictures can be photoshopped can't they? If this really was a face why does it look the way it does? From early pictures they turned out blurry and you cant really see the face. I still dont see the face.

Some say the camera doesnt lie, well in this case it may. If aliens were there making these faces wouldnt there be more? it would be a culture to them, or a ceremonial thing. We may never know. All these questions have no answer to them. What is really happening on Mars? Why were the artifacts made, but its really something we will never understand.

If aliens did make the artifact where are they? Wouldnt we see something about them or some weird signals coming from them? Aliens dont really exsist, as much as the subject wraps around our brains, it really leaves us clueless on what we know and what we dont know. Since we really have no proof, I believe that aliens did not make this artifact, found on Mars. I could be wrong to some people, but i believe my claim is true. There really may be a civilization on Mars if we could really think about it and further our studies. But for now i believe this artifact is really just a weathered rock on the face of Mars.

First, it is impossible for there to be aleins because there is no water. Every living organism needs water. Another reason why it cannot be aliens is that when they did a close up they didnt find anything. The camera was special because it caught even the smallest of things. For example, if there was some sort of shack, this camera's lens could spot it, as said in paragraph 11. Another reason why i think that this could just be a coincidence is that every planet has oddly shaped landmarks. For example, earth has rocks hat are all placed in a circle in Ireland.

In conclusion, this why I think that this face on mars is just a coincidence and a landmark. These reasons are why you should believe my theory. Thinking that it is some kind of alien landmark is a uneducated idea. These are my reasons.",2,1,0.7936723828315735

My second argument is this. After the MGS had taken the first photo of the face they still needed better pictures. So there was a picture taken on April 5, 1998 that was ten times sharper than the origonal picture. Revealeing that the face is a natural landform. There is no connection of aliens to the face. People still did not want to belive it isn't a real face. This brings me to my final argument about the Mars face.

My last argument is proof. The MGS got close enough to take a second picture. This time the team used the camaras absolute maximum resolution. Which means that you can see pretty much anything that would be around the face. Things like airplains on the ground, shacks, buildings, pyramids, etc. What the picture actully showed was that the face is a landformation.

This idea is wrong in many levels for instant years later they took another photo and it shows that is was nothing but a butte or mesa, but this still did not stop people thinking other wise. What more do they want, we showed them prove and photos that it was just a normal land mass nothing more. The people weren't statisfied though they thought it was just a cover up, yet NASA would be better off if there was , so why would they hide it if they would be better with it.

My first reason for believing the Face is a natural landform is that if NASA knew anything about aliens or artifacts, then they would probably tell us. In paragraph 5, the author states, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" It's their job, and they would get paid more if they discovered something about aliens.

My next reason is that even if the first photo taken of the Face looked like an alien artifact, the second photo proved that wrong by having a much higher quality.. According to the author in paragraph 11, ""if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were,"" which proves that the Face isn't an alien structure or artifact.

My last reason is that the Face is a mesa, just like the kind we have on Earth. In paragraph 12, the text states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,"" showing how the Face is just a normal landform with strange shadows.

first there were alien markings. from what i know about aliens there very smart. if aliens are smart why not blame it on them. and even in paragraph 8 i qoute it sais ""alien markings were hidden by a haze"" why wouldnt an alien make a face if they have nearly as much intelligence then yes. id have to say the aliens mine as well have done it.

second in the photo from 1998 the photo is very clear it is a face but in the photo from 2001 it is cracked and doesnt nearly look the same maybe a alien could have drew that or really anything not that i have evidence but im just saying if it looks like that. that looks like the creation of a non human. but who really knows.

but you also have to think this a is a nother planet so why wouldnt it be a aliens creation.

so through all ive said what i mean is through a humans creation we are very intelligent, and if aliens are anything like us id say they would have a great chance of creating that. this is another planet so i mean if they did and they lived thier then i mean thats were they live thats there house thier art. over the years the face got different if started to fade. maybe if it was aliens they were trying to tell us something.

There is no factual evidence for aliens making this ""monument"", it is familier to us on Earth, and it would not make any sense for it to be hidden from us.

First of all, there are no facts to support that aliens created this landform. For example, the theory was based on no evidence or facts. No facts even hint to the landform being created by aliens exept that it kind of resembles a face. And there are plenty of chips, and even grilled cheeses that looks like a person, or even Jesus.

Like having no factual evidence, the landform seen in Cydonia on Mars is somewhat similar to things that us humans on the Earth can see. The landform on Mars is similar to landforms that we have on the Earth today. On our planet, there are many mesas, just like the one found on Mars. And we know that the mesas on our planet are created by natrual events or occurences.

Last of all, it would make absolutly no sense for NASA to be hiding that the landform was created by aliens, wich it wasn't. If it were alien made, NASA would tell us, in order to make money. For example, if NASA figured out that it was created by aliens, they would want to tell us in order to make money to expand the Mars exploration program. But, hiding it, they make less money, because people want to know more about othe life-forms, not a lifeless, rusted planet. (but wateer was recently discovered on Mars)

In conclusion, the landform on Mars was not created by aliens, but meerly just a natrual landform. This theory has no factual evidence, can be seen on Earth, and does not make any sense. And, though, there will always be people who will always believe that it was created by aliens, you should now believe other-wise.                           ",4,1,0.8739612102508545

For instance,"" Is there life on Mars?"" and "" Is the Face on Mars a natural landform?"" In, this essay you will read why the"" Face on Mars"" is a natural landform.

There are three different occurings of the face that appeared on Mars.First, you have the Viking 1 that appeared in 1976.Secondly, we have the Mars Global surveyor(MGS) that appeared in 1998. Lastly,we have the latest MGS that grew in the year 2001. All of theses are exotic discoverings from space. But, now we try to find out if they are true natural landforms or more than that.

In this article, NASA and conspiracy theorists argue whether there is life on mars or it's just another natural landform. But, in this case NASA has a budget wish saying that there had been a ancient civilization on Mars.But, once the image first appeared on the JPL website reavealing what they call a ""natural landform"" turns out there was no alien monument after all or an aien monument.

In conclusion, the ""face on Mars"" is most likely a natural landform. The picture shows that

the Martian is equivalent to a buttle or mesa the landforms that are common around the American west. Still, to this day do scientists and conspiracy theorists there miht be life on Mars.           ",3,1,0.8274585008621216

How can people possibly think they are being reached out by aliens that is just so crazy I cant stress that enough. I think if aliens were real why would they want to be found if they are smart like people think they are because they can fly a spaceship then why would they leave that face there for us to find it.

If I was a alien I would not want to be found because who knows what they would do to me I would be so so frighten its not even funny. The other reason why I dont think it has anything to do with an alien is because where is that face from? Is it from an alien or human? How to we know if its even a face it can simply just be a rock that looks like face we do not know sure. For all we know this picture can actually be fake. They might just have wanted people to start thinking its a face and that we are living under aliens. I think my team in Nasa is just crazy straight up crazy.

So this is what I think about the whole alien thing this is not alien related stuff at all. It was never anything about alien stuff or egyption goddess stuff either its jusyt simply a rock that look like a face nothing more notrhig less.      ",2,1,0.693946123123169

Who would even think that there could possibly aliens on mars. Nasa is for the study on space, and just to think yo guys think you know more then them is ridiculous. I understand you have your beliefs, but sometimes you treally just ahev to sit back and say is this logica. If your at the point where you say yeah this is absoulutely right, theres obviously some mental issues going on.

So baed on things in this passge such as the images, you never know the nasa company could b sneaky and photoshop the picture. Just for the controversy thats going on now.

4b2ed69,"What is that mysterious face hiding in Mars? In the acticle ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" its states many different thoughts of different people. NASA has expiremented this Face on Mars and belive that is just another Martin mesa. Although conspiracy theorists like to think otherwise, they do not really have any proof on their beliefs, there for, they do not have many people that follow upon that. Only a few scienetists believed that the Face was an alein artifact.

NASA photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. In 1998, when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, they were able to snap a picture that was over ten times sharper than the original viking photos. This gave everybody a pretty good idea that if the picture was clear enough that it could prove if there was life on Mars or not. The anxcious people were waiting for the picture when they discovered that the Face was nothing more than a natural landform.

Alough the picture had proven that the Face did not show any life on Mars, they just did not believe that the photo couldnt have been right. At the time the Face was photographed, the camera had to peer through wispy clouds. Because the camera may not have gotten a clear shot, people argued with the sam monotnous story that they didnt get a good enough picture and the clouds could have been covering the the markings.

So the question comes back again, is that really a face in the in the ground of Mars? Garvin, a NASA researcher, states that it is very hard to target the face and where it is located. One day on a cloudless summer day, in 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went to take a second look at the Face that held thousands of people speechless on what to belive. Malin's team had managed to capture a picture using the camera's absolute resolution. They discovered that the picture actually shows a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa, landforms common around the American West.

After all the fuss about the Face, it was proven to be just a landform that you you would find on Mars. This uniqe landform kept people wondering for years about what it really was. After many trips into space and passing by the Face, scientists finally got all the proof they needed to prove what it really was. This uncommon feature left the conspiracy theriost's jaws dropped and mouths closed. What do you think that mysterious face hiding in Mars was?",4,1,0.8589504361152649
4b3469e,"It is logically impossible for aliens to create what we call The Face. Although we do not know if such life forms exist, it still could not happen. It would take hundreds, or even thousands of lightyears to travel to the Milkyway galaxy. Extra-terrestrials would most likely have the same life-span as us, or slighty shorter/longer. So they probably couldn't survive the whole trip to our galaxy.

Even though no one knows how The Face was made, there are some more possible explanations. Strong winds could have eroded the surface of Mars and carried its contents to another location miles away from where they originally were.

Some lighter winds could have made indents on the flat part, giving it ""facial features.""

We have no evidence that truly proves that aliens are real. Many pictures that people show of their ""encounter"" just for attention. Others are just hoaxes. On the other hand, we were not there with those people to know that it wasn't true. Yet the lack of evidence says that they don't exist.

How would aliens even know what a human face looks like? They probably would have no idea (if they existed, that is). In the passage it says that The Face resembles an Egyptian pharoh. I don't think that aliens could understand what that was and leave an imprint on Mars that resembles a pharoh.

What kind of technology would they be using? A large laser? Technology/weapons that advanced don't exist yet, so it could not happen. It would most likely take a very long time since it is nearly two miles long. To be honest, I don't think anyone would have the patience to do that. Not even aliens. It could take months or possibly a year, depending on how detailed it is.               ",3,1,0.8364719152450562

For those of you who think that the Face was created by aliens I find that almost impossible. We have been watching Mars for years and have found NO evidence of lifeform or evidence that some lifeform has even been on Mars. I find it pretty hard for someone or something to come and leave the Face on Mars and leave no tracks. There is no true evidence that indicates that there is life on Mars.

As bad as we all wish there was a ancient civilization on Mars; There isn't one.

Even after our chief scientist Jim Garvin photographed the Face in 1997 it was clear that the Face is just a natural landform. There are many times where we have looked at something in our life thinking that it was something that it was not. The Face just happens to be on of those things.

Lets not make this natural landform more than what it is, which is a mesa. As time progressed and our technoloy progressed by 2001 we realized it was not a face. And yes,

I know we all wanted it to be something like a face, But the truth is, it's not. It's literallty just a landform on Mars. ",2,1,0.8986966609954834
4b920ac,"In 1976, the Viking 1 set course to mars. When the Viking 1 was orbiting mars, the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. It looked like a shadowy human face. The question everyone is asking is who are what made this? Was it aliens or is it just natural. If you ask me, this strange looking thing is just a natural landform.

I think it is a landform for a couple of reasons. My first reason is that only a few of my friends from NASA believe that this strange landform was really made by aliens. I also think that this is just a landform because the photo that we took was not very clear and that could have made the landform look like a face.

I also think that this is just a land form because the time of year that we took the one of the photos. When we took the photo in 1998, we took the photo during the winter on Mars and it made Mars sort of cloudy and the Mars Global Surveyer had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the strange landform. Some of my friends from NASA were saying that some of the so called ""alien markings"" were hidden too.

My final reason for thinking that this is just a landform is that when we took the thre pictures and compared them, they all looked different from each other. The picture we took in 1976 looked like the face the most out of the three pictures. The picture we took in 1998 did not have the same details of the first picture and it did not look like a face. The picture we took in 2001 did not have the facial features of the first photo either. Therefore, I think this is just a landform

In conclusion, I think this is just a landform because only a few of my friends believed that it was done by aliens, the photo we took in 1998 was different due to some of the factors of weather, and all three photos looked different from one another.      ",3,1,0.8162199258804321

''The Face on Mars'' is a natural landform found on mars that resembles a human head, but people belive it's an alien landmark. ''The Face on Mars'' is a landform and not an alien because, in the images in the beginning it looks like a head but as technology developed over time and they were able to get clearer pictures it looks more like a landform.

''The Face on Mars is a landform. I say this because if you look at the beginning pictures it looks like a human face, but towards the end it starts to look more like a landform. In the middle of the article it starts to talk about how in the beginning it look liked a face, but the article states, ''April fifth nineteen ninety eight when Mars Globlal Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the orginal Viking photos. ''That is proof that back then their cameras weren't as developed and that in nineteen ninety eight there technolgy wasn't perfect, but able to get clearer pictures to prove it was a landform.

In conclusion, ''The Face on Mars'' is a landform and not an alien landmark because in the images you can see at the beginning it may have looked like a face but towards the end of the pictures it looks more like a landform than a face. When you look at the pictures, I believe that in the beginning I would have believe it was an alien landmark because it does look ike a face. As we see in the pictures it does start to look more like a landform because there technolgy develops so they can get a more clearer picture.      ",3,1,0.8909474611282349

PLenty of peole argue about wether this face was made by aliens or not. In the article ""Face on Mars"" the author gives great detail it was not made by aliens.

Some reasons people know about this landform and believe it was created by aliens. NASA took great photos of the landform. In addition they wanted these photos to bring attiention to mars. Thats exactly what the photos did. Now the face on mars has a very popular landform. ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store chekout lines for twenty-five years.""

There is no credible proof or theroes that this artifact was created by aliens. However Thrier are plenty of great scientist that believe and agree with NASA When it comes to this landform not being created by aliens.

Out of all these years NASA has been working in outer space no proof of aliens have been discovered. In addition if NASA realy

had an idea about there being aliens and wanted to hide it, they would have never released the photos.

There are some people who say the aliens are hidden. The reason some peole say this is because they believe the pictures weren't clear enough. So NASA decided to look again. Further more NASA wouldn't hide anything anyway because if there were aliens it would benefit nasa. So

on April 8, 2001 a summer day with no clouds NASA had to roll the space craft 25 degrees to center the face in field of view they took a photo at maximum resolution.There were no other things like shacks, pyramids, or air planes. What the picture does show is a landform very common around the midwest. Thats why plenty of people believe it is a natural landform.

In the article ""Face on Mars"" there are plenty of facts that show you aliens did not create the land form. People will still argue wether it was created by aliens or not. However logic shows it is a natural land form.",3,1,0.9029834270477295

Don't you think that with our intelligence, we would know if something that looks like alien evidence actually is alien evidence? We would not only let everyone know, but we would make a very big deal out of it. This is just a natural landform.

I know it is silly that there is literally a face on Mars, but it's not as big of a deal as you think. Have you ever looked at the leaves in a tree or the coulds in the sky and seen something put together that resembles an animal or shape? This is kind of like that. It's cool, but it doesn't exactly mean the universe is trying to give you a sign of life. When we released these photos to the public, people thought for sure we were hiding something like we had an agenda to have an alien takeover. They said it was ""bona fide evidence of life on Mars"". Trust me, we wish there was life on Mars! That would be ground-breaking news! We are not hiding a single secret, and we are speaking the truth.

Perhaps, of course, we will find life on the red planet someday. This landform is not evidence to support that moment. On a bright and clear day on April 8, 2001, we took a very high-detailed photo of the face. If there were any outstanding undeniable resemblinces to a human face, we would've seen it. It is much like any other landform from the American West, like a certain one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Truly any other butte or mesa, just this time its on a different planet.

So, afterall, it's settled. This face-like landform on Mars is not a sign of any martians or aliens, sadly. Conspiracy theorists will go on with their unreasonable theories and we will stick to the cold hard facts, thank you very much. I hope you have realized just how wrong everyone has been and just how much more logical you should be thinking. Don't get me wrong, I and most workers at NASA certainly belive in aliens.

4c8547d,"I am a scientist and I belivie that the Face on mars wasn't created by an alien. Looking at pictures I can see that the Face dosen't look like a human at all. In 1976 the Face was funny looking and later on in the years the Face blured out. It looks like a natural landform because people think just because it has eyes and a nose.

According to the arictle states the scientist belived the Face was an alien artifact. But I think how would you that it's an alien the world has so many different fetures, and creatures everywhere you may never know. Even though know ones probaly every seen an alien before. It may have been the shape or form they way the ground grew, and it just turn out to look like a face.

Then the found out on April 5,1998 that Micheal Mailn snapped a picture ten times finding out it was just a natural landform. I wounder why they thought that it was an alien. They got a camera on board to see if another may have poped up scientist checking it. If they would find one then it would be proof ,because now they have a camera on board to see.

I think that the rule of thumb is great because you can't discren things in to image 3 times bigger. It may look like something that it's not and apper wrong to look like an creature. What the picture actually shows is Martian equivalent butte and it and the Amercian West landforms are both in comman. It's a lava dome that takes form of a islated mesa looking ,and having same hieght of the Face on Mars.

I think that you shouldn't asume that something or someone is what it isn't. You always get facts and debate and reason more. And find out if your reascreah may have been wrong going thur the process. There mistake in the long run was making the image bigger than what it is was.

NASA would have no reason to try and cover up any evidence proving there was an acient civilization on Mars. If the Face truly was an acient alien artifact, the news of this discovery would actually benfit NASA and might help them get a bigger budget. Why wouldn't NASA tell the public about such an amazing discovery that might truly benifit them?

NASA even spent a lot of hard work and money to pass over the Face and prove to the public that this was nothing more than a natural landform.

Many scientist have proven time and time again that the Face is just a simple butte or mesa, which are actually common landforms around the American West. Detailed photos were even taken that prove this fact, the so called Face is a simple Martian mesa.

Even though many people including myself would like to believe this an acient alien artifact, there are just too many facts proving this theory wrong.

4cd774a,"The ""Face of Mars"" isn't really a face. It only looks like one. It's because of the land and the shadows it gets, from different angles. It may look more like a face at other angles, and it also maybe just looks like a big blob of land. So it's not a face. Also if anyone was able to create that it'd be impossible because no human being could live there. There's no oxygen there. So it'd be impossible if someone created that, there on the planet Mars.

Yes, when they did first discover the ""Face on Mars"" everyone thought it was a face on Mars, but over the years it became a whole lot easier to see. At first the photo taken in 1976, was a very blurry picture, not high quality on that first one. Then the second one, taken in 1998, it sort of still looked like a face, but not as much as the first photo. Then the last one taken in 2001, you could see and tell that it wasn't a face. It was just the way you would look at it. At different angles. So it is really all your say, not mine.

It only looks like a face because of the shadows and the landform. The huge rock formation has given everyone the illusion of it having eyes, nose and a mouth. When none of that stuff is really there, in the first place It just looks like it's there, but in reality it's not. Nothing is there except for rock formations and a whole bunch of different landforms. There's also one weird and unusual shadow that made the rock formation look something like an Egyptain Pharaoh.

It just all depends on if you still think it looks like a face. It's all your opinion, not mine. Ihave no say in what you think it looks like. We don't see everything in the same way, no one does. So if you think it looks a face still then to you it's a face. But to me it's just some landform that looked a lot like a face when the first photo that was taken in 1976, it looked a lot like a face.

It also states in the article that the Face on Mars is more equivalent to a butte or a mesa which are natural landforms. Although people may have wondered if there was lifeform on Mars, technology wasn't as advanced back then. As years went on, technology became greater, and we were able to use that technolgy to see if there was signs of life.

The Face, a well known landmark on the planet of Mars, is a landmark that has caused NASA a lot of debate. The debate is ""Was The Face created by aliens, or was it created by natural landform?"". This has caused NASA and many scientists to have problems, because there are a few scientists that believe that The Face was created by aliens.

The Face was originally discover in 1976, by the photographers aboard NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In the picture taken in 1976, you can clearly see a face in the landform. But in the picture taken in 1998, the atmosphere was extremely cloudy, so if there was any indention in Mars's base, you couldn't see it because of the clouds. Because of this, scientists went out on another attempt to capture a good image of The Fcae on Mars, and they succeeded.

The picture that was taken in 2001 clearly showed that The Face was no longer there, which lead scientists to believe that it was a combination of natural landform and the shadows casted from the sun's rays that made that particular spot look like           ",2,1,0.8919085264205933

Another reason is that Mars could've got hit by an astroid that came from the Astroid Belt, or maybe could've had a volcanic eruption. I know this because in the passage from the article it said, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural land form.""

Another passage form the article says, ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" I believe that Mars had signs of life, and water in the passed, but now Mars has changed and is still changing over time. Mars does not have water anymore, but theories show thats there might some signs of living on Mars. And that is why I believe that the image of the face on Mars is just a natural landform!!!",2,1,0.8535082340240479

They first picturer was taking in 1976 NASA was amazed they also thought that their was life on mars.It was until they took a picuturer agin in 1998.They stared to see that the face cloer and see who it realy looked.But lots of people still believe that that it was a sign that their was life on mars.They keep trying to givee them evidance to say that their is no life on mars.But the captin of NASA noted a ""huge rock fromation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows given the illusion of eyes,nose,and,mouth.""

But people still though that it was life on mars.an they more people stareed to believe that it was not a sign that their was life on mars.Them they took another picture of the face on mars in 2001 and that is when people stared to believe that it was not,that it was just an illusain that made it look like it was a face on mars.

In arguments like this there are other sides to every story then theres a great sum of people who think its fake that they faked it to get attention or get the community on this fact ,Because they might be working on something else so no-one looks into it.

In 1976, they first found out about this so called face. A spacecraft for NASA was circling the planet, taking photo's when spacecraft 2, spotted the shadowy likelyness of a face of some sort. The face looked like it was looking back at the camerafrom the region of the planet called Cydonia. The Face was also nearly 2 miles long from end to end! But everyones opinion is different. My opinion is that its a natural landform on the planet, Because why would some aliens make such a thing like that to just leave in the ground on that planet.

I think it was just an astroid hitting the planet and flying some of the debree's to a pile that looks like a face in a certion type of year. The shadows go over the pile of planet chunks to make it look like a human face. Also when that photo was taken in 1976 the camera's back then were very pixellated not high definition where you can see the detail, in 1998 the camera's were getting a little better as you see on the article about this ""Face on Mars"" it looks like the so called face is deforming because it has been there for 12 years since the last un high definition picture.

In 2001 the picture shows that the face looks cracked maybe, Because back then the camera's were not as good you couldnt see the detail, But now in 2001 the cameras start having greater detail so is that why u couldnt see the cracks in the other pictures? The world may never know until someone goes to mars to investigate.",2,1,0.8707173466682434

One thing will not prove anything there are no signs of homes or even indented marks of other species being there only this simple marking. Well i beg to plead the opposing side see what you have seen from 1976,1998, and 2001 is technology has proccesed this and its clearly nothing but a mark. Your conspiracy will live on if this was a life form why would it only be one life form? where are the others there are no trace of them a form of life can not just be created by nothing it has to reproduce. There is only sign of one so there for it does not exist as of the evidence given it is simply just a mesa, a mesa is a rock formation.

this is just a coincedence that it looks of so nasa revealed they wish there was life form to give us more to study of but not much evidence comes from a plain old rock that looks like a face. in conclusion you personally will not change your mind about this becuase it a conspiracy life has been held up by this making money off of this rejoicing of nothing but a rock. Just like area 51 another conspiracy theorys where there is claimed to be unexposed life form when really its just a testing site for us millitary. Also the illumanati claimed to be the ones running the music industry and society. there many conspiracy theorys, but maybe just maybe theyare controlling us of what they dont want us to know making people think the conspiracys are a joke when in reality they are true.

Groundbreaking news has been unleashed to the public. NASA has found a face on Mars! However, it is really a face?

NASA declared the ""face"" to actually be a martian mesa. Although, some people believe that it is a face that was made by aliens.

Scientists believe that the ""face"" on Mars is actually a landform. According to paragraph seven in the article, ""Thousands of anixous web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform."" NASA had a picture to prove that it was not an alien monument.

NASA

had also compared the martian mesa to other mesas around the western United States, according to paragraph twelve in the article. NASA had also mentioned that the pictures in the past had worse resolutions than the ones we have today, which can be one of the main factors of having the martian mesa look like a face.

NASA had taken the first picture of the ""face"" in 1976 and the last one in 2001. Over the years, NASA has spent lots of money on this project. All of their hard work and money has paid off. Due to their large interest, they were able to figure out that the ""face"" was a martian mesa. Their huge discovery led to learn about landforms on Mars. They had sucessfully unmasked the ""face""

4eaf0a7,"Twenty five years ago when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting mars looking for possible landings sights for Viking 2 it spotted a ""face"" on mars in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. NASA revealed the images of this ""face"" thinking that it would be a good way to attract attention to mars. It worked too, maybe not in the way NASA had hoped though. This ""face"" caused many people to belive that it was proof that there is or was life on Mars.

NASA explains this ""face"" formation on Mars as a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Many skeptics believe that this ""face"" is proof of life forms on Mars and that NASA is just trying to cover it up. Although if this was proof of life forms on Mars then that would greatly benefit NASA so why would they try and cover it up? Well the answer is they wouldnt. If there was any proof that there was life forms on Mars then NASA would benefit greatly and they would most likely reveal that to the public as well, not hide it.

So what is this ""Face of mars"" that has had so many people questioning NASA and skepticizing over whether or not there is life on Mars? Well, the latest picture was an MGS image from 2001. This image shows the ""Face"" for what it actually is, which is a mesa. As it says in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

This lattest image has been able to show us what the rock land form on Mars actually is. Which is just a mesa. Slowly since the image from the NASA Viking 1 in 1976 we have been getting better and better quality images. With these better quality images we are able to see that this rock land form on Mars doesnt even really look like a face. Slowly the pictures have gotten less hazy and we have been able to better see the ""face.""

When you look back on that first image, the one from the Viking 1space ship in 1976 its easy to say that the land from on Mars looks like a face. Because it does look like a face in that first bad quality image, but now that we have new technology with better photo taking abilities it is easy to see that what we once may have thought looked like a face. Is just a mesa on Mars. Not proof that there is aliens, or other life forms on Mars. Just a Mesa, that in all reality doesnt actually look all that much like a face.    ",5,1,0.885834813117981
4f0c13d,"¨The Face¨

People think that ¨The Face¨ is created by aliens,but it is actually the Face is a natural landform. So here is how I´m going to support my claim with evidence from the article.

First of all,I claim that the ¨Face¨ is just a natural landform. According to the article the scientists used the camera´s absolute maximum resolution so if there were objects in the picture they would see it. The rock formation resembles a human head,eyes,nose,and mouth, so we understand why people think it was a face created by aliens.

Second of all,According to paragraph 12 ¨what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West¨(12).If it was created by aliens it would not be hard to find because there would be more then just one.¨That´s a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars¨(12).

In conclusion,I think that the Face is a natural landform. There are evidence from the article to support my claims.¨Malin´s team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera´s absolute maximum resolution¨(10).¨If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were¨(11)!",3,1,0.9204882979393005
4f2f54f,"We all have an imagination, do we not? The people in 1976 had an imagination. I think the ""Face on Mars"" is just a regular landform. I think the face is a landform, because they don't have any proof of life on mars, it couldn't have been a Martian mesa, and with or without clouds, the face was not seen again. Even if it was to been seen again, we do not know if would be a shadow or a actual mesa.

First off, the Face on Mars doesn't have a lot of backup proof about it. The article says that in 1976, Viking 1 was orbiting around mars, when it snapped a photo of a shadowy likeness of a face. That is just it, a shadowy likeness of the face on Mars. We do not know if it is a mesa or not unless we actually scim the face of the landform I see, in my opinion.

Next, it couldn't be a Martian mesa. If their was any source of life besides the ice caps Mars has, there is no remains of people or any housing or animal life anywhere.Without this life on Mars, the mesa would be impossible to build on Mars, making it just a landform.Like the article states, ""So, if their were objects on the ground like airplanes or egyptian-style pyramids... you could see what they were!""

Lastly, even in a couldy situation or not, we never saw the face again! In 1976, the camera might have just made the landform look fuzzy. After the two pictures NASA took in 1998 and 2001, their was never any outline of a face or anything anymore. It was just a bunch of landform shaped like a regular mountain.

To conculde, the face on Mars was just a landform. We know this through the fact that it could not have been built without population, in a couldy situation or not we never seen it again, and it couldn't of been a martian mesa. I think people got to carried away by the fact that there would ever be life on mars. We never fully know yet, but in my opinion, the face on Mars is just a landform.",3,1,0.8077501654624939
4f584fc,"Have you ever thought something was another thing when it wasn't? Have you ever had to let people down by telling them what it actually was? Surprisingly, NASA has done this before. NASA had sent one of its spacecrafts, the Viking 2, to search for their first protogy named the Viking 1. While it was in search for it the Viking 2 discovered what appeared to be a human face.

NASA unveiled the picture of ""the human face"" for everyone to see. They thought it would be a good way to attract attention to Mars. And, sure enough it was! Everyone loved the idea of the ""Face on Mars"" so much that people started to write books about it, base movies on it, and people on talk shows would even make conversation on it! The only negative side was scientists didn't really believe the Face was actually alien artifact. And it was soon proved that it was only shadows that made it appear the shape of a human face. Scientist described the Face as just a mesa or a butte, and really it is nothing more uncommon than a natural landform. Even in the article they described the whole theory as just ""somthing funny"".

People weren't very satisfied when NASA had to break the news that the ""Face on Mars"" was nothing more than science fiction. In conclusion it wasn't really anything interesting at all unless you find landforms all that and a bag of chips. The ""Face on Mars"" is now just a silly theory we made in the past and nothing more. There's no argument on weather it's real or not because most scientist to begin with were skeptical on the theory of it being an alien artifact.

In May 24th, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling arounds Mars taking picutres of landsites for its sister ship, Viking 2. When looking around a shodwy likeness of a face was spotted. This head stretched nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to stare back at thee cameras. When releasing the the images for all to see, few scientists thought it may have been an alien artifact.

Others such as I, a NASA scientist, think otherwise. I, along with many others think this landform naturally occuring. How could it be that for years upon years we just would not have noticed alien life? There have always been rovers roaming around the often cameras catching pictures. Over a progression of time the face has become more noticeable. Naturally occuring things come over periods of time, such as this ""face"" has. Alien life has never been proven or even found. There is no factual or scientifical evidence to follow up on such assumptions.

Until proven otherwise, I will continue to believe this face is a naturally occuring thing. If science comes along, or even the Aliens to prove this landform, I will then believe the Face was made by Aliens.

4f6582d,"While NASA's greatest scientists were working hard in their Jet Propulsion Lab in 1976, an eerie picture appeared on their monitors, as the spacecraft they sent to Mars, the Viking 1, has taken a picture of what looks like an alien-built human face on Mars, though it was actually another basic landform on the red planet. The reason Viking I was taking pictures of Mars was to scope out possible landing sites for its sister ship, the Viking 2. The scientists did realize that this ""face"" was just another common Martian landform, so when they put the picture up, its caption stated that it was only a rock formation resembling a human head. In order to fully prove to everyone that the Face on Mars was just a landform, they even sent the MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, to retake pictures of the area presumed to be the face. They even sent it back for another round of retakes thanks to peoples' suspicions of cloudy weather blocking the view of the face! Thanks to many tests and retakes, scientists have proven that the Face on Mars is just another landform.

While Viking 1 was taking pictures on Mars to find a landing site for Viking 2, it snapped a picture of what appeared to be a gigantic face staring at them like a man staring at the stars with binoculars. Although scientists were very surprised when the face appeared on the monitors in their lab, their sensation lasted only a short time. They figured it was only another common Martian mesa with shadows that only resembled a human face. So that they could get enough hey-everyone-check-this-out popularity for the red planet, they made the image of the Face on Mars public, and the NASA scientists gave it the caption noting that it was ""a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Thanks to this new caption, public attention for Mars, but it ended up dominating people's view on Mars, making them create conspiracy theories rather than convince the truth that it was only another landform on Mars. Despite the people making the Face on Mars a well-known pop icon, it always was and always will be another Martian landform.

In order to prove to the people that the Face on Mars was an ordinary-as-white-paint landform, they sent a new probe, the Martian Global Surveyor, or MGS, to Mars in 1998 to try to retake pictures of the face. The MGS succeeded at its task, as it swayed public opinion away from the idea that the face had to do with alien life existing on Mars at that time. Thousands of looking-forward-to-this web explorers were waiting for the picture to become public, they were also disappointed by the fact that it was a natural landform rather than an exotic alien monument. However, not everyone was satisfied with these results, as they wanted more proof that the face was a face and not a landform thanks to cloudy weather. The MGS did succeed in proving that the Face on Mars was not a face, though more attempts were required to get the idea to everyone.

Not everyone was content with the results of the MGS expedition, wanting to believe that the cloudy weather at the time the picture was taken to be responsible for the lack of the face's visibility. Despite how NASA's chief scientist for their Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, stated that ""it's not easy to target Cydonia,"" the people wanted more retakes. NASA was able to get the MGS to get better shots of the face in April 2001, and they were able to capture a wonderful photo with the camera's maximum resolution, which dominated the Viking 1's resolution by being nearly thiry times better. Thanks to Garvin's reasoning and the high-as-the-sky resolution of the MSG's new pictures, they were able to prove that the face was only the equivalent of a butte or mesa, both of which were common landforms. Thanks to the MSG's multiple trips, they captured enough well-detalied pictures to prove the true identity of the Face of Mars.

The Face of Mars is only an ordinary landform, and it always will be just another ordinary landform. The scientists began with a caption to the original photo stating that it was a landform only resembling a face, then they sent the Mars Global Surveyor out to try to prove that the Face on Mars was a landform. They also later sent the MGS out again during not-cloudy-at-all weather to let everyone know for sure that the face was not a face. All of these efforts combined let people know how the Face on Mars was not a face but only a landform, but there are likely still people out there who belive that the Face on Mars is still some type of alien relic. Despite how popular the conspiracy theories about the Face of Mars being an alien monument, it was only a standard landform the whole time.",6,1,0.8592957258224487
4f70228,"The face on Mars is a very interesting thing. It looks like a human head but there is now way it could be because it is two miles long. Some people say that is was made by aliens. NASA says that it is just a rock formation that happend naturaly. There are many arguments for both sides. I'm going to tell you the arguments from the side that says it is just a natural rock formation. This face on Mars is a natural rock formation because, if it were made by aliens than when they got close to it they would have saw things that would be unatural. Another reason is it looks like buttes and mesas that we have here in the United States. Lastly we have been studying this for twenty five years and never before has an alien came up and said, ""Hi I made this"".

The first reason why I thin that this was a natural formation is that we have gotten realy close to the formation and never have we seen any aliens or even any buildings other than the face. On April 8,2001 it was a cloudless summer dday in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how close they got to the planet and they never had anything happen to the nor did they see anything. Thust proving my first point.

Another reason this formation is natural is that there are formation in the United States that have naturlay occured. Buttes and mesas look very similar to the face on Mars. This is what NASA says about it ,what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This shows that there are very simmilar things to the face in our world today. Thus proving my second point.

Lastly we have been studying this thing for twenty five years. NASA has been taking pictures of it for a long time now and they have not found any signs of life on Mars. Some people would say that NASA is hiding stuff. NASA would not hide stuff like this for many reasons. Here is what they say about it. The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Thus proving my third point.

So in conclusion there are no signs of alien life on the planet. This is how NASA concluded there point. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This proves that even though several people think that there is life on mars there is no life and this is a natural formation.                        ",5,1,0.8931164145469666
4fa782f,"In this argument I'm going to tell you why the face on Mars, is acually a landform.

On the red planet called Cydonia A.K.A Mars. Twenty five years ago NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars snapping photos of landing sites when they came across a landfrom that looked like a human face. When scientist saw the picture they thought it was just another martian mesa, that is common around in Mars, but it had unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA showed the image for all to see. The caption was ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth."" They thought it would be a good way to attract attention, but some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization in Mars, although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact. The first image appered on a web site, revealing... a natural landform it was actually a martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landform common around the american west

That was my argument I hope you will take my side that the face was not created by aliens and it was mearly a landform.",2,1,0.9154717326164246
4fa7dae,"Gerald was one of the scientists that led the investigation on the Face. He had been to college already, so he has been very experienced with these types of scenarios. He used NASA's Viking 1, and saw an object that appeared to be a face. He got a closer look later in his career, and it was not an actual face. This was later taken by surprise by the general public, and they still thought that it had to be a real sign of life on Mars. Because of this research, I believe that the face is just a natural landform. Three reasons why I believe this is true are that NASA's research has proven this, photographs taken by NASA have shown that this is true, and comparisons to landforms on Earth have shown the public that this is the truth.

My first reason for stating my opinion would be that NASA's research has proven that the Face is a landform. An example of this from the text would be that NASA has published many photos of the Face to show the public that it was just a landform. To further explain this, if you look close enough at the pictures in this passage, then you can see it is a landform. It may look like a face from a far distance, but evidence given by NASA has shown that this is not the case.

My second reason for this is the fact that NASA has taken many photographs of this landform to prove it is true. Here is a quote from the text that shows this: ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Later in this paragraph, it states that the picture has proven that there was not an alien monument. Secondly, as people stated, it was a cloudy day in Mars, so they were not satisfied with the picture. So, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Later in the paragraph, Garvin, an expert that works with NASA, says this: ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Even though it wasn't cloudy, the team of NASA got the same result: it is just a landform.

My last reason would be that comparisons to landforms on Earth have proven that this is true. Garvin says in paragraph twelve that ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" What this is saying is that there have been similar landforms on Earth that are on Mars. Scientists can use this data to compare different pieces of landforms on different planets. Using this, they can figure out what the Face actually is, and other mysteries that they come up against.

Some people may have used to say that the picture was too blurry to make out what the Face actually was. However, NASA has taken many clear photos of the Face, and they have proven several times that it is not an alien artifact, and that it is only a landform on the surface of the planet.

So, what do you think now? Do you still believe that the Face is an ancient artifact? Well, you should not anymore after reading this; the evidence given here in this essay clearly shows that the Face is just a landform. Scientists like Gerald and Garvin have shown this a repeated amount of times. So, in conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, and not proof of life on Mars.",5,1,0.8268484473228455

Most people think there is alien who live there do. They say it maybe it for living thing for alien. I think it just a natural land form because there is no alien monument.

First, The face of the mar really is popular for other. It even appear on hollywood film, books,magazines, and radio. Maybe it just not close enough to see if it flat or it like mountian. It show a lot of stuff going on on mar. Mar is really history for people in may 24,2001.

Next, I think it just natural land form because on the shadow it look like pyramid. If you look at the shadow and you can see it not it have to much pointing on the top. The eyes waht they call it might be the whole for some water. the mouth can be just a crack on it.

Finally, if we can go look closer scientist NASA might catural n tell. They just look at the front they won't know how it shape like to look side to side. Scientist NASA will have to look closer so they can tell if there is alien or not. It depend on to look closer. It just landform because it did have no alien monument.

Conclusion, this is all about face of mar well it truth, but if you look at the shadow it show only triangle. it will be better for scientist to look closer instead just making up stories about unmasking the face on mar. It just natural for land to have mountain, and there is no such an alien. according to ther text""There was no alien monument after all"".",2,1,0.623253583908081
4ff6343,"The"" Face on Mars "",this was a therory that even scientist couldn't figure out until 2001. The space probs most liikely sent false information that made them belive that it was a face, when in reality it was just a huge rock formation. Also, in the place that this site was located they are to belive that these things are common in this area. It was the shadows of the rock formation that gave off the belief to be a human face in the rock formation.

NASA states that new high resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is : A mesa. Also, it says that another group of people went to Mars and as soon as they could get a photo of it the the minute that they could.When they put it on the website there were already thousands of anxious web surfers waiting ,so when the image appeared they could identify it as a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all.

Even though they came to a conclusion many people still had doubts about it, so they prepared to look again. They said it's not easy to target Cydonia, so Mars Global Surveyor drew

in closer to the surface and luckly enough it wa not an alien monument.These facts state that there were no aliens on Mars because aliens are not real and they most likely will never be.",2,1,0.914821982383728

First,Nasa spacecraft went around circling the planet for his sister ship,when they spotted human like faces.They knew it was a face because two miles from the end to end it appears that the face was staring back at them.After that happened they revealed this amazing discovery to the world to see.

Next,these faces on mars surface are now known to be seen as pop up icons.These faces are featured in Hollywood films,books,magazines,etc.Since these faces became popular most people think that this is evidence that there is human life on mars.The human faces are so out there they are saying that these faces were seen in haunted grocery stores for 25 years!

Finally,when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first,Michael

and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking 1.When they did this thousands of people were waiting for the pictures to come out on a website called JPL revealing a natural landfrorm.Some were not satisfied because they said it was wispy clouds that the camera had to peer through.So,basically what they are saying is how did that camera captured such great pictures of the faces through all the clouds.

In Conclusion,what im saying in my statement is that this a natural landform aliens didnt create these faces.If aliens created these human faces they might have not looked so human realistic for instants ,they might have had some type of alien feature on them.Also,if these human faces were made by aliens the world woulnt have been that interested in them.",3,1,0.8785905241966248

5020b8d,"Imagine it's 1976 and Nasa reveals an interesting photo looking down upon Martian landscape. The photo catches your eye as it contains what apears to be a giaint face made of rock coming out of the sand. Nasa states that the ""face"" is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. But you also hear other people saying that the face is an ancient alien artifact! What do you believe? Pop culture quickly jumps on the idea of aliens because that view point is exciting. Meanwhile NASA is a government backed and very credible source. I say that the educated person would listeto NASA. I believe that the ""face on Mars"" is just another natural landform becasue the face looks just like a butte or mesa does on Earth, NASA's powerful cameras haven't captured anything alien looking on near the face, and becasue the majority of NASA and other creidble scientists don't believe that the face is alien.

According to the article Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the area where the famous picture of the face was taken. There is nothinig unusal or different about this specific mesa exept the shadows on top of it. These shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Mesas and buttes are landforms that are also very common on Earth around the American West. The Middle Butte in Idaho is a an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. I'm sure if pyramids started being discovered on the surface of mars thats one thing, but just a single mesa that looks a bit like a face is no reason to immediatly blame aliens.

Another reason why the face is just a natural landform is because we have seen proof that is nothing but a landform.. On April 8, 2001 which was a cloudless day in Cydonia, another picture of the face was taken with a very powerful camera that used its maximum resolution for the picture. When you look at this picture it is almost hard to immgine a face even being there! The illusion of a nose, eyes, and a mouth is gone. All that remains in this picture are some cracks and rough edges on the rock structure. To many seeing is believing and this picture has allowed many to see the truth that the ""face on mars"" is nothing but a myth.

Some suporters of the idea that the structure was created by aliens argue that NASA is hiding more evidence and mabey even distorting images that point to the face being built by aliens. This is wrong because alien civilizations would increase NASA's funds and popularity. Also it would be almost immpossible to keep an alien secret from the public with so many immployees knowing. These examples show why the ""face on mars"" is just another natural land formation.",5,1,0.929696798324585
504953b,"The Face is a natural Martian mesa, like many others. People have wondered if aliens have built it before, but they had no proof. NASA has already proven with evidence it is just a natural land formation.

First, NASA decided to release the pictures of the Face for the public to see, but they only did this to get more people intrested in Mars! To prove that the Face was just a land formation naturaly made, NASA decided to show better quality photos to the public. So they sent out pictures that were ten times sharper to show it was a ROCK formation. Also if there was life on Mars NASA would benifit from it, so i dont see why they would lie.

Next, Mars is a planet with many unknown discoverys but the ones that NASA do figure out the more information we gain for the future. For example in the text it says that Mars has many Martian mesas, so it could be a coinicidence that ONE looks like a face. This doesn't prove there isn't life on Mars but for the information we have at the moment it is doubtful.

Lastly, There are many people in the would who make this stuff up, so why would believe THEIR opinion over NASA who research on space. Don't forget that the only reason they got the information of the Face was because NASA unvieled it. If they had something they didn't want us to know about they would have kept it to themselves.

The Face is just a rock formation. Others might say something like it looks like a human face, or why would it look like a face if the life on Mars hadn't built it. The reason it looks like a face is because the mesa formed that way. It couldn't even have been built by life on Mars because it's over 2 miles wide, so it has to be a land formation.",4,1,0.90566086769104

A lot of people were not happy with this conclusion. They argrued that the face was 41 degrees north of the martian latitude where it was winter at the time of the picture.

When the picture was taken it was a cloudy day on the planet and the camera had to see through several cloud layers to see the face. Some say this blocked out any chance to see alein markings.

After doing the test and reasche they have concluded that there is no real sign of aleins and it was just a massive landform.

The reason why I would say that is because they could find out there own self if it was a alien face or if it was a natural landform. But I would also tell them that aliens isn't real. If they would still be arguing then I would kinda talk to them about it.

I would tell them that you can read about it. It could be someones face that visited there a long time ago. The reason why I say that is because it probably is really hard to shove your face in a moon rock. You could ask someone that reshearch stuff like that. It seens to the (MGS) and (NASA) that it was hard to get pictuers of the face.

The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April at 98, it was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The reason why there are so many storeys about the face on Mars is because the scientest didn't know if they should beleve if there really was a face on Mars or not. So thats when (NASA) went and saw it with their own eyes.

In the pictuers in the passage you can tell during the soan of 1976-2001 the face has gotten clear. But in 1976 the face was all blurrey to where you can barley see it. In 1998, it doesn't quite look like a face but it is still kind of blurrey to where you can hardly tell its a face, and then in 2001 it was the shape of a face but you stilll can't see the eyes or mouth or nose yet.

50e3c8f,"People might want to believe that the Face is created by aliens but it is not, it is a natural landform. The Face is just a natural landform because it is just the shadows that make it look like a face, the landform is also common around the American West, and it is a mesa.

The shadows are the ones that make the Face on Mars look like a face. In the third paragraph in the article it stated ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The reason there is alot of commotion about this is that ""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" He was right because it did.

The Face is also just a landform because there are landforms located in the American West that are also mesa's like the Face. In the last paragraph it said ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Therefore, people are just altering the true facts to make a story of it. The reason many did not believe it was a Matian mesa is because ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

The Face is just a mesa because it said in the text various times that it was just a mesa. In the very beginning it said ""New high- resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" It also said in the last paragraph "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."" That shows that the Face is just a natural landform like any other.

Others say that aliens live there and created the Face. In the eight paragraph it said ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Although that might be true in the eleventh paragraph it said ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

Finally, there might be different speculations on wether or not the Face is a natural lanform or not.

50fa26f,"Twenty five years ago a sacecraft valled Viking 1 from NASA took a picture of what looked like a human face. Eighteen years later Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of it that was ten times larger than the last one. This photograph showed that it was nothing more than a natural land form. Some people thought that it looked this way because of clouds. Finaly in 2001 Mars Global Surveyor took a second shot at it with a much better resalution. This one also suggests that it is nothing more than a landform. Some people still think this was made by aliens despite all of the evidence going against it. I think that it is just a landform because, aliens wouldn't know what humans looked like, it isn't that unlikely, and there are other things it could be.

My first reason is that aliens would not know what humans look like. If you think about it animals on earth don't look like humans so aliens wouldn't look like that either. Mars also has really bad conditions for life like us to survive. Plus aliens woul probably look even more different than animals because they evolved on a whole other planet. It is even more unlikely that they would just guess what we look like.

Another reason is that it isn't that crazy of a coincidence. A human face is only two dots with a dot centeered under neath them and a line under it. and this doesn't even have a very distinctive nose so its just two dots and a line. Its like when you look at the clouds and see what looks like animals or other familiar things. You know aliens didn't put those there.

My last reason is that there are plenty of other things this could be. It could just be some sort of landform. Espescially in the last picture you can see lines it it resembling something that was made naturally. It is kind of like a butte or messa on earth only this is on mars. This is most likely made naturally.

The chances that this was made by aliens is incredibly low. The first picture however, does closely resemble a human's face. The problem is that with each picture it looks les and less like a human face. Also the last picture was taken on a cloudless summer day. I dont think this was built by aliens because, aliens wouldn't know what we looked like, it isn't that unlikely, and there are other explanations.",4,1,0.8478022217750549
5119498,"The ""face"" on mars was not made my aliens. We know this because it is only a Martian mesa, those are common on Cydonia. The only difference is that this one had shadows that made it look like a egyption Pharaoh. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, most of them thought otherwise. Photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyo. "" we felt it was important to taxpayers,"" says Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program.

So we photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first went on the web. Saddly enough it revealed that it was a natural landform. People were sad to see that it was not a alien moument after all, but some people still thought that it was still an alien moument.

They thought that because it was cloudy on the red planet the alien markings were hidden by haze. Neverthless, on April 8, 2001 on a couldless day the we tried for a third time, but "" its not easy work, in fact, it's hard work,"" says Garvin.""We had to role the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view.""It was not all invain we got a great shot with each pixel in 2001 spans of 1.56 meaters, compared to the 42 meters per pixel used my the Viking. The picture was so good that if there were airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyrmids, or even small shacks they could see it all.

5196465,"The face is just a natural landform. Because shadows represented human features. The face is a butte or mesa. Three pictures show that the face is just a butte or mesa and that there are no carvings or something close to it.

The face had bumps on it that created shadows to make it seem like there were human features on the mesa. The 2001 picture shows this very well you can see multiple bumps and lowered areas creating shadows. Compared to the others you would still thing aliens created it.

Three pictures accurately represent the mesa for the technology used. For 1976 it looks like a face but they could only get this as the best shot for thier time. In 1998 the picture is much more clear and you are able to see exactly what it is but with some doudt because it was cloudy that day.

The technology of 1976 was much worse then what it is now. For this specific time this picture was the best they could of shot. 1998 Was much more clear but skeptics were not happy. In 2001 they went to find a clear day that would work for finding cydonia and snapping a picture. This was clear and there werent any doudts in the picture.

Skeptics influenced the public opinion. With many skeptics giving different reasons to try and defy their research the public took thier side. This most likely happened because they want to know if there is other lifeforms. This made them want to believe that there was aliens and that this was a statue or relic of some sorts.

51e8942,"Twenty five years ago somthing happend they were in space and they found the face on mars. I am going to give you some ressons why aliens did not make the face on mars here is why. When pepole say that the face on mars was created by aliens they are wrong. The face on mars was a pictures that the vikings took from 1976. When vikings were snapping pictures of possible landing sites for its sister ship viking two. So we already know that there were pepole on mars before so they might of built the face on mars. Mission controllers had to be preparede to look agian. Then gavin said ''its not going to be a easy to target cydonia''. Althoght that few sientiste belived the face on marswas an alien artifact pictures became a priority for Nasa.

Some people might thing that aliens made the face on mars he it is why aliens did not make the face on mars. What pepole do not know abot the face on mars is that there was a picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the american west it also canbe reminded most of the snake river plain of idaho. When the viking took the picture it was 1.56 meters and when the vikings were not around no more Nasa took the picture again and it was 43 meters per pixel. Thousand of pepole gatherd to see the image first appeared on a JPL site and a natural landform. Whe they saw the picture they right away notieced that it was no alien monument after all.

These are my final ressons why. The face of mars has become very populer icon it was in hollywood film on books and magazines and also radios and grocery stores. Some people wanted to defenders of Nasabudget wish that a ancient civilzation on mars to destory the faces of mars. Few days later Nasa recived a image for all to see the caption noted a rock formation that resembles the humans head. Nasa wanted to do a surprise amoung missions controllers back at the jet propulsion lab when the face was appered on their jets propulsion lab. When Nasa got the pictures they said that about the same height as the face on mars. Whe they got a rule of tumb you could discern things in a digital image three times bigger then the pixel size. So i thing about what i told you you can know say that aliens did not create the face on mars.",2,1,0.8840779066085815
51e9c41,"Three pictures were taken of this odd feature on the land of Mars. The reasoning for the interest of the pictures is because they think the figure of the shape is a face. The first time they saw it they were astonished and had many questions that they sent other spacecrafts to take pictures two other different times. I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural formed mound and scientist need to stop listening to theories.

One reason to stop looking for a civilization is because it is not important. Mars Global Surveyor even said that finding the face is hard work itself because we dont even pass over the Face very often. We don't need to wasting our time on something that is not going to affect us here on Earth. Also, after the discovery and the first picture was taken it was just a landform not an alien momument that some people predicted or hoped to be.

Second, if you look at the pictures you see a difference in all three of them. If there was an ancient civilization wouldn't you think the pictures would be more extravagent each time after the first. What we see is the complete opposite of what was just explained. As each picture gets newer the face looks much more deteriorated than before. They face is practically gone by the third picture and there is nothing really of it to say that it was a face.

Lastly, Even if there were airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or things smaller you could see them from the cameras. So don't you think that if there were people on the planet you would also see them as well in the other three photos.

I can see where some people might be interested in the idea of there being people on another planet. It would be awesome to know that you could or can survive on another planet knowing if something happens to the one we are on now. We could even add more information on alien research NASA has been doing.

In conclusion, the Face did turn out to be a mesa and or butte. The same thing as a mesa but a lava dome and just maybe happened to be the same height as the Face on Mars. Also, the pictures you could tell it wasn't a face the dome shaped thing didn't match the features of the far away picture of the Face.          ",3,1,0.84858638048172
52032c1,"The face on Mars was not created by aliens because my three points are that the wind just made it form like that, if aliens did create they wouldn't let it get destroyed and they would keep it perfect, and so far there has been no form of life found on Mars so there nothing else could have vreated the face on Mars.

First off, there is wind on most of the planets from storms and other things like that. Wind has created many other things on Earth it has destroyed some rocks and some other things. If wind can do that on Earth I think it can also do it on Mars. The land on Mars is just creating new landforms from the wind.

Secondly, if the face is slowly being deformed the aliens would try to reform it would look like when NASA first found it. If the aliens were living on Mars they would try to keep it perfect and make it look like a human. The aliens probably wouldn't even know what a human looks like unless they have been to eath or something, so how would tjey know what a person would look like.

finally, my last point is that so far there has been no forms of life found on mars so how could aliens for the face on Mars. There have been drones like the Viking drones, that have been orbiting mars forever and they havent even found one living source on mars. If there has been a living souce, NASA would have already found it from the drones. If NASA found the life on Mars they would have already told everyoone and be on the news.

Even though, it is unlikely that the wind could have created a face that looks just like a humans face on a landform. NASA has been wishing that there was an ancient civilization on mars though. Nasa has been still lookin to see if there has been life or water or any source of living for a while though.

In conclusion, thats why there could have been no possible way the an alien has created that landform of the face on Mars, it was just the wind that created the landform.",2,1,0.8352911472320557
5204283,"NASA would like to start by saying thanks you for your interest. We find it very encouraging to see people so excited about our solar system. I am here to explain to you that, sadly, there is no life on Mars.

As previously stated, there is no evidence of life on Mars. We took a very detailed picture of Mars' surface and saw no shred of life there. When taking this high quality of a picture, you can usually discern things 3 times bigger than the pixel size. As you can blatanly see, there are no shacks, written words, or any other signs of life there.

Having discovered life on Mars' would've helped NASA in a very big way. We would have a lot more funding if we found an alien! We have no reason to mislead you. We would gladly share the existence of alien lifeforms to the rest of humanity. Sadly, there are no alien lifeforms to reveal. Now that isn't to say there won't ever be, but as of now, NASA has not found any alien lifeforms on Mars.

What we have discovered is an excellent example of Mars' geography. This is simply a beautiful mesa on the Red Planet. Although shares a striking resemblence to a face, it is just a silly illusion! It is just shadows playing on the surface, as they usually do. This is nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, this is very similar to many mesas on our planet! Although it is beautiful, it is not an alien lifeform.

I hope that this has debunked any vicious rumors you may have heard. The simple, naked truth is this, it's just a mesa. It's just a piece of land. Again, we thank you for your concern and interest. We also hope that you continue to keep informed on NASA. It really means a lot that there are still people out there who are intersted in Mars. Sincerely, NASA.",4,1,0.623401939868927

The Face has been to be called many things but its pretty clear that it is just a natural landform. If it was really made by aliens would't there be proof of actual aliens? Yeah there should be but there is no proof of aliens, so that is just more proof that the face is just a natural landform. There are many rocky parts on Mars and the face is just one of them people are over thinging it when all it is a pices of land.

Twentry- five years ago NASA's Viking 1 discovered a shadowy figuer that looked like a human face. The thing that set off the people the most was the shadowness that formed a illuison of a face. Then when the face was released to the world everyone though that it had something to do with aliens. Peolpe started to but the face in movies, magazines, make it in a book,and people would talk about it on the radio.

Very few scientist think that it was a alien which i dont think it is a alien. Then NASA sent Mars Global Surveyor to retreve more photos of the face. The pictures they retreved clearly showed that theface was just a natural landform. Think about it the pictures that were taking back in 1976 the technology wasn't great and then when they retook photos in 1998 they were so much clearer. The technology obviously inhasted over that long period of time.

But people were still not convinced so they went to take another look in 2001 and the picture was even better. People want to think aliens are real but they aren't and this so called face is has nothing to do with them. If NASA were to take more photoes of it today there would be no one who thinks its a alien. Today's technology doen't even compare to the technology they had when they took the last pictures of the face, but people are going to believe what they want.

All the facts clearly state that the face is just a natural landform. In the beginning when the face was first discovered people though it was a hard fact about aliens ,but technology got better and we could see it better to tell that it was just land. it is really clear to me that all it is a natural landform.

Few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact. Which made photographing a priority for MGS. And thats what they did.

I will also be be telling you how I know that the Face on Mars is a landform. There are many facts as to why the Face on Mars is a landform and I will be sharing all of those that I can find with you.

I will also be telling some other landforms that are similar to the Face. I am citing all of my evidence and facts from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

One of my first claims that the Face on Mars is actually a landform and was not created by aliens is from paragraph three in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and it states, ""The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

At the beginning of that sentence it says ""a huge ROCK formation"" which is telling us that it is actually rock and that it had devolped over time to form into the shape of a face. And that it was not created by aliens because aliens can not create or make rocks.

Another claim that the face is actually a land form and was not created by aliens is that in paragraph twelve is it giving us a very clear and precise meaning that the Face is an landform by telling us that, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That is telling us that there are more places in the world that are like the Face on Mars. That also means that if there are more places, then aliens could not have made the Face on Mars because that means it would have had to make all of the other mesas and buttes in the entire universe.

Lastly, my final claim that the face is actually a landform and was not created by aliens is in paragraph seven in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and that it tells us that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tem times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" At the end of that whole paragraph it tells us that there was no alien monument after all. Which means that the aliens did not create the Face on Mars at all.

In conclusion I know that the Face on Mars is actually a landform and was not created by aliens because of the facts the a have cited from the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

Conspiracy theorists feel that the Face's true reason for existence is something that NASA would rather hide. In the mean time NASA's budget defenders wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Finding such a thing would greatly benefit NASA and hel them in many ways. Therefore, if the Face really was proof of life on Mars, NASA wouldn't be hiding it, they would be announcing it for their own good.

The face on Mars has grown popularity over the idea of exterterrestrial life on mars.

Why would NASA hide anything about the face if it would fund NASA to grow and explore more, NASA has made 2 trips to identify what the face really is and both trips they ave come to the conclusion that it is a rock, There are few scientists that actually believe that it is exterterrestrial life.

Why is NASA being accused of hiding something from the public if they would benefit from discovering something that has to do with exterterrestial life? The Conspiracuy theories are ridiculous and it is completly idiodic to think that people would hide something if they wold benifit from it. NASA has also made 2 trips to prove that it is a rock foramtion on the suface and not exterrterrestrial life.

After a little time,we have found this feature on the surface of Mars to be almost the same as a butte or a mesa on Earth. Both of these land forms are found in the Western region of America. Dr. Garvin even stated,""It remind me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""and he also said,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

This common mistake was possibly because of all the conspiracy theorists. As well as Hollywood making films or book or even magazines over the image. So it's no suprise even some of us made the mistaken that it's an Alien made object. I wonder have you seen the new images of Cydonia ?That may be a reason why you thought it was created by aliens,but in the image it shows a dried up river or a small valley that placed on a hill. So,it would be best to go look at it.

Just to remind you we have a meeting at noon over the image of Cydonia... again. So don't be late.

54215a2,"""Unmasking the Face on Mars""

Unmasking the Face on Mars tells us about the face that was on Mars. Everyone think it is created by aliens.I think it is just a natural landform. I say this because in the story ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" in paragrapgh 1 it said ""When it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia"".

I feel like they just spotted the photo in just took a picture of it. Other people think it is alien movement going on up in Mars.Ithink that because in paragraph 6 it said "" ALthough few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photograpghing Cydoina bacame a priority for NASA when Mars Global Survyer (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" They are saying some of the scientists do feel like it was an alien movement.

I think some of the scientists are trying to tell other peopleit is a alien movement to. In paragraph 5 it said "" The "" Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has started in

hollywood flim, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspireacy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an civilization on Mars.

I think it is a landform because they just took pictures of it. They didnt see any type of movement. In when people are sent to out of space they would have seen aliens, but they didnt. Now people are trying to bring up all the aliens things. If we had aliens we would have known by now. So, I don't see why people are trying to say we have aliens on Mars. If there were aliens they would be in a label testing right about now. People would know. Everyone tell and say things on Facebook so it would have been going around by now. We don't have aliens. I say its just a natural landmark. They just took pictures of it.

In paragraph 7 it said "" And on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydoin for the first time, Michael and his Mar Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the oringal picture Viking photos. Thousand of anxious web surfers web site were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There was an alien monument after all."" So, they are basically saying there wasn't a alien after all.

Also in paragraph 9 it said "" In fact its hard work."" "" Mars global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks striaght down and scan the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips."" ""We just don't pass over the FAce very often,"" he noted. H is basically saying they don't go over the face very often.They went over it to prove to people it wasn't a alien movement.",4,1,0.8630455732345581
54255da,"""Hey Gary, did you read the draft of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" that NASA sent us?"" I asked my friend who I work with in editing NASA's articles. ""Yes I centainly did! And I think that the Face on Mars is clearly an alien artifact."" he replied. ""What makes you say that? There's not much evidence to prove that theory and I did not expect that from you Gary, you're such a logical person! Cleary you should think an alien made artifact is not logicly science! Right?"" I asked. ""Well... what do you think?"" Gary asked daringly. ""Sure, let me try to change your mind!"" I shot back.

""The first picture of the Face was taken in 1976 when cameras and technologys were not that advanced yet. And the article says that a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The article states that it was formed by shadows which gave the illusion of the face.

But people began to think that it was an alien sculpture. So on 1998, NASA

sent MGS to the Red Planet to take a better shot of the Face, the picture revealed a natural landform of Mars. But people like you, Gary, weren't convinced because it was winter where the Face was located so the alean markings were hidden.

Then in April 8, 2001, MGS flew to Mars on a cloudless day to get a better look at the Face. The camera the team used was a high reselution camerica, each picture spaned 1.56 meters. So if there were any alien like artifacts, it would have appeared in the picture. But it actually showed landforms that were common around western America.""

""So what do you think now?"" I asked after my speech. ""Hmmmm, maybe you're right for once. You've stated your prespective reasonably. I never expected such a logical and scientific answer from you"" He said. ""Well thank you."" I replied. ""No, thank you."" He said. ""Because of your explenation, I will think of other interesting facts differently.""",3,1,0.8227587938308716
5440f90,"On May 24,2001, something very interesting happened on Mars. About twenty five years ago a space craft took a photo of the land, that looked like a human face. This picutre was take by NASA's Viking one spaceship. It happened to be taking these photos to find places for the Viking two spacecraft to safely land. When it came arcross this uncommon sight it snapped a picture.

When the image appeared on the monitor most of NASA were surprised at the image that lied before them. Scientist soon figured out that it was just a Matian mesa. Which happened to be very common around Cydonia. Most people argue saying that this could be a sign that there use to be life on Mars.

When NASA revealed the image for everyone to see, people started to think it wasn't just another rock or land marking. People saw the face and thought aliens were found on Mars. Although, that wasn't the case. Only a few scientist thought the Face was an alien artifact. The other scientist thought it was just something like a rock that happened to look like a face, because of the shadows.

After a lot of research another spacecraft was sent to Mars on September ninteen ninty-seven. Eighteen years after the photo of the Face was taken by the Viking one. The Face was then photograph again, so that it could be examined more closely. ""On April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time,Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tentimes sharper that the original Viking photos.""

Thousands of excited people were waiting for the image. ""It first appeared on the JPL wedsite,revealing... a natural landform."" There was no sign of anything Alien about the photo. Therefore, it was not an alien aftifact after all.

Many people were unsatisfied. They claimed that since the picture of the Face was taken in a cloudy area it might explain why no one saw life in the first place. Scientist took this theory into thought. Mission controllers stated another spacecraft to send again.

On April 8,2001, it happened to be a cloudless day in Cydonia. Scientist took action. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. What the picture actually showed ""is the Martian equivalant of a butte or mesa- landforms common aroung the American West. Garvin a man who was leading this expedition says, ""'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated messa about the smae height as the Face on Mars."" There fore the face on Mars was not a sign of Alien life. ",3,1,0.8429844379425049
54765c3,"The face that you seem to see on Mars is just a big misunderstanding. Many conspiracy theorists have made up stories about this face in order to get money and popularity. Even though it is actually just a mesa in the middle of Mars, located in Cydonia. There are many mesas in the western United States and aren't made from any alien race.

This article states that the Face is,""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This illusion is what conspiracy theorists use to make it viral. It also proves how there is no face at all. It is all just a big shadow of a mesa in Cydonia.

On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Michael Malin and his team used the Mars Orbiter Camera to take photographs of the face. These photographs were ten times sharper than those of the previous Viking missions. They revealed that is was just a natural mesa and there wasn't anything to do with aliens at all.

April 8, 2001 was a day that completely changed and confirmed that there was nothing more than a mesa in Cydonia. The Mars Orbiter Surveyor can take pictures with one pixel being 1.56 meters, while the early Viking photographs had pixels that were 43 meters. This high definition camera took a picture of the face again. Being able to zoom in up to 3 times larger than the normal picture, the team found out there weren't any structures or figures on the face.

There is plenty of evidence that can prove there isn't anything wrong with the area in Cydonia. Going from high defintion photographs with modern technology to zoom in and spot out evidence or old photos showing shadows of the mesa walls. There are plenty of conspiracies that have been proven false by these photos and research of the NASA workers. This has proven that the Face on Mars was never actually a face or alien structure, but a normal everyday mesa.",3,1,0.8817062377929688
54772a9,"In the story ""Unmasking the Face in Mars"" it talks about a lanform looking like a human face.

It had eyes, a nose, and a mouth formed by shadows.

Some people believe that it was put there by aliens but somepeople believe it was a natural landform.

I belive it is a natural landform.

When they first found it they figured it was just another Martian mesa with unuasual shadows to make it look like an Egypian Pharaoh.

While conspiracy theorists believed there was an ancient civilization.

So when NASA got a chance they took another picture of the landform.

When they did they revealed that it was in fact just a natural landform.

Although NASA proved that it was a natural landform not everyone was satisfied.

They said that NASA took the picture on a cloudy day so you could not see the face through the clouds.

Then NASA took a picture with an even better camera and found that the face was a natural landform they even compared it to one on Earth.

Garvin said ""So, if there were objects un this picture like airpkanes in the or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, your could see what they were!"" So it was just a landform.

The conspiracy theorist think that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide then share.

But NASA wishes that there was a civilization on Mars and if it was then they would share it.

So NASA has all of the facts to say that is just a natural artifact and it was not created by aliens.

While conspiracy theorist do not have an real facts that aliens buit it.

So in conclusion "" The Face"" was just a natural landform that happened to look like a human face.

If it weren't for shadows to make it look like it had eyes, a nose, and a mouth it wouldn't have looked like a face at all.

Conspiracy theorist beleived that there was an ancient civilization but the have no facts to back them up.

While some say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life that NASA would rather hide. Defenders of NASA say that they wish there was an ancient civilzation. If there happened to be an acient civilzation on Mars just think about all to stuff that scientist could learn from Mars that could help describe all of the other planets.

54c9a20,"Have you ever wondered if there are any other living things in the universe? Maybe some where in a far away place, maybe on our neighbor Mars. A picture surfaced during 1976 showing what looks like a face on Mars, people were saying that it is in fact a fact of aliens on Mars, but it could also be a landform.

First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?

NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform. Plus, wouldn't we see many other things surrounding the place.

If the face was really part of an extra terestrial civilization, why would they have just a face and no other things surrounding it. Wouldn't there also be a little person or something walking around the place. Some may say that they are all inside teh face, but then shouldn't there be a visible way of entry into the place. They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.

Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",4,1,0.7965538501739502

The Face was just something formed by the planet because the artical says, ""huge rock formation... which resemles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Which means that is was just a rock that was formed a different way to look like it was a face. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but there were more scientist to prove them wrong. Another piece of evidence was when they were taking pictures Garvin said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" What the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. This evidence goes with my argument because if it was some type of alien siglnal the camera would of picked it up and they would of seen what it really was, but they didn't all they saw was a landform like the ones around American West.

In conclution it was not an alien signal, or artifact, it was just a piece of land formed differently. Now you all know it wasn't from aliens. All it was, was an illusion that looked like a real human face with a nose, eyes, and more.

To this day scientist have not encountered signs of life on any other planet. So what makes you think aliens could have created the face on Mars?

Two decades and a half ago scientist discovered a face like shape on Mars. It was about two miles long. Scientist claimed it was staring at the cameras, but there was nothing surrounding it. No power tools, or hammers, not even a few sculpting tools. How would aliens create such a thing? With alien-y tools? Magic powers maybe? No, because it was a natural formation. Scientist figured out it was just another Martian mesa, which are frequent around the Cydonia. According to the article the only thing different about this one was that it ""had unusual shawdows make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Which made people go wild.

There was dissapointment all over the place, not only for the people, but scientist too. It was a mesa, a natural landform. It was even compared to the ""MIddle Butte in the Snaler River Plain of Idaho"". Since then the popularity of the face has gone downhill.

There are many reasons why this could possibly be a landform. For example it could be like they said ""a huge rock formation."" Like on Earth the face on Mars could probably be a lava dome because if your look at the third picture at the very top it looks like it has cracks from either a river flow or it could be cracks from a lava dome.

""Big News"" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling

Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.

The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows. The (MOC) has finally released the newest picture which is 10 times sharper than any picture the Viking spacecraft could have taken, and the JPL web seach has revealed tht the face on Mars is actually just another rock formation.

Even though NASA has put the picture out there that proves that the face on Mars is not acually a face but just another land formation, there are still some skeptics out there that think taht the theory is true. Skeptics have said that perhaps since on the day the picture was taken was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet that the alien marking were hidden by the haze. NASA had come to Mars to take a picture of the face at the wrong time and if they were to come another day they might have been able to see that it was an actual face and not just some rock formation.

Around the American West there are common landforms know as butte or mesa and they are actually equivalent to the Martian. Could the butte or mesa landforms be know on other planets besides ours? We are able to get the right size because "" as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" so be comparing the actual size of the butte or mesa to right about the size of the Martian when we do the math. The land formation on earth reminds people most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho "" thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars"".

In conclusion the Face on Mars is just another regular plain old natural landform. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even a shack.""    ",4,1,0.8677127957344055
55fa29c,"The ""face"" is just another natural landform, no matter how weirdly shaped. Odd-shaped landforms can be made through wind erosion. Wind erosion can occur on any landform, and the outcome can be any shape. If it was not eroded, the planet could just have a landform different from what we have on Earth. Just because there is an oddly shaped landform on another planet does not mean that it was alien-made.

Much about Mars is undiscovered. This can mean that there are odd landforms which have not yet been discovered. Some of these landforms have the possibility of being shaped like a face or the sillouhette of one. The indentations of the ""faces"" can also be craters from meteors hitting the landforms. Because much is undiscovered, we must not jump to conclusions.

Natural landforms can take many shapes. They can range anywhere from cone-shaped to face-shaped. Just because it resembles a face does not mean it is alien-made. However, it could have been eroded to look similar to one. Many things are capable of making face-shaped landforms, not just aliens, which we are not yet sure even exist.",3,1,0.8220953941345215
560cfe8,"As a scentist who works at NASA, I claims that this Face is a natural lanform made by the Mars land. I claims that this Face is a natural landform becuase first, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. So, after taking the picture, with the best camera that exist at that time, scientist proved that the Face was a landform after all.

Secound, since the people did not believe that it's a landform. They took another picture again and Garvin says,"" It reminds me he picmost of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is just a landform on Earth. Before they took it, te picture that 1976 people took was just so blurr that they don't seem to know what it was and thought that it look like a face because of the shadow that makes the eyes, mouth, and head.

Third, the only reason that the people think it's created by an aliens is because at that time, they didn't have a better camera than we do right now. So, when the better camera took the picture, it shows that the Face was a butte or a mesa, which is a landforms common around the American West.

Someone who disagree with me says that it was an alien marking and that it

was hidden by the haze. But, here is why they are wrong. First, there is no such thing as alien. Second, 10 years of orbiting Mars, we still haven't seen alien or other life forms that came back for the "" mark.""

561e47d,"The question is: created by aliens or just a natural landform? To the uninformed citizen, their answer would most likely be that the Face is created by aliens, and that we should all prepare for Earth's destruction. However, a well trained scientist at NASA, (like me), knows that the Face on Mars is obviously a natural landform.

You might be wondering how the Face on Mars got it's features. It might seem as if it was manmade because no amount of corrosion could make it look like an ""Egyptian Pharaoh."" That answer would be half correct because even though this natural landform is not manmade, the Face's features have not been created by corrosion. Shadows simply appeared in the picture, making it seem as if it were a face of an ancient pharoah. The Face is just another Martian mesa that is commonly found around Cydonia.

Although it is important to know how the Face got it's features, it is also important to know why NASA promoted this Martian mesa as ""the Face on Mars.""

NASA decided that promoting the pictures of the Face could make the public more interested in Mars. We were correct in this sense because it definitely attracted people towards Mars and it's peculiar landform. However, we were incorrect in the idea of promoting it as a Martain mesa that had the features of a pharoah. This image confused the public, and people started believing that there were actual aliens on Mars and that these aliens had made the Face. No matter how many times scientists released research that demolished the idea of life on Mars, the public twisted the story so that it was more interesting.

Even though there was an abundance of research showing there were no aliens making the Face, NASA went out and took more pictures. These images showed that it was only a natural landform, and that there are no actual features on the Face. As I said before, the features were merely created by shadows.

Of course, people still argued that NASA was wrong. People kept saying that the ""markings"" were hid by the clouds, and that these images were simply a failure on NASA's part. This failure being that they somehow forgot to take into account that there was clouds. However, as NASA was more than careful taking these pictures, the images were as accurate as possible.

The Face on Mars may just be a hoax, but NASA's research is nothing of the sort. NASA has proven that their detailed research is used to make sure that the public is well informed. The Face may have just been a natural landform, but the public's enthusiasm for these images, (no matter how skeptical), is something that can never be recreated with shadows.

5652951,"Many people believe in conspiracy theories,that may sometimes not be backed by evidence. Some examples of this are Bigfoot or aliens. Another conspiracy theory is of the face on Mars. In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet, when it came a across something that appered to look a lot like a human face. Many conspiracy theorists believe that this landform on Mars has to do with aliens.

There is evidence that shows that the face on Mars has nothing to do with aliens. Modern technolgy has allowed us to further investigate on theories like this. ""Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" (paragraph 7). In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor was able to take a closer look. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixal size.""

With the last visit of the Face on Mars in 2001, scientists were able to get a closer look at the landform. They were able to compare the landform on Mars to the landforms here on Earth. "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". (paragraph 12). With this evidence we can tell that the landforms on Mars are simliar to the ones on Earth. Making it more likely to be caused by natural events in Mars's atmosphere.

Scientists at NASA, have enough knowledge and have done enough reshearch to differniate if events or landforms, like the Face, happen natrually or unaturally. For example,"" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" (paragraph 2). Another insistance was when NASA shared the image of the Face and the author who wrote the caption clearly explained how the landform looked like a face. ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""(paragraph 3).

As you can see people who belive in conspiracy theories, often do not have the evidence to back up that theory. The reason for these theories often come from movies and tv shows.

56a459e,"On May 24, 2001 25 years ago something wierd happend on Mars. Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars, taking pictures of landing places for its sister ship. While taking pictures the Vicking saw the shadowy likeness of a human face. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time ever. Michael Malin and and his Mars Orbiter Camera, took picturse 10 times shaper then then from the preveous Viking picture. After that they conclued that there was no alien monument after all.

On April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor came realy close for a second look. Garvin said this "" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center the Face in look."" Malins team got an really extraordinary picture of the face, by using camera's absolute maximum resoltion.

In the 2001 Viking photo its spans 1.56 meters, in 1976 Viking photo comaperd to 43 meters per pixel.

After all of the studies and looking at the picturese, what the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa. They are landforms common in West American. Its a lava dome that takes a form of a isolated mesa its about the same size and height as the face of Mars. So thats why the pictue is just a natural landform. And not alien artifact.",2,1,0.7031140327453613
56d4f26,"The Face on Mars. Many say that it was created by aliens, but I think diffrently. The Face on Mars was clearly just a miracle of nature. Over the many years that Mars has been here, it could of just be the wind and dirt forming over the rocky surface of Mars.

The Face is clearly just a huge rock formation on the surface of this planet. There is no logical reason that aliens would of made this Face. It wouldn't of been useful for a home, a shelter, or even just a explimation of life on the Red Plant. This Face represents a human face, but humans aren't capable of living in such conditions of Mars, so if it were aliens, wouldn't they created a face in the ground of a alien and not a human, have which they never seen.

With the new cameras we have today, if there where by any chance, homes, airplanes, or even pyramids on Mars, the cameras would be able to pick them out and NASA would have seen them. With saying this we can comfirmed that there is no showing of life on Mars, so the Face couldn't of been fromed by aliens.

The Face is clearly just a part of nature that was created and with our eyes we see a face. The rock formation that we see, looks like a face using the shadows from the sun, and the form of the rocky surface. With this face getting so popular, many of the conspiracy theorist are taking advantage in that and using their theroies of alien life and planting it in the minds of others. Using the Face in a movie, magazines, books, radio shows, and even in the grocery store checkout lines, the face has taken over our minds in beliving in the life of aliens.

Some people say that the Face on Mars is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, but I still believe that it's just a way of nature. ",4,1,0.8753751516342163
57581cd,"The"" ""Face"" may look like it's a human face but it's not. Anything can make anything look drastic or cool. But there is no way that it could be a human inside of Mars. It's way to sketchy for it to be like that. So I'm gonna go ahead and tell you why I think this is why I don't think it is a human at all.

The face structure hasn't changed any of those pictures. If it was human, in a couple of months or years (maybe), your body becomes rotton and turn into nun but bones. If it was human, then it would have body parts along side with it. There's no body parts near it except rocks and holes. Besides, the picture look like it was taking from a pretty far distance for the head is bigger then that boulder next to it.

The fact that I know that it's not a face, notice how by years go by, the face starts looking like an sand temple. The thing with it is that on the top of it, it looks like another face on it, like a rebuilded electronic robot. But, when 2001 came by, it started looking like an a map or a super hard shell. All of these things that were on Mars looks different by the years. Now, in 2016, I bet it looks like a guided map to wear it started to wear it landed at.

There's no doubt that this is just some random structure because there were no oxygen, nor water, on mars, in 1976. It's pretty much impossible to live there unless, your from NASA. Then again, there still are rumors about alien's existing. So what if there was a alien who killed an human and left it there? If you notice now, the structure of the ""Face"", how it fades away, it starts looking like an cracked shell.

I want to believe that there is life on Mars, but the thing is that Mars ""probably"" have alien's there. As no one has thought about it, alien's could be legit. Just because we see a face on Mars means one thing, but the fact that it's whole entire bottom half of it's neck-to-bottom part is gone. Just because it changed up doesn't mean,""Oh, it must have cleared up since it's been there for a while"". I doubt that because, no human being can walk on Mars with no protection on that can keep him/her alive. If your going to Mars, make sure you need a quite bit of protection. But, if you actually do see an alien, just run, because it's best staying alive instead of wind up dead in the middle of no were on Mars.",2,1,0.7904231548309326

57797cd,"While the Face on Mars does look like a face, there is no way possible that it could be an alien artifact. Research, advance in technology, quotes from scientists, and actual evidence proves that this is just a natural landform on Mars. Mars has had plenty of speculation on this, yet all the answers have come back that it is impossible. No, there is not a lot of evidence, but there is enough to show that this is just a mesa.

When scientist first found the Face, it was already speculated to be a mesa. This was because of the place where it was located, Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having many mesas in its area. This one just happened to have shadows on it appearing like a face. Let us not forget that the Face was found in 1978. That is when space travel was still a new for the world. Technology was not that advanced as it is today. The last picture was taken in 2001, which was twenty years later after the first photograph was taken. Spacecraft and photos had improved twice as much.

Even though technology has improved we still cannot tell whether it is an alien or not. We must go off of facts. Scientist Jim Garvin stated that,""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, id there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could not see what they were!"" This shows that the Face could not even of been seen. So, it is impossible that it was an alien artifact.

Mesas and buttes are very common on Mars. Especially in Cydonia. Technology has improved and there is no way we could see a face from that size. ""That's a lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars,"" said Garvin.

They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degress to center the face in the field of view,each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1,56 meter,compared to 43 per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.If there were objects in the picture like an airplane on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramides or even small shacks,you could see what they were!There for there is no evidence of a alien anywhere.

Researcher think that it is forming something that forming from the planet nothing else not aliens or anything because they have not left anything there and if they where forming it we would know because the images would show someting or some king of evidence.I think that it is something to show that there will be lfe on Mars and the planet is suddenly forming something that will keep us living and we have air and water to drink and to have a way of building thing.

Mars could be forming by Aliens because it could be there sign to have humans come to their planet and it could be safe we don't know.We have to find something that is going to prove to us whatever is forming this could be a god thing or a bad thing.NASA thinks that it is something that is forming that is going to bring life to the plant,They believe that its going to help but it could be Aliens trying to put us in danger.When we get evidence of something true then we will have the real answer to what we need .

Right now I think that it is something that i just forming onto the planet that is going to bring air that we can breath and water that we can drink I think that the face is a sign that scienctist need to go over there and try something new or find out some more imfromation about everything that is going on.The people that have put in work thinking it is aliens there is no prove of that and untill we do don't think that.Its a sign that one day there will be life on Mar's.

It is an natural landform because the sensational was a short live. We decieded as scientist it was just anther Martian mesa. The ""Face on Mars"" has been a pop icon. That is half of the reason why it is a natual landform also.

A few of scientists belived the Face was an alien artifact. Then they felt this was an improtnt to taxpapers. After everybody had found that out everybody then thought this was an good Natural Landform.

Everyne was not satistfied. Some people only thought of the Natural Landform as something else but others just dont agree with it. The face is an Natual landform. We just don't pass over the face very often. The landforms common around the American West it just dosen't come as often.

The Scientist think that if the Natural Landform of the Face do come around often more people will maybe belive in it. The Lava dome take the form an isloate mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars do.

First of all I think this because, there is no evidence. No evidence has been found to suggust that there were aliens who built the face. The only thing you can find on aliens are in newspapers or on tv and they are based on pure opions instead of facts.

Secondly I think this because there are things on earth that may look like a face but isnt one. There are many landforms that may resembel a face but were proven to be naturaly formed.

Lastly, I think this because we have digitaly made the image 3 times bigger and found no objects in the picture. So if there were objects in the picture we would have been able to see them. This supports the idea that ther is no life on Mars to create the face.

While some people say that this is definetly alien activity, they have been proven wrong. In the 2001 photo, the great pixels showed that this was nothing more than a mesa with weird shadows. There wasn't even anything around it. There were no planes houses nothing just a big lump of rock.

This kind of mesa can be found on Earth too. There are a lot in the U.S.A. one especilly good one is a lava dome in Idaho. Even though this mesa on Mars is not lava it is a rock that looks like natural earthly structures.

Back then nobody was positive that it wasn't aliens that had built a really big sculpture, but as tecnology got better, NASA was able to say for sure that this odd thing on Mars was not aliens. Only a big mesa that was isolated on the Red Planet.",3,1,0.8814718723297119
58969ec,"Do you guys belive in aliens? Well,I got a friend over at NASA who does. And I'm here to tell you all about the Face on Mars. You know,the one that's been all over books and magazines for like the past 25 years. A lot of people think it was created by aliens,but I don't. Let me tell you why.

My first piece of evidence to put an end to this ludacrisy is that in April of 1998,Mars Global Surveyor flew over the an area of the Mars where the Face was spotted,Cydonia. Michael Malin and his orbit camera team took a picture of the face that was ten times sharper than the original photo from 1976. The picture,to everyones suprise but mine,revealed that there was no alien monument. The picture only showed a natural landform. However the phot was taken during a cloudy time of the year on Mars.

So,on April 8,2001 another photo was taken. This time a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Mars Global Surveyor used a camera that had each pixel span 1.56 meters. So even if the picture had a plane on it or small shacks,you could still see it. When the photo was taken it shows the Martian that resembles American lamdforms called buttes and messas. It even reminded a scientist of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

So I hope this can put away any ridiculous ideas about the Face being created by ""aliens"". This is all proof that what was thought to have been something mythical,was actually just a landform on Mars! Aliens do not exist. It's just that simple.",3,1,0.8323305249214172
5897e71,"The Face showing on Mars has been proved to be a natural landform. The Face is a landform because landforms are very common in Cydonia, the only reason the landform looked like a face was because of the shadows visible from the camera, and there was no other evidence found around the face. Also all research for the Face was done by authorized NASA scientists, and the research was believed to be done very carefully.

In Cydonia it is common to have natural landforms, so the Face was easy to be spotted as one. And as the cameras took pictures from different angles, the scientists could see it wasn't anything that spectacular. What made the Face so intresting and made people have false accusations was what made the Face an actual ""face"".

The reason that this lanform resembled a face was because of the shadows. There was shadows on the landform that resembled a head, eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Scientists even stated that the Face ""looked like an Egyptian Pharoah"".

Even if the Face was found to look like something that was a living thing does not have an effect on the research that had been completed on this landform.

To make this statement that the Face is in fact a landform is the amounts of research done by NASA scientists. From snapping numerous pictures to keep resuming to study the Face, NASA has had many ways to prove their point. And after placing the first image on a JPL website, it was settled for most people- the once known as ""Face"" was a natural landform. It was no sign of Aliens or an Alien monument anywhere to be seen on Mars.

And the last statement to be concluded about this discussion is that there was nothing else found near the Face to thinking there is any living activity on Mars. NASA has also concluded from the pictures that there had been no objects in the picture like ""airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks..."" So there had been no activity to prove to be nothing more from just a landform.

In the picture of the Face, it was also evidenced to resemble a mesa or a butte, another kind of natural landform. These kinds of natural landforms were even almost the same height as the Face on Mars. And all of this evidence proved that what used to be thought of as a real face is now catagorized as a natural landform with some shadows that gives it unique look.       ",4,1,0.8859240412712097

So, in conclusion, the famous face on Mars was a natural landform. This is supported by the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001. The image captured in 2001 could also possibly see other objects if there were any. So, the face not a sign of life on Mars.",3,1,0.9115122556686401

Like i said if an alien did this we would have know by now. In various researches they have said and wrote that this is a natural cause. I actually do have prof and evidence about my opinion. On April 5,1998 they took a picture, it was ten times sharper than other pictures they took in the past. Although I get it that lots of people want it to be true that an alien did that, but with what prof?

I also see why you all think this. Many of you think that there are alien markings hidden by haze.

After NASA shared with the world their images of the ""Face on Mars,"" conspiracy theorists were excited that it was an alien monument. And why do you think they were? Because they had never seen anything from an alien civilization before. The text states that ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" said Jim Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This proves that the face was not an early martian civilization.

The images also show a resemblance of a butte or mesa, which are landforms found on Earth, and Earth does not have aliens here. If they are natural landforms found on Earth, then why are there ones just like them on Mars? Earth and Mars are very similar planets, so they most likely form on both.

Some people believe, however, that this was actually an alien creation. The Face on Mars is just a landform because it looks similar to landforms on Earth, only at certain angles does it look like a face, and high quality pictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform.

The Face on Mars is similar to landforms here on Earth. One scientist, Garvin, states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" (12). Only at certain angles does the landform look like a face. The author of the article states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face"" (8). High quality ppictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform.

The reasons that the Face on Mars is just another landform are that it looks like landforms on Earth, only certain angles show the Face, and high quality photos of the Face prove that fact. conspiracy theories are wrong because they don't have any facts to back up that this could be created by aliens.

Also don't you think that if it were created by aliens we'd have more proof? All we have is a weird shaped landform? That's all we have and we see them all the time. Erosion that's what made your face on Mars.

5967002,"The Face on Mars is not an alien creation. It is a natural landform. Evidence to support this claim includes: this landform is similar to ones found on Earth that were created naturally, the technology is extremely advanced to where we would know if alien life existed, and NASA would share any evidence of life on Mars if any is found.

The Face on Mars is much like natural landforms found here on Earth, specifically in the western part of North America. It is called a mesa. In the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Because the atmospheres and climates of Earth and Mars are similar, it is very possible that the same type of natural landforms could be created on both planets. There has even been evidence supporting the claim that water previously existed on Mars, which could have caused erosion that formed the Face.

Technology has improved drastically within the last few decades. Specific to this research, cameras are part of that new and improved technology. NASA was able to capture outstanding photographs of the Face. It is stated in the article, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" With these sharper images, the Face no longer looked like a face. The conditions were different as well. On a cloudless day, Mars Global Surveyor captured more images of the Face. It looked like an ordinary landform.

There has never been any solid official evidence of life on the Red Planet. People think NASA may be hiding their findings of aliens on Mars. However, in paragraph five of the article, it says, ""... evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" NASA would definetly share any evidence of alien life with the public because that would be great publicity for them. It would be huge news that would spread across the world. NASA would benifit greatly from this because of all the money it would bring in.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not an alien formation, but a natural landform that happened to resemble a human face at one point. Some people will continue to believe that aliens do exist, but as of right now, no solid evidence has proven that theory. These are just a few reasons that support the Face as being a landform that was created naturally, but NASA has many more. As more technology is developed and NASA delves deeper into uncovering the secrets of Mars, we will anxiously await any new discoveries. ",5,1,0.8782538175582886
596bc3d,"Ther are 3 main supportive reassons why this ""face on mars"" is just a natral landform. One, there is a posibility that the face is just a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth""-paragraph 3. Two, if the face on mars was evidence of life on mars that would be ''evedence that NASA would rather hide""-paragraph 5. Three, paragraph 12 explains that the face on mars is equivalent to a butte or mesa.

First of all there is a posibility that the face is just a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth""-paragraph 3. I believe this beacuse NASA does not come across it veary often. Therefore, every time NASA did see the face then they might of just cought the rock formation at the right time, therefore cetching the right light. In a better picture taken in 1976 by Viking 1 you can clearly see shadows wich might be the scource of the face formation.

Second if the face on mars was evidence of life on mars that would be ''evedence that NASA would rather hide""-paragraph 5. I think this very much makes sence because if it were evidence that would be somthing surely to keep out of the media. If there were other evidence of life on mars then why would NASA let just one piece of evidence out if it could easaly be mistaken. Then you would have a fake story going around that could possibly spark tension between countries for lieing about life on mars.

Third, paragraph 12 explains that the face on mars is equivalent to a butte or mesa. A butte is a lava bome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Therefore creating a figure that, with the right light, will creat a face loking feature. Also since a better picture was taken it would be easeier to ""discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"". ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""-paragraph 11

5987254,"Every theory needs to have proof, or else no one will want to believe the idea. Theorys though, are just ideas or thoughts people have. Its hard to link a day dream to scientific facts. The statement that the Face was created by aliens is nonsense. There are no facts to back the idea up. Aliens haven't even been proved to be real! People need to understand that the Face is just a mesa, a type of landform that be found on Earth aswell.

If the aliens were real, don't you think something would have changed by now? There is absolutley no sign of any life near the mesa; not even on the planet. If the aliens did exist then we should have noticed some sign. The statement that the Face is only a landform is clearly correct, unlike the idea that creatures formed it into Mars.

The statement that the Face is just a mesa has lots of proof to back it up. There are many sets of pictures, including the pictures from the original Viking itself. The Viking was the spaceship on Mars that helped capture the landform on camera. There are also pictures from recent explorations that further prove that the Face is just a landform.

I think one of the reasons people like to dream up conspiracys is because of the other ideas spread by celebritys. People like talk show hosts spread there ideas for large groups of people to hear, causing people to further think on those ideas. Plus the movie that was made about the Face doesn't help by mixing the facts up. If I were to give you one piece of advice it would be to stick to the facts. Late night dreams won't get you far in a lab or other place of scientific study. The Face is just a landform, nothing more, nothing less.",3,1,0.8145219087600708
599e45f,"The face is simply a landform that ended up looking as if it were a face. If it were to be an actual face, I'm positive that the texture of the rock face wouldn't feel like it is made of rock. The face would decay and what would be left would be nothing but bones. The odds of finding an Egyptian Pharaoh's head on Mars is highly unlikely, or if there's any odds of that even happening at all.

In paragraph one, it states that the face is nearly two miles from end to end. If this were to be an Egyptian Pharaoh's face, it would have to travel all the way from Earth to Mars. How would the face even be put into space in the ancient Egyptian time period? Again, highly unlikely that a face traveled millions of miles through space and appeared on the surface of Mars. Just looking at the picture below paragraph five makes me want to believe that the face is really a face rather than a natural landform. The significant detail and shape of the face is so human like that it's hard to believe that is was naturally created over time. For example, the Washington Monument was hand carved with pick axes and with the use of dynamite. The detail is much more significant than the Mar's face, but yet how nature created it, I don't know and I don't quite understand how this was done. Considering this is two miles big also makes me wonder if this did come from outer space; the face's impact of hitting the crust of Mar's would ruin the structure of the face. The thought also of the face being made by craters hitting the face also doesn't quite make any sense. Could NASA possibly have made this up? People at NASA are very intellectual as they could maybe trick the world into believing that the formation of a human face on Mar's really happened. The odds of it being a natural landform is hard to believe, but also the thought of aliens creating the face is also highly unlikely.

In paragraph two, it states that scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia, but somehow turned out looking as if it were an ancient Egyptian Pharoah's face. How this happened, nobody knows, but in my opinion, this is just a very odd coincidence. Maybe someone outside of Earth carved this? As people even have believed that aliens were the creators of the masterpiece. Nobody will ever know but it is sure that the face isn't an actual Pharaoh face like people hypothesized it was.

From reading the article, it seems as if NASA used the gossip about the face to try and make money off of the coincidential face that appeared on Mars. At the end of paragraph five, it states that, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Why might they wish there was an ancient civilzation on Mars? Simply so that NASA's discovery could make them millions of dollars. NASA bringing in the word alien is just dumb in the first place. Are you serious? We haven't even found one thing about aliens existing and you try and tell the public that aliens made this? NASA's purpose of the face in my opinion is for the money.

The idea that the face is bona fide evidence on Mars makes sense, maybe the people on Mars were giants with two miles wide faces? From only seeing pictures, there isn't evidence of anything, we can only state what we believed happened for a face to appear on the crust of Mars surface. As many people believe multiple different hypothesis, we need to do more research to see if there is any faces buried in Mars just like the one we discovered. More evidence that there is possibly life on Mars being similar to the face found would make people really believe that life outside of Earth is possible. We as people could believe that the face is really a Egyptian Pharaoh's face, or a natural landform created by either craters, erosion, or the face possibly being relocated and reaching Mars. As already being stated, we need more evidence of this being a real face. If this is really a face then there would have to be other pieces of the rest of the body somewhere, or more faces in Mars below the surface. The coincidence of a Pharaoh's face appearing on Mars is almost impossible, considering that Pharaohs were people that weren't exactly giants as a two mile wide head would demonstrate. Up close picutres of the face showing if there is possibly more detail than what is shown in the picutres provided would help the fact that this is actually an ancient Egyptian face. There is no way to prove this other than finding other evidence of faces so that this coincidence doesn't seem so much like a coincidence. Being created by aliens would be hard to prove, also using you're common sense that we have yet to find anything even close to the fact that aliens exist. We would first have to prove aliens are real, then somehow prove that aliens came to Mars, carved this face, then left without doing anything else. The chance of aliens carving out this face is also very highly unlikely, in my opinion there is no chance of aliens carving out a human face on Mars. ",4,1,0.7010420560836792
59e7f71,"Is the face on Mars an alien artifact of just a natural landform? So far we have no real proof that aliens even exist. Also in 1998 the JPL website revealed that it was just a natural landform and not made by aliens. Also NASA would be just as excited to reveal that another life form has been found, that wouldn't be a kept secret.

So far we have no real proof that aliens exist. If there were aliens wouldn't we know by now? There are lots of alien conspiracies but nothing that proves aliens exist. UFO spottings are just the same. You may think theres an alien in there but whos to say its not just a flying frisbee. And the crop circles how do you know the farmer doesn't just like to have a nice looking crop.

Lots of people believe in aliens but what are they basing these beliefs from, one blurry picture? We can say there may be evidence of aliens but no proof.

When the next Mars Global Surveyor flew over we got an even better picture. Lots of people were anxious to find out what the story behind this face was. Later theJPL website revealed something that shocked, relieved, saddened, and angered the people. The website had said that there was no alien artifact just a natural land form. How after all of that can you still think there are aliens? Well some people still believe. There are all kinds of things people think that show us there are aliens. But just about every one of them is some kind of misunderstanding.

If we had found aliens we would be eager to share our discovery not try to hide it. People say that NASA is just trying to make us think there are no aliens. The truth is we wish we had found them. It would have been much more exciting to find aliens than some sort of natural landform. Some people think that this is evidence that we are trying to hide our discoveries. I really do wish that we had found aliens. Talk about a pay raise! But, there is still no strong evidence of aliens.

I think by now it is safe to say that aliens don't exist. So far we just have no real proof of aliens. Not to mention that JPL already confirmed that the face was just a natural landform. Also theres that part about how we would benifit even more for finding aliens. People can still have their conspiracies but that can't change the facts. THERE ARE NO ALIENS! ",4,1,0.8096139430999756
5a68bcb,"To many people, the Face is not an alien made landform. NASA has done plenty of research to find out what the Face was, and their research does not lead to that. The people who do think that this is an alien made landform have not done as much of the research to figure it out, since they do not have the same high technology equiptment that NASA has. Many people think that the Face was made by aliens, but I believe that it is naturally formed, and it just happens to look like a face.

There is no real evidence stating that aliens are real, or that they have ever existed. There has been research done, but no clear evidence that they are real, leading to the conclusion that most people think that they are not real. The Face, to some researchers, looks like what is similar to a mesa or butte. This is a natural landform that looks like a landform you would typically find around the American West. The differences in the pictures over the years help explain why the Face is not alien made.

The pictures over the years change gerastically. In 1976, the picture is pretty blurry, looks smooth, and almost resembles a face on a statue. In 1998, the picture looks a little more like itself, a little rougher, and it does not resemble a face as much as the first picture. Lastly, the picture in 2001 looks more like a landform and is a little rough, but it is a much clearer picture than the other two. The last picture still resembles a face almost, but I believe that that is just a coincidence. NASA did plenty of research on the Face.

NASA has done a lot of research on the Face to prove if there is life on Mars or not. The Face was found by one of NASA's spacecrafts called the Viking 1, which was taking pictures of possible landing spots for the other spacecraft, Viking 2. They let the picture out to the public, which got really popular really fast. The Face was really popular for 25 years! After those 25 years, they decided to get a better picture of the face. The picture turned out to be ten times sharper than the original photos. The pictures showed that the photo was a landform. Some of the scientists were not satisfied, and had to get a better photo, which still showed that the Face was just a landform.

The Face was a natural landform on Mars that happened to look like a face. Although many believe that it was created by aliens, the evidence shows that it is just a landform. The three pictures that were taken help compare and tell us why it was not alien made. There is no evidence stating that aliens are real, so it is not a valid conclusion to state that aliens created the landform. The evidence shows that the Face is, in fact, just a landform which coincidentally looks like a face.   ",4,1,0.8077150583267212
5a6ac21,"The face on Mars, some people think it's an object created by aliens, others believe the face is just a natural landform. Many people think it was made by aliens because it looks similiar to a real person's face. Many other people think it's just a natural landform because aliens don't exist. The face on mars, is it an object made my aliens or just a natural landform?

First of all, as myself being a NASA scientist, I believe it's a natural landform. I think it's a natural landform because there has been no evidence of life on Mars. NASA took a picture of the landform with a camera that can make the image three times bigger. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small rocks, you could see what they were""(11)! Also it could be a natural landform because in Idaho there is a natural landform that looks similair to the one on Mars. If it was an object made by aliens us scientist's at NASA would be able to know.

On the other hand, many people think it's an object that was created by aliens. Many people think that because its so similair to a person's face. The face on Mars is located at a place where it is usualy cloudy, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze""(8). Skeptics think that NASA didn't see the aliens in the pictures because they were hidden in the fog or haze. They also think ""the FACE is bona fide evidence of life on Mars""(5).

Also the face on Mars is a pop icon. When NASA released the pictures many people whent crazy about the face. ""It has starred in a Hollywold film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years""(5)! This shows us that people are excited and what to know about the face on Mars.

In conclusion, we will never know if the face on Mars was created by aliens, or just a natural landform. There are many facts on why its not a landform made by aliens, but many peopole still believe it was made by aliens. Whatever the face is, it will always be something everyone will remember.",3,1,0.8590672016143799
5a730aa,"When NASA found the Face on Mars, conspiracy theorists were sure that it was created by aliens. NASA did research and found out that the face was not what everyone thought it was. NASA found that the Face was just a natural landform. NASA knows that it is a natural landform because they took a close picture of it, and we have natural landforms just like it on Earth.

Lots of people thought that the Face on Mars was bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Those people say that NASA would hide information like life on Mars from the public instead of telling the truth. Even after being shown evidence, the skeptics were not satisfied. They said that the alien markings may have been hidden by the haze on that day.

When NASA took a picture ten times sharper than the original picture, it revealed that the Face was just a natural landform, not an alien monument. The picture shows that it is Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The landform is quite similar to landforms on Earth around the American west. The skeptics still didn't believe NASA. To satisfy the skeptics NASA took another picture with maximum resolution on a cloudless summer day. It again showed that the Face is only a natural landform.

The Face turned out to be just a natural landform afterall. Although skeptics believed that there was something that NASA wasn't telling us about the Face, NASA had proof that it was a natural landform. We know that the Face is a natural landform because we have landforms just like it on Earth and we have proof with pictures.

If you think that the face is an evidence that theres life on Mars, then think about how they got there and how advance their technology would have to be. The face is just a natural landform because on paragraph 12 it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,12).

You may think that it is evidence that life exist on Mars. I respect that. You got some good evidence, some scienctists even believe that too. That the face is an alien artifact. ""Althought few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,6). I'm not gonna lie, it does look like a face to me too.

Althought it may look like a face, alien artifact , or the face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. You still have to get cold hard facts. Some facts like, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,2).It was even unveiled as "" Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose , and mouth""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,3).

5a89201,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it talks about the face on Mars and how it was put there. Three ways scientists have concluded, is that there was once life on Mars and the face is from Aliens that once lived there. Others think it was hit by a huge rock and where it got hit it left an identation that just looks like a face. Or that the Face is just something that formed there naturally but to the human eye it looks like a face.

In my opionion I believe the face was put there by a rock or it just formed naturally and that there was no aliens on Mars. I say this because rock formations happen all the time along with rocks bumping into planets causing indentations on planets. Even most scientists believe it was not put there by an alien like in paragraph 6 of the article it says, ""Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" I also believe that the face was put there by either a rock or just formed there by itself because if it was put there by a alien how have we not ever seen any of the aliens there on Mars or around Mars not only recently but ever? Or how have we not found any other artifacts left behind by aliens?

So in conculsion all of the information I have read in this article show me that any of the theories could be true but I still believe that the Face is just an identation on Mars left from a rock collesion or just formed there naturally. Especially since we do not have any other artifacts of it being put there by a alien or another living thing.",2,1,0.8644163608551025
5a93b8e,"The human face on Mars was not created by aliens. I know that because it changes over time. And the aliens wouldn't know what humans looked like they would have had to guess what we looked like. And another reasons is that if they did make it someone probably would have seen them create it. They would have to be like invisible for us not to catch them making it or doing somthing eles. That is why it couldn't have been aliens who made it

If aliens were real they would have to know what we look like and in order to see us they would need to get close to earth. If they did get close to earth we would probably see or notice them. Or they could have seen us on the moon but in order to do that they would either have to be able to see through the glass or they would need to go in the spaceship. But they are probably more scared of us than we are of it so why in the world would they have made a sculpure of us if they are more scared of us than we are of it.

Even if aliens did make the face on the moon they would have to have a way of making it and they probably aren't like you see on the tv or somthing. We probably would have seen them if they did make it bacause thay would have had to frist have the tool and it would have tacken a long time. It shows in the pictures that they are still modifing it so they would have to be like invisible to dodge all of our space crafts and rovers and stuff. Even if they still made it then they are probably more scared of us than we are of them. So if they were so scared of us than why in the world would they make a sculture of someone they fear ,and that they know wold hurt them.

Now you know that aliens could have in no way made that face on mars. the reasons that aliens couldn't have made them are, they would have been seen they are too scared, they are still modifing it, they dont know what we look like, and they may have seen us but through a spacesuit.

5ab9d2e,"40 years ago, on mars, NASA caught a picture of a huge rock formation that looked like a face! Many thought it was evidence of life on mars while scientist thought it was just another a natural landform. After all it was just a natural landform that was shaped like a face and shadows that made the eyes, nose, and mouth.

First, Scientist just figured that it was just another Martian mesa, common around cydonia, but the only thing that was unusual was that the shadows made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But, beside the shadows they still believe it is a natural land form. So they reveiled they photo for the world to see how cool it is.

But, It was taken the wrong way. Even though the said it was natural landforms, others believed it was life on mars. It became popular quickly. It was in books, magazines and even Hollywood films. Since everyone thought it was life on Mars scientist had to prove them selfs and take it one step closer.

Next, scientist had to go up in Space with Mars Global Surveyor to photograph Cydonia. On April 5, 1998 the Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Carmera snapped a picture the best they could. Jim Garvin said"" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a shot."" After looking at the photo, JPL website revealed that....it was just a natural landform.

However, that did not stop the people who believed that it was a sign of life on Mars. They said "" the Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98."" Since it was cloudy around that time of year maybe you couldn't see all the alien markings because they were hidden by the clouds.

Then, Scientist decided to take a better picture with no interuptions or anything in the way. So, on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia in 2001,The Surveyor captured an amazing photo. ""Malin""s team captured an extradorinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" said Garvin. ""Each pixle in the 2001 image spans to 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meter per pixle in the best 1976 Viking photo.""(Unmasking the Face on Mars)

In conculsion, The face on Mars is a natural landform. Scientist took 3 photos to prove it. Others may still believe that the face is life on Mars, but scientist have proven it is just another natural landform on Mars.                        ",4,1,0.8735545873641968

The ""Face"" is just a landform. How do we know this? Take a long look at the picture taken of it in 1976, seems alittle blurry to tell what it is. Then take a look at the picture taken of it in 1998, as you can see, it's NOT a face. Still not convinced? Look at the picture taken in 2001, the camera used had a

high-resolution lense. Go ahead and sneak a peak. It's no face.

In fact, the ""Face on Mars"" just looks like a LANDFORM in the 2001 picture. Clearly, it's not a face. Some scientists believe that it is fact an alien artifact, but not everyone aggrees with their opinion on it. Yes, there could be life on Mars, but it's a slim chance. There's barely any water there, but what water is there is frozen, suggesting that life may have existed there in the past.

The ""Face on Mars"" has been argued over for the last twenty-five years! People, please! Twenty-five years is long enough! In addition to that, some of the people who believe that aliens created the ""face"", believe that NASA is hiding it from the public! NASA would actually BENIFIT from finding evidence of life on another planet.

Yes, the landform has some shadows that resemble eyes, a nose, and mouth. People, please just think for a moment. Why would an alien race create a face-like structure on the surface of Mars? What would the purpose of it be? How would it benifit them in building it? Why would they ONLY build a face structure? Why not build a body for it? Face it people, it's a natural landform.

5acd760,"Have you heard of the photo taken in 2001 that revealed a strange, unusual, ""Face on Mars?"" In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars in search for a landing spot for its sister ship. During the look for a site, the spacecraft noticed something that resembled a human face. This discovery brought up a huge debate between other NASA scientist and conspiracy theorists. The people thought that the Face was a confirmation of life on Mars, but we scientist can ensure you that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa.

The Face on Mars was discovered on a red planet called Cydonia. When Jet Propulsion Lab seen the photographs captured by the NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, they figured that it was just another Martain mesa. Jet Propulsion Lab came to the conclusion that it was just a mesa because in the text it states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia..."" From this the reader can infer that mesas are often found on this planet. Not only did Jet Proplusion Lab believe it was just a natural landform, Mars Global Suveyor also believed it was created naturally.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument after all. The spacecraft flew over Cydonia and also captured a picture of the pop icon, the Face on Mars,. The Mars Global Surveyor took a photograph, but ten times sharper than the original photograph from NASA's Viking photos. This picture sure proved that there were no alien monuments. However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly. Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa.

Mission controllers from Mars Global Surveyor prepared to take another look at the Face on Mars. On April 8, 2001, the spacecraft flew over Cydonia again and captured a photo as clear as day. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" This photograph showed that the Face on Mars is equivalent to landforms found around the American West.

In conclusion, the picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa. I believe that this was an amazing discovery and gave us, NASA scientist, a challenge to go out and find evidence to prove conspiracy theorists's accustuations. ",5,1,0.8833337426185608

However, aliens did not create the face on mars. The face was a natural landform, scientists did tons of research on this face. At first the scientists thought the face on mars was just another Martian mesa. Once this face was captured on camera a few days later NASA revealed the face they took a picture of on mars. The face then was starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines and even radio talk shows.

When the scientists were researching the face on mars, like i said they thought it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Which is when everyone starts amking these assuptions and even make it look belivable that aliens could have possible made the ""face on mars"".

It is stated in the article that the ""face"" does not actually have eyes or a nose, that it was just the shadows that made them. scientists proved that it was not a face by takeing another more clear image of the ""face"", showing that it was a land formation and not an alien. They also proved that there were no alien pyramids, shacks, or any alien artifacts near the rock formation.

The Face is just a natural land form because NASA has not identified who could have done it,they only have images and the Face is in the ground whickh makes it a land form.

NASA does not see these faces all the time. Why is this ""landfrom"" one of a kind? Mars has been a planet for years and only has one Face. Which proves that, aliens could have created this. Maybe it is a self portrait, or a sign. The picture of the face was first taken on April 5, 1998. This gives the aliens plenty of times to create the face. On Mar the landforms are remotly the same because of the climate effects everything in a similar way.

NASA believes aliens are real. If NASA has found evidence that aliens may be real, then why don't they think aliens created this? Aliens could be capable of doing this. The Face could be an alien artifact. Maybe there are more underground built by aliens that you can not see.

This is a landform because NASA only has images. Images cn be deciving , I know from experience. This may look like a face, but is not. Sometimes things are not what they seem. In 2001 they had image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 metere per pixel in 1976.

The Face is in the ground. Being attched to the ground, not made by man is a land form. An alien is not a man even if the face is man created. It is simplily just a landform that looks like something that it is not. On Mars there are other land forms, but they just don't look like a face. The lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the Face on Mars. This is not made made which makes it a lanform.

NASA has not identifed who could've made the Face. If NASA takes pictures of Mars then they should have pictures of the ""makers"". Therofore this is a landform or else they would have a picture of who could've created the Face .The Face is located at 41 degree angl north martin latitude. No prof of anyone making it.

The face on mars is just a lndform because of the pictures we took we could not see and form of building structure. one thing that brings me to this conclusion is the rocks and shadows made it look and seem very real. The text states ""...formed by shadows..."". Tv and other things are what is drawing the attention to the matter andthey are whats broadcasting to the world that it is real. The text states "" It starred in a hollywood film , appeared in books , magazines, radio talk shows...""

This dosn't necasarily mean anything though. Then they took an other picture of the so called face on mars in 1998 it came in clearer now becouse we had created new technolgy that lets us take better pictures. Then finally as techonolgy as we know it has become greater it takes better pictures now so in 2001 N.A.S.A took an other photo of the mysterios face. It turns out its not even a face it was just a land form.

With the new technology there was no dobt it was just a landform ""so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they are!"" As stated in paragraph 11. It is just a landform like land forms we have on our planet we have the grand canyon for instance it just so happens mars has some landforms of its own and it just happens to be a landform clasified as a mesa landform common in part of the american west. So dont let hollywood get to you with there myths and spooky tales the real evidence prooves its just a land form.

It is fun though to dream of it as a sing there is other life beyond us but for right now it is just a landform on mars. If your still not conviced let me explain more the reason that we had not came across the landform as soon as we had discovered mars is becouse we don't cover that area that often but it is shurley not aliens. Look at the time capsale at the beginning of the arcticle from 1976 to 2001 it clarifies more so you can see the image better it just is a peice of land perhaps the image that was taken was just clouds casting a shadow that made it apear as a face. I hope i have cleared any thoughts you have had other wise about this so now yo know it is just a simple lanform that was once dreamed as a face.",3,1,0.7860887050628662
5c90619,"My opinion is that i think there are no other life forms on any planet but planet Earth. I also think it's just an natural landform.

In 1976, the technolohy wasn't good, so you could be staring at any thing from that photo. In the artical it says ""few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact"". Those scientists did a lot of research on that photo so if they say its not an alien artifact i believe them.

In 1998, when the MGS took another photo of the ""Face"" . You can see there is no face on the planet is wasn't an alien monument on it. It is just a natural landform.

2001, the MGS took another photo of the ""Face"" and it revealed an extrodinary photo. By this time the technology has gotten way better. You can see that the photo shows an ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"". Those are common landforms around the America West.

Inconclusion, the 1998 and the 2001 photos show its just and natural landform. It isn't made by aliens it's not an alien monument.",3,1,0.8110693097114563
5c9a0e0,"Mars has always been a big part in our curiosity for outer space. We are always secretly hoping that there is some form of life out there other than down here. I do believe that this face is a natural landform because the picture quality back then was not all too great, this place is known for it's ""Martian mesa's"", and they only unveiled it to the general public for attention and hopefully more money in their funding.

I believe that this ""face"" so to speak is actually just another lanform on the terrain that is Mars. I believe that it is a landform becase as you can see the picture quality in 1976 is much more different than the quality of the picture in 2001. That said, Mars is known for it's powerful windstorms, so the earth could have shifted over time. That just makes it even more of a landform though.

I also believe that this so called ""face"" is not an actual face because the scientists stated that in the region of Cydonia it was common to find what they call ""Martain mesas"" which means it just so happens to be another freaky concidence instead of some actual huge martian face. Not even the actual scientists believed that it was an actual martian. They did think so for a short while and they're honestly dumb. In my opinion, until the day where some other form of life comes down to Earth, there is no such way there could be martian life.

I believe that this isn't an actual face also because NASA unveiled it to the general public just for attention and possibly some money. Let's face it, NASA doesn't get very much funding. I'm guessing that they unveiled it to the public for attention saying ""look at me, look at me I'm some important Martian face and you should give the people who found me more money so they can find other things like me with better equipment."" Which in my opinion it's just plain sad. Don't get me wrong I support NASA all the way, but when they have to do something like this just to get fame and perchance a little bit of money, it's a little sad.

We all know that with more fame comes more money (let's not talk about Kanye West shall we?) There are people like Selena Gomez and Donald Trump who have so much money from all the fame they're getting. When in reality they aren't contributing much to society except for the fact that they are just spewing a lot of junk out of their mouths. Whereto people working at places such as NASA have not very much funding and are still attempting to change the world, which is really really beautiul.

In the end, this ""face"" is nothing but a silly little landform on the face of Mars. I still firmly believe it because the picture quality back then was not all too great, this place is known for it's ""Martian mesa's"", and they only unveiled it to the general public for attention and hopefully more money in their funding. This is the sad truth in this whole operation, but it is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. They aren't fooling anyone when they say that this little scheme of theirs is actually some form of extratresstrial life.  ",4,1,0.8827788829803467
5cb4ffd,"Imagine going to outer space, and you land on Mars. When you get there you find a landform that you haven't seen before. This could be something big, but you know it isn't alive, so you have to assume it is a landform. When you go back and show everyone what you found people think it is an alien, but further investigations show it is a natural landform. This Face is a natural landform because no one has ever seen something like this before, no one has any proof that it is a human or alien, and NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor say it is a landform.

First of all, no one has seen anything like this before. The text states,"" There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors."" This peice of evidence shows that the face is new to them, and they don't know what it is. Another piece of evidence is,"" Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars."" This, also, shows that NASA doesn't know what it is. If no one knows what it is then you can't say it is a human or alien without knowing the facts.

Secondly, no one has any proof that it could be an alien or a human. For instance, the text states,"" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa."" This piece of evidence shows that they can't figure out exactly what the face is. They are making aussumtions of what the face might be, but they aren't one-hundred percent sure of what it is. NASA would have to have proof to say it is an alien or not.

Lastly, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet he found out the face was a natural landform. For example, the text states,"" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" This shows that once they got a clear picture of the face, the JPL found out it was just an ordinary landform. The text also states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" This piece of evidence found in the text shows that NASA figured out that the face was a landform. Yes, the face did look like a human, but the NASA found out it was a landform when they closely examined the it.

In conclusion, the face that was thought to be an alien or a human was clearly a natural landform. First of all, it was never seen before, so no one could be sure of what it was. Secondly, people just assumed it was an alien or a human, and they had no proof that it was. Lastly, the Mars Global Surveyor found out the face was a natural landform. This evidence shows that face everyone thought was an alien was actually a natural landform.       ",4,1,0.8089895844459534

5cebc1a,"The ""Face"" was not made by aliens. I know this for three reasons. One, it's just a natural form. Two, they have yet to be actually seen. Three, they should have found us by now. Here's how I know.

The ""Face"" is simply a natural form. One, it looks just like a mesa. It most likely has been there by just nature in some form. Two, there are no specific details from being ""hand made."" It the aliens created it don't you think they would make it more detailed. It is just unreasonable for it to be made by aliens.

If there are aliens why have we yet to see them. One, in all the images there is absolutely no sign of them. We have so many images with zero sign of them. Two, with all our high technology we would've found them by now. We are able to create so many crazy things, but not see a simple alien? That to me is insane.

At least they wouldve found us. One, with all the suff we got goin on in

space don't you think the would've noticed us by now. Two, if they can do all these supernatural things in space and on Earth like the so-called crop circles dont you think they would stop the hiding? If the do all these things why can't they just show us who the credit goes to?

The ""Face"" was not made by aliens. I know this for the reasons above. The ""Face"" is a natural form. We have yet to see these aliens. Also, at the least they wouldve found us. Therefore, I know aliens are not real and that thing is a mesa.    ",3,1,0.7549464702606201
5d34717,"So, what do you think the Face in the ground was created by? In my opinion, the Face was created by a natural landforms on mars. Resesachers of NASA have done serious reseach over the years just to tell how the Face was created. Pictures have been taking from differnt cameras over the years just to continue the long search on the Face. From, 1976 to 2001, the evidence in the picture has changed everytime.

The article states, "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, "" he added. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" What the article is saying that there might have some kind of landform that created the Face. People are still curios til this very day on how the Face was formed or created. So, in my opinion the Face was created by a natural landform on Mars.

Some people think it's created by aliens. When there seems to be no type of life form on Mars. The

Face has changed over the processes in the picture. In my arguementive essay, I still haven't changed my theisis about how the Face was created. Through out the article, it tells you on how they processed the long journey to take the photo and make it clear on what it is. ",2,1,0.9004753232002258
5d43879,"Well I do believe in supernatural life form, but i don't think that aliens would do things like this. Personally based on my opinion is that it could've been just the way it looks. Like how it resembles a human face, has eyes, a nose, the head shape, could be just the way it devoloped over decades and centuries over time. This does'nt mean that it work of an unknown species. Its just a natural landform that has developed the shape of a human face over time. But i can also see how other would think that. yes, I admit it is an odd thing to see, but theres a million different stories of how this particular piece became known to all the human race. So us scientists, at NASA are going to find the real story behind this unfounded clue. Also do promise that the story that we get will be the truth, and also be shared to the public people of the United States. This clue has a million questions, and a million accusations. But what i think over my years of research is that there was no alien lifeform that created the face of mars. Just alot of great odd things happen. It just seems to be that this is one of them. But us scientists at NASA promise to find the real truth, tell the real truth, and plan to make it known to the human race.",2,1,0.8339967727661133
5d52409,"Lets face the facts the face on Mars is nothing more than clever illusion. The face that you have no doubt seen on mars isn't proof of alein life it just doesn't make logical sense. The higher quality photos don't even show the face, and why would NASA cover up somthing that would help them with their budget issues. Its clearly just rock formation just like ones we have on earth.

First of all the first picture was just a lucky happenstance. When NASA went back in to get a higher quality photo, it wasn't there. The face was just a product of clouds and outdated equipment. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" (P10) The best quality photo, and it looked less like a face and more like a pile of broken dreams.

Some hardcore conspiracy theorists might say NASA was trying to pull a wool over our eyes and cover up the existents of extraterestrial life with fake pictures. But why would NASA cover somthing as earth shattering as aliens, the publicity alone would help push the government to extend their budget."" Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (P5) Why would litteral rocket scientists cover up something that would help the massively.

Thirdly it's just like rock formations we have on earth. In the article one scientist even says it looks just like a butte we have on Earth. "" It reminds me of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" (P12) We are all losing our heads over somthing that we could drive to Idaho in a matter of hours to see.

Overall only crazy conspiracy nuts could ignore the facts to this degree. Its was a one time photo that happened almost 40 years ago. People need to quit ignoring the facts and see whats right in front of them. The face on Mars is just a natural land form that, under the right conditions, can look like a face.

5d7b9ba,"The Face on Mars was site to see and i think its a site to behold. Still there are some people that think the Face on Mars was created by Aliens,but its not. Conspiracy theorists might say this but i don't believe it, but my colleague does. So, I created this special report to show my friend that the Face is just a landform.

First off, the technology back in 1976 wasn't very good. The 1976 photo of the Face looks very blurry from the looks of it.When tech got an upgrade in 1998, the image wasn't as blurry as the first photo. Then, in 2001, NASA took a another photo of the Face when the conditions on Mars were just right and proved it was a landform.

Second, Mesa and Buttes are area of raised land, so I bet that since the area here is higher than any other area, it could create a shadow over it.The Face is located in the north Martian latitude where it was winter, which is a cloudy time of year for the Red planet. The camera on the MGS had to try and see through the clouds to see. NASA said it was not easy to target Cydonia(the region where Face on Mars is located) because the MGS is a mapping spacecraft that looks straight down and ca't move anywhere else.

Lastly, NASA had to be in the perfect spot to take a picture. In 2001, the MGS was able to get close enough to get a look at Face. Jim Garvin's team had to center the craft to get a good enough angle on the Face. To prove for sure that it was a landform, Garvin used the camera's maximum resolution to get the best pictures. Garvin said that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were any objects in the photo, you would see them.

I think that is enough evidence to show my friend that the Face on Mars is a landform.Sadly, I wish it was truly created by Martians. That would be an interesting find if I do say so myself.",3,1,0.8648996353149414
5d86e9b,"Is the Face just a natural landform? Yes, the Face on Mars is just a gigantic rock formed by shawdows. In paragraph 5, it say it's a rock that resembled a head. It shows an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth making it look like something it actually is not. NASA has all the evidence to prove that their isn't a face on the planet Mars, but just a regular landform.

Some people were unsatisfied and some was with the conclusion NASA came up with involving the Face on Mars. Others thought perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze. In paragraph 9, Garvin stated, "" it's not that easy to target Cydonia."" He also said, ""In fact, it's hard work."" People were so ungrateful with the answers that were given to them, so NASA had to go through too much trouble to hit them with more evidence again.

In Conclusion, I would like to say that Nasa was 100 percent right when they said it was only a landform. There was three pictures taken from years 1976-2001. With the years 1976 and 1998, people absolutely believed that their was a face on our planet Mars, but by 2001, more people was convinced there was no face on Mars, but a landform like NASA have been telling them. In paragraph 7, its says there was no alien monument after all. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A butte/mesa is landforms common around the American West. As much as people may think Mars have a face on it, we all know that it does not. the question everyone wanted to know is, Is the Face just a natural landform? It took citizens 25 years to finally say yes to the question. Even though Unmasking the Face on Mars was very disappointing, people eventually got over it.",3,1,0.9112410545349121
5d99b40,"The Face on Mars is a very mysterious thing, but it's only been caught on camera, clearly, once, but that was in the 1970s. The cameras in 1976 were not very clear, as you see they have a 43 meter span per pixel, which makes the picture a whole lot more blurry. Even though it's been seen all over the world as an unknown landform or an alien artifact, the evidence has been seen through, and the face, is, well, not really a face at all.

The Face on Mars was a very popular symbol for the alien conspirators, because they thought that the picture gave solid proof of aliens clearly doing work on the planet Mars. Yet there's a problem, that picture was taken in the 1970s, and if you remember, the cameras weren't all that great. And there have been multiple other pictures taken of the same landformation, like in 1998, and 2001. Yet the picture doesn't depict an Egyption face staring back at you, but a standard, normal, everyday, Mars mesa. The pictures of the face in 1998 showed clearly that the face wasn't quite a face, with a camera 10 times sharper than the original Viking camera, yet the public wasn't satisfied saying how the camera couldn't spot the face out because it was a cloudy time of the year for Mars. Furthermore 3 years later they took more pictures of the exact place of the original siting of the mysterious and erriy face, but once again the cameras do not lie as it unvieled the same blan rock formation, but the press couldn't argue this time. The cameras' span was 1.56 meters per pixel compared to the Viking's 46 meters per pixel, and the planet of Mars was as clear as the eye could see at that time, but there was no unnatural objects to be seen. Yes, it is hard to prove that the famous mesa isn't man-made, you would have to be on the planet to do that, yet the facts and research is all here and it's time to let go.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars has been very iconic on what it has done to the people, and the world as a whole. It's been analyzed and researched over, over, and over again. And it all comes down to the cold hard facts, which all points to the intriging rock of 1976 of being just a rock formation that was, well, lets just say, for now... misunderstood.

5de4838,"NASA discovered a mysterious picture twenty five years ago that changed how people looked at Mars forever.They were using viking 1 space craft as they were trying to find possible landing sites of his sister viking 2, while they were looking, they found a blurry human like face on a region called Cydonia.

NASA quickly showed it to the public to show how interesting Mars was. People quickly became obssesed

with ""The face on Mars"" and started making theories that Mars had or even that it has life on Mars. Because of the graphics of the viking 1 scientists weren't sure what it was exactly, some scientists believed it was actually alien evidence existence but the rest of them belived to be a mesa.

Everything was ruined in September 1977 when

global surveyor (MGS) came to Mars to take some photos at the ""Face on Mars"" to finally put an end to this. Finally when the aircraft arrived to Cydonia it took various pictures that had ten times sharper shots than the viking 1

In the text before the first paragraph the article states that, ""New high resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" Which shows factual evidence as to how the Face is just a natural landform that happens to look like a human face because of texture and shadowing. It is silly to think that an alien race would create something like the Face, because evidence shows it is just a landform.

NASA decribes the Face as a "" huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth."" The big reason why some may believe that the Face was created by aliens is because of all the film, books, magazines, and talk shows it has appeared in. All of the popularity attracts conspiracy theorists to make up some way to gain more attention to it. The theorists claim that NASA is hiding the ""true"" way it was made so they don't frighten citizens, but NASA exclaims that they wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars to fund their budget.

Even though a few scientest believe the Face was an alien artifact, photos show otherwise. On April 5, 1998 they snapped a picture and discovered it was simply a natural landform, not an alien monument. At first the photos weren't very convincing to either side, but once they were able to enhance technology the photo came out clearer. Which allowed scientests at NASA to examine it further and finally classify it.

Therefore, NASA came to the conclusion that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mese-"". It is fun to imagine that another life form made a shrine like thing to what looks like a human, but it is very unreasonable considering all the facts that were gathered. If one reviews over the facts they can see that; the Face is just a natural landform, populartity of the Face is what brought theorists to it, and all the evidence points to it being just a landform with a very exciting look to it.

Outsiders, some of them at least, thought it had something to do with aliens and a conspiracy theory, but NASA didn't seem to agree and thought it was nothing but a landform and a picture taken at the right time.

Even thought the figure does seem quite mysterious doesn't mean it's and acient alien artifact. Becuase of technlogy and how cameras dont always capture what really there. For instance, ever taken a picture of a sunset and the colors didn't look the exact same as they did in person, well, this might be the same case. ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face."" The camera might have taken the picture in a way that the human eye couldn't see. It might have added extra, or inhanced shadows making it look like a face. You'd also have to think about the angle the picture was taken in. Maybe in person from a different angle it looked like nothing but a rock, but when a picture is taken and the shadows have changed it looks like a real face with eyes, a nose and even a mouth.

Meanwhile back down on planet earth some people may be going insane and think that this has something do to with aliens and a conspiracy theory. There is no proof that the landform has anything to do with aliens except for its odd shape. Since there is no known life on Cydonia people don't know what type of strange weather or temperature changes they could've had that effected the shape of it. People tend to think what they want to believe and not look at the facts. They like to ignore whats really there and think what they want to think to create some type of excitment in their life. ""It has starred ina Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" Then when a small amount of people started to think this had something to do with aliens more people started to believe also, and thats when it went viral.

However, since no one has been down to see the strange landform nobody can confirm that it is either just a landform or an alien artifact. And it is a strange looking figure and sort of unexplainable so I can see why people first thought it had to do with a conspricy theory. But there are more reasons for it to be nothing but a landform rather than an artifact. The best thing to do is look at the facts and not believe what you want to believe just because it is exciting.

In conclusion, as exciting as it would be for this is odd looking figure to be, or have anything to do with aliens, it's nothing but a landform that looks like an alien face. And because of technolgy and peoples creative minds its features were inhanced and made to look real. You can think what you want and believe what you want, but look at the facts, it was nothing but a mere photographed mistake.      ",5,1,0.7426068186759949
5e2df05,"Greetings! I have heard that you think the Face on Mars, is a face that was created by aliens. I believe that this ""face"" is just a natural landform. I will support my claim why I think this, and maybe you will finally believe, that there are no such things as aliens.

There are many reasons why the Face is just a natural landform. On the second sentence paragraph, it says that we scientists have figured that the Face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only that this one had unusual shadows, which made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. The reason some people think it look like an alien, was because it looked like a real face, but it looks like a face, because the shadows formed on the rock give off illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth. On paragraph 7, it is said that Machael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the origninal Viking phots. Later on, thoughsands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appear. When it finally did, the site revealed a natural landorm. People were not satisfied, because it was a cloudy day on Mars. The scientists decided to prove that it was just a landform, so when it was not cloudy, they took another picture. In the final paragraph, paragraph 12, it says that what the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a btte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. A man name Garvin says, ""That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The lava dome is most of Middle Butte in the Snake Riber Plaint of Idaho.

So, in conclusion, if you first thought that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, than I hope I have gave your enough information, and persuaded you that it is really just a natural landform. I am sorry if you thought it was made by aliens, but it wasn't. I hope that you could understand, and see that it was just the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.",3,1,0.9228729009628296

One reason that the landform could be real is by pointing out that back then the cameras were not as good with quality so the camera could make it look like that. Another reason could also br the weather in that time the weather could have a big part in the way it looks.

The angel of the camera could also make a big diffrence in the look of it. the angel of the light that was ln it also could mae the changed because it was the shadow that made the landform look like a human head. Back then the pixels of the photo were 43 meters compared to now which is 1.56 meters. The clouds could also change the look.

Another reason i think the face on Mars is fake is, if there were civilations on mars they would also on the 3D image. So if there are no homes or shelthers there, who made it? No one did. It is a natural formation. Just like the ones in the United States of America. In the U.S.A those types of formations form in the Midwest. The formation is actualy called a butte or mesa.

It is a natural landform, that was just created over time. No matter how much you wanna disagree with me, i'm telling you that is what it is.

NASA also thinks that there was egyptain pryamids, that humans created. NASA is disagreeing with a lot of people, saying that humans onced live on mars, and that when they lived there they created all of those thing. Another thing why I am thinking and telling you it is a natural landform, is because not one single person could live on Mars, that long to build anything on it. We all know the reason why people can't live on Mars, well if you don't know then let me tell you, it is because of all the weather they have, and all the big bad wind and dust storms they have.

There is no possible way that a human could of built this in that short amount of time it had been there. Another reason why I am telling that it is a natural landform, is because, a human couldn't have built one of these things, because it sometime takes almost up to years to create things like these. Because of the wind Mars couldn't have all those human like features.

Thats why I am telling you, and you can disagree with me all you want to, but i'm telling you that i'm right, and that no person could ever live that long on a planet, that can't even have any hum possibly live on it. ",3,1,0.8085704445838928

5ebc160,"In 1976, a Mars Global Surveyor snapped pictures of what is known as the ""Face on Mars."" It is a natural landformation and is visible becuase of the pictures shown, the internet, and the area the landform is located.

First, the pictures show the ""face."" In 1976, the pixels were 43m (meters) per pixel. In 2001, the pixels were only 1.56m per pixel. The quality is worse the bigger the pixels.

In 2001, the quality of the pixels were clear enough to show that the ""face"" was only a lanform. In the picture of 1976, it is visible that the picture is blurry. In the picture of 1998, the picture is less blurry, but still hard to see. In the 2001 picturer, the picture is very visible and well seen. At the bottom of the mesa, it is also visible to see the lanform has a rounded, smooth, almost non man-made surface that buried the landform into the planet side.

Next, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed. A landform.

In the text, it states that when the picture was taken in 1998, it was the cloudy time of theyear on the red planet.

Finally, where the ""face"" is located. The face is located in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.

In the article, it states that ""The sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Although the NASA researchers have concluded the ""face"" to be a natural landform, many are not satisfied with it.

Many people claim that it was built by aliens, however, pictures do not lie.

5ed754b,"This object on Mars has been theorized to be a face, but there is no way this could represent life on Mars. There are many pictures of Mars and nothing else showed that there could be life. There are many reasons why this is not a factor that shows that there is life on Mars. There is not enough resources, it was shown to be a natural landform after better technology was used, and it is similar to the Middle Butte in Idaho as mentioned in the article.

My first reason, is that there is not enough resources to be able to have life on Mars. There is barely any water except for ice on Mars. There are no plants to create oxygen. There have been no signs of any thing to provide life other than the frozen water as previously mentioned. Most of all Mars is too cold to be able to have life on it. The only way for something to live on Mars is if something somehow adapted to that type of enviroment.

Another reason, is that it was shown to be a mesa type lanform. The first picture was similar to a face because technology was not advanced enough to take a clearer picture. After we made better technology we were able to get a better and clearer picture that shows it was just a landform.

My third and final reason, is that it is very similar to landforms on our planet. We have mesas amd buttes all over our planet. The one that is most similar is in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Many pictures shown that the ""face on Mars"" is not real.

All of these reasons show that there is no way that this is a sign of life on Mars. As I mentioned there is not enough resources, it was shown to be a landform, and that it is similar to landforms here on Earth. So there is no way that this is a sign of another form of life other than the life on our planet.                                                       ",3,1,0.7726461887359619
5ee3109,"The face on Mars is just a natural landform. There is no facts showing that it is not just a landform. If aleins were to build this landform we would have been aware of it.

The Mars face is actually a messa which are common sight in the American West. So this is strong proof that it is actually just a natural landform. If there was something out there like aleins which would have been proven to be real by now we would have proof of there existince then that could be another explanation but since we have no proof that they exist then we quikley ruled out that as a option

We knew as soon as the pictures where released that the critics and media would go go crazy on Nasa. Of course we know that theres people that are going to think Nasa is hiding information from the public but if there was life on Mars we would people to know that. When all the pictures came out they made a bunch of money. The face has actually become an pop icon. So if there was life on Mars we would want to share it with the public.

If the face wasnt a natural landform what is it then thats what i would like to know. Dont you think if it wasnt a landform we would want people to know we could make billions! For some people to think we're hiding something is crazy. There is proof that it's just a landform and that's is what all of us at Nasa have been saying for a long time now.

In part of the discussion this evidence is told false as well, some workers there have shown that this is known to be a anatural landform on the planet which created during different phases in the weather. A team of Global Surveyor has flew over to tell that there was no known pictures/image of an alien monument.

5f3892b,"Do you believe that the face on Mars is made by aliens? I know my opinion doesnt matter, what matters is whats real. I know you are also thinking that this is crazy, because we all know aliens do not exist. There is no proof of aliens.

It has to be a natural landform, because in the 12th paragraph Garvin said it reminded him of Most Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. Our universe can create anything, just because something look like it was made does not mean it is. There could of been rocks there, and the dust just blows around them. Making it look like it was made, by something or someone. The very most obvious thing is aliens do not exist, there has been no proof of alien. Even to this day in 2016 there is still no proof of aliens.

In the 3rd paragraph NASA even mentioned it as a ""huge rock formation"" scientist are very smart if there was other such thing that made it, it would have already been discovered. Also the face on Mars was a good way to get attention, like paragraph number 5 said so. The face of Mars turned into a famous pop icon. It was on Hollywood films, all the way to Haunted grocery store check out lines. If people could get the public to think that it was aliens that made the face, it would have maybe become way more popular. Plus most people do not believe in such thing as aliens, if they do not have real proof.

My very last example is , if NASA found out was aliens they would have already told the public. It would be huge for NASA to discover aleins. There is no way they would hide the proof that aliens are real. It would help their budget, if they did discover an ancient alien civilization on mars. As it says in paragraph 6 scientist started hunting for more information. It became a priority for them. All the pictures they took revealed it as a natural landformation as it says in paragraph 7.

There is no way it is related to Aliens. So if someone says that NASA is just hiding it, it would be false. NASA would surely reveal that there is aliens on another planet. Just imagine how much attention they would get if they actually discovered it. They would probably be one of the richest people. It is positive that a face on mars, made by aliens is not real. It is just a natural landform of rocks, that looks like a face. ",4,1,0.8852198719978333

In the article it states that few scientist believe that was made by a alien. Another reason I think it is just a natural landform is because this is natural in the Amearican west. My last reason I think that it is a natural landform because scientist believed it was just another Martian Mesa.

My first reason why my opinion is it is a landform because it states in paragraph six that few scientist believe that is was aliens. Also in paragraph seven it states it was a natural landform and there was no alien movement after all. This is one of the biggest reasons why I support my opinion that this is a landform.

My next reason why my opinion is it is a landform is this has happened many other places in America. In paragrqaph twelve it states that landforms common around the American west. ""It remindes me most of Middle Butte in the snake river Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolatwed mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."" The American west has plenty of things like the Face of Mars.

that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" This was my last reason why I believe that is was just a landform.

5f6e51d,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face of Mars"", a theory is presented to the readers, that alien life form could have caused the '""face on mars"". There are diffrent reasons on why that image is there, besides ""aliens"" put it there. It could be butte mesa. Also cameras sent in space would have picked up on something unusual. Scientist don't present a theory unless they have evidence to back it up.

One reason that the ""face on mars"" is there, is butte mesa. Which is usually shadows that make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Butte mesa are found in West America, one example of the butte mesa is in Snake River Plain of Idaho. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. The mesa located in Idaho is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Another thing, is that cameras are sent into space to take pictures of planets and record everything that is found. Scientist enlarge the photos 3 times bigger, to see everthing within it. If there were anything in the picture that seemed unusual, the cameras would allow you to see it. Any objects, like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyrsmids. Even small shacks, you would be able to see it.

Thirdly, scientists don't present a theory unless they have gone threw precautions and looked over all of there evidence to support the theory. In the article it talks about how the scientists, sent two diffrent cameras up to make sure the clouds wren't the issue of what they saw. Also, they blew the images up to see if there was an objects. To make sure that nothing could endanger there theory, of it just being a butte mesa. If the scientists really didnt believe there theory was valed, they would'nt have taken so many precautions.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is probably just a naturally occuring landform on Mars. With the evidence of the butte mesa in West America. The cameras going up and taking pictures more than once. Also, the scientists taking many precautions to prove that the ""Face on Mars"", is a butte mesa.

5f73006,"My name is Bob Greene. I am a scientist at Nasa and I am explaining the ""Face of Mars"" to a man who thinks that this is a sign of an alien artifact. The man continues to argue with me and say that aliens are real and this alien artifact looks like a human face. I have to keep telling him that this is just a natural landform which is called a butte or mesa. This certain mesa looks like a face only because it shows most of the characteristics that a human has such as; the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth which are all just formed by shadows. The man asked how does NASA know that this rock formation that you ""supposedly"" think, is a mesa? He just thinks that it's a sign of aliens. I tell him that Nasa was able to figure it out because a mesa is a a big rock formation that just has a flat top and thats what the face looked like if you see it up close. He still did not believe me. I told him we will find out and we did.

On April 8, 2001, our team NASA (including me), got a clear picture of this ""face"". The Mars Global Surveyor went just close enough for a look at the Face which was the perfect cloudless day. NASA was able to get a picture many times more clearer than the 1976 Viking photo.

Many people who thought that the ""face"" was an alien artifact were waiting to see Nasa release how the picture looks like. Nasa finally revealed that the picture was a... mesa! Many people were dissappointed but some thought that it was just a conspiracy from NASA to keep aliens hidden from people on the outside. I once again saw the man who I argued with years before about the ""face"". I then told him that his thoughts were wrong but he told me that NASA just wants to keep aliens a secret. Oh boy, here we go again. So finally NASA officially said that this was just a illusion of a face that people had.",3,1,0.7913004159927368
5fbfe66,"How do you think the Face was formed. There could be many reasons how the Face was formed. However I think that the Face was not formed by aliens. One reason is, is that they haven't prove that aliens are real yet. Also, that the day they took they picture they said that there was wispy clouds over it. Another reason is that it all happend because of science.

Mars is an odd planet, I've heard people call it the pizza planets because it was red, I think. That's not the point though, the point is, is that the planet has not proven that aliens live on that planet. The face had been thought it was created by aliens. NASA said that the Face was a ""huge rock formation"" showing the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. There are more reasons why they face was Face was not formed by aliens.

Another reason is that the day they took the picture, there was wispy winds. In order to take a good picture you need to have good weather. The weather can effect the picture because if it's windy you need to make sure that everything is not blowing around. The wispy winds could have effected the picutre becuase the winds were blowing so the rocks, sand and everything else was blowing around. So, when Viking 1 captured that picture, it can everything else blowing with it. Wind storms happen on planets, I am not sure om which ones but i know they happen-just like how on the sun it doesn't have wind storms but has almosr like volcanic action on it with lave everywhere. There is one more other reason.

One more reason is that is just plain old science. Science occurs in a lot of discussing and working on the planet. When planning to send some sort of machine to a planet, you have to undertand the planet. In 1976 there wasn't the best technology at the time. They didn't know when a storm was gonna come or if they would have to send their machines threw a bunch of metors. When they sent out Viking 1 a win storm occured and the camera on Viking 1 couldn't focus right and that is why it looked like a face.

There are many more reasons why the Face was not formed but an aliens. Some are that it was that aliens have not been proven yet. Also, that there was wispy clounds. One more is that is was all science. Those are resons why that the Face was not formed by aliens.",3,1,0.8296550512313843
5fcd46c,"Sometimes, it's fun to imagine that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact. However, some conspiracy theorists believe that the Face on Mars really is the work of aliens. This claim is not only outlandish, but it lacks any kind of proof to support it. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

The fact that the Face on Mars is a natural landform has been proven by photographs taken by NASA spacecrafts. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor was able to take a picture of the Face on Mars, one that was much clearer than the original picture taken by the Viking in 1976. Based on the new photo, the general verdict was that the Face on Mars is just a mesa, a natural landform. To clear all dispute that the Face isn't an alien artifact, NASA took another, even clearer picture of the Face in April 8, 2001,

to prove for once and for all that the Face isn't of alien origin. The picture stands as definitive proof that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

The discovery of an alien artifact on Mars would help NASA. Even if the Face on Mars was made by aliens, NASA has no reason to cover up the discovery of former alien existence on Mars. If NASA found and released the concrete evidence of an alien artifact, they would gain an increased budget and greater public rapport to find more information. It would reignite our curiosity of outer space. Therefore, discovery of an alien artifact would help NASA, not hurt them.

Others say that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact that NASA is trying to hide from us. However, alien discovery would benefit NASA more than it would harm them. Furthermore, if NASA really wanted to hide the existence of a possible alien artifact, why would they show us the pictures of the Face on Mars

in the first place? Coupling this reasoning with the clear pictures from NASA spacecrafts completely blows this theory out of the water.

The evidence in this article prove that the Face on Mars is a natural monument, not an alien artifact. Any continued skepticism on this is unjustified

and quite frankly silly. Although it is fun to imagine that the Face is alien, it is important that we know when to draw the line between imagination and a laughable statement.",4,1,0.9277006983757019

Or it could be a crater formed in the shape of a human face.

One reason that i know that the face on mars is not from aliens is because this face has been there since we have known mars.In 1976 NASA could se a little bit of what was a face. In 1998 you could see it form more and more due to natural causes. In 2001 you could tell that the face on the moon was a face.

The face also had some little stream through it, most likely that a alien wouldn't do.

And Michael Malin and her team flew over mars and took a sharp photo that made it obvious that the aliens did not do this to mars.

And in 2001 it was a summer day in mars so they snapped a picture better then ever, and they say that if there was anything on Mars then it would have shown on the picture, and nothing did. So thats proof that the aliens did not put the face on mars.

The 2001 clearly states that it was in no way a face or an ancient civilization on Mars.

Don't believe every news healine and story you see. Everyone has seen the magazines you find that pulls people in with hazardous rumors and lies, things that just aren't true. The '' Face on Mars '' happens to be a pretty big deal. Its been in movies, radio shows, magazines and a whole lot more. But is all of that really something that you can take full trust in. Not every writer, newspaper and magazine is right. They don't always get good information thats why you stick to someone you know who will tell you the truth like a scienctist.

So in conclusion, "" The Face on Mars'' isn't really a face at all nor a ancient alien artifact. It's simply a natual landform most likely a mesa or butte. Trust me its not a face its just weird shadows that make it seem to look like a face. If there was really something to see by now we would have seen it and the facts are not in favour of silly conspiracy theorists. Now you know "" The Face on Mars'' is more like a mesa on mars.",4,1,0.8920321464538574
60225ae,"have u wondered wat is that face on mars? Is it proof of life or just a natural landform, well i am here to tell u its just a natural landform.

Its a juts a natural landform because in the story it says NASA unveiled the image for all the see and the cption noted a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadelows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth making it look like proof of life on mars. If u need more proof on april 5, 1998 the MOC team snapped a picture tens times sharper than the original viking photos. thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform.

So thats proof thats it just a natural landform and not proof of life on mars, but maybe soon NASA will find proof of living life on mars.   ",2,1,0.866811215877533

we would have saw it with the sattlites. So please belive me when i say that this rock was not created by alines at all! okay so i heard someone thought there was alines on mars. now im going to be honest from what weve seen there is no such thing yes there may be life on mars but small life. Nothing big enough to build something like this.

The only life on mars may be bacteria Now please whoever is saying there are alines please stop. That will be all today proving another myth There is no such thing as aliens on mars. in the article it says that they were made by shadows bealive me when i say its true. If there was such thangs as aliens dont you think we would have found them by now? like honestly we have been looking for them fo years. and nothing trust me there is no alien life on mars. the face in the photo is even blury and doesnt look right this is becasue of sand and dust all over this. it causes an allusion to make u think that there is a face but in reality its not! the photo in 1976 people say its Not just a coquencedence there is a human face on mars. Picture this looking up in the clouds and seeing an animal its just clouds grouped together to make that image. Aleins didnt make that it happened naturally just like on mars.

now that i have explained that there is no life on maars people will now know the truth. And hopefully i dont have to hear about this again because all people are worried about is are there aliens if there were aliens i think we would have known by now.

And it says in paragraph 8 its just a haze please stop making excusaes for ther eto be alien life on mars!          ",2,1,0.7482671737670898
605f34f,"What I would say to a person who thinks that the face on Mars was created by aliens is this , for one we have never found any living things besides bateria and organisims on another plant. The reason why I say this is because NASA has no proof besides what they think is a face created by aliens on Mars. I have watched many shows about space and other shows like Brian Games. Brian Games had a show about faces, and it said that you can see an object and make it look human or make it look like a face, such as a specific flower that might look like a face. This is what those scientists are doing in this very situation. They are mistaking a natural made land form on Mars as an alien build face. There are many ways this landform could have been made. It could have been made by wind and rocks blowing across what you could say is a landscape. As you can see from the landform is that it has faided away over time and now looks like a lump of sand, which wouldn't you think if aliens made that they would fix it up and make it look like a face again? So this is my argument on why I believe that this is just a natural made landform.",2,1,0.906988263130188
606be34,"Timmy thinks the faces on Mars were created by aliens,but i keep telling him its just natural landforms that we made and it looks like faces. It happens even on Earth, it is common around the American west. In the viking photo they didn't have that well equitment to see what it actually was, so they thought it was created by aleins. In 2001, NASA wanter to show the world and the captioned a note by it saying ""huge rock formation,"" but people just saw a face because of the shadows in it. The authors reasoned it to be a good idea to engage people and give attention to Mars.

The ""Faces on Mars"" started to become popular, they started to make movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. In April 1998 they flew over it again, they had better technology,and they didn't see a face all they saw was a natural landform. Then in 2001 they did it again and didn't see anything just the landform and they had much better technology where you could see a small shack and nothing was there.

These Faces were just landforms that had a shadow that made it look like a face.

Every plantet has weird landforms, and they didn't really have good techlology back then. Now they have alot better technology were they can drive robots on mars and see all these weird landforms and see if there is aliens. ",2,1,0.8852258920669556
60a385e,"The Face on Mars is not a legitimate face or a creation of aliens. Conspiracy theorists seem to think it really is. The landform is comparable to the multitude or butte or mesa landforms found here on Earth. The picture taken in 2001 has three times the pixels sizes compared to the pixels in '76, also if this Martian landform was indeed crafted by aliens it would benefit NASA a lot.

The Face on Mars can be compared to the lot of landforms in the Western America. One scientists, Garvin, recalled ""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho."" This can also be a reminder of other landforms, such as the Appilachian Mountain or Old Faithful- the water geyser at Yosemite National Park. In Cydonia, there are also quite a few odd landforms. The Face is just another one of the many unexplainable formations on Mars.

The day the picture of the Face was taken, the people in the spacecraft had to go through many misty clouds. That day was a cloudy day on Mars. The picture taken had three times the pixels than the picture taken in April of 1998.The picture was clearer and one could see that the shadows that creates the parts

of the face are just only shadows. The only unusual thing about it was that it looked ""like an Egyptian Pharoh.""

The main reason conspiracy theorists would believe the Face in an alien craft is because it is an unusual landform. NASA scientists wanted more attention toward Mars and they wish there really was an Ancient Martian colony. It would benefit NASA and its funding.

One now can come to the conclusion that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. The Martian landform is quite similar to the ones found in western America. The original picture taken in '76 had less pixels making the picture appear odd, and if this was a formation created by aliens, NASA would use it as a benefit.",3,1,0.8951283097267151

Im here to tell you people that thats a type of formation that happens. Like Garvin said its a type of landform that happens in the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Im gonna tell you why i agree. Us as a NASA team we work hard to solve what it was such as reasearch, scientists working, and our team that snapped the picture. All of us tried to figure out what it was yes we might of thought that it was some type of alien structure but like i said working hard got us where we needed to be. After what we needed to figure out we realized that it wasn't some alien structure using the ""Rule of Thumb"" we saw the picture 3 times bigger. After we saw that image we atoumatically realized that it was a simple formation same as what happens to earth. Example like what happen to Colorado. It use to have a river but after years the water started to evaperate and it started forming big giant rocks. Thats why i don't thing that its some kind of alien structure. ",2,1,0.8303635120391846

He responed that he dont know i said you have to know something but then he saw an picture and he said the picture look like alien heads.

Then i gave him my response he said why you don't think it's aliens i told him i don't belive and aliens. He said thats not a good enough reason because i did not state facts so i told him the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. The argument kept going on because he said i dont know what a alien look like so you dont.

Last, we came together an said we dont know cause we kept arguing about how was a alien and how it was not a alien. He did not like my response when i said i dont know how they look how they sound thats why i said it was not a alien. It also kept going cause i did not like his response he did give me details or nothing.

This was not made by aliens it is a natural landform that has shadows that cause the lanndform to have such apperences as a nose, mouth, and ears.

The Face is just a landform because in the passage is says that with newer technology they would have been able to see other things on Mars. The passage says that the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The MSG had the best camera on it taking the best photos. Each of the pixels spans 1.56 meters compared to the 4 meters the best Viking photo that was ever taken.

After the first Viking photo was taken it instatly appeared on the JPL web site. When the photo appeared they noticed that is was just a natural landform and that there was no alien statue after all.

I also state that ""a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Conspiracy therorist think NASA would hide this evidence from the world. Nasa shows an image with a caption that says ""huge rock formation.""

Cydonia became a priority for the Nasa program. Later another team when to go get pictures of the Face and all they found was a natural landform.

It takes time to prepare the pictures and the launches. NASA sent only 3 teams to go and look at the Face. The reason they did that is because of how much time it could take to prepare for these journeys to space.

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" (paragraph 11).

The Face of Mars looks like landforms we have on Earth. It takes time to perpare for the space missions. Finally conspiracys think NASA wouldn't show the evidence or hide life. Most of these things can even help the mesa of the Face be another landform.   ",2,1,0.8953582048416138

The Face is just formed by conveniently placed shadows. NASA wishes there was life on Mars becase they would benefit from it, so why would they try to cover up something that could get them a lot of popularity and money. Scientists researched this farther and released even better pictures proving it was just a landmass and not an alien artifact. People believe that the clouds could've covered up alien markings but that seems illogical because in 2001 they went back to the face and took more pictures with even higher resolution and found that there were no markings at all, meaning more evidence leaning towards the Face just being a natural landmass and not an alien artifact. It was just a mesa the whole time.

So there is a lot of evidence leading you to believe that the Face on Mars is merely just a natural landmass called a mesa, combined with shadows gives the mass a facelike texture. Lots of research shows you that the mass is very natural and not made by Aliens.            ",3,1,0.9221174716949463
61f7a9c,"When the first photograph of the ""Face on Mars"" appeared in 1976, researchers and the general public lost their minds. The 'face' was a blurry and shadowy photo from the Viking 1 mission. The photo resembled a human face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Dispite all of the scientific and theorietical chaos it created, researchers at the National Areonautics and Space Administration (NASA) discovered that the 'face' was just a matian mesa.

Many people, even today, believe that this natural landform is actually an alien monument. This fallacy lead to many studies, researches, and experiments to find out what the face was. One explaination should cool the heated debated is that NASA is a professional institution built to study this very topic. It is also comprised of educated experts that work to learn and discover more for the rest of the population to learn correctly. However, this is not enough for many people to prove only the plausible.

In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the first portion of the article shows 3 compared photographs. These photographs are all of the 'face,' just in 3 different years. The first photo was taken in 1976, the next was in 1998, and the last one was taken in 2001. Each photo perfectly shows a new piece of the 'face' that was not well understood. The first photo shows what does clearly look like a face in the shadows, but as the photos become more recent, the face receads and becomes what looks like a river, or lava system flowig down the sides. These photographs were taken by separate space missions by none other than NASA. These photos are what fueled the conspiracy theorists theories but only because of the lack of information that they had at the time.

In the article, in paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had taken the sharpest photo of the time. This photo stood to prove what the NASA researchers were trying to say. The photograph itself proved that there were not alien markings on the 'face' and that it was only a natural landmark. This photo showed that the elements that made up the 'face,' were just ""the Martian Equivalent of a butte or mesa."" (12) It showed small elevated spots on the surface that, from afar and in the shadows, a human-like face appeared around all of it.

However, for some headstrong citizens, this still was not enough to prove what the photo really showed. This lead to the 2001 MGS mission to capture yet another, improved photo of the surface of Mars. The team that which took the photo prided themselves on taking the ""extraordinary photo with the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" (10) In paragraph 10 of the article, it explains that in 2001, the resolution of the photo (1.56 meters per pixel) was beyond fantastic compared to the resolution of the 1976 photo (43 meters per pixel). This comparison is enough to show that in 2001, the landmark could be seen very clearly with the human eye and could be clearly made out as just a landform. The photo was clearly just a bit o' rock jutting out of the surface of Mars.

The 1976 controversy over the ""Face on Mars"" was truely a very heated debate. Starting in 1976 when a blurry image of a face on Mars made it's way through the minds of the Americans, the ""Face on Mars"" was concieved to be an alien relic of some sort. Years later, a new photograph produced by NASA in 1998 began to settle long held debates over the face. It proved to many researchers that this startling human like face was only a natural landmark with a coincedental shape and shadow. This did not, however, settle all of the disputes amongst the ammeture conspiracy theorists. To further prove the point, NASA pushed it's limits in 2001 and took an amazingly sharp photo of the land mark. The photo was pure proof to the nation that the fantisized face was only a small mesa on the surface of Mars. Even today some theorists still try to hold their ground in their thoughts, but it will always be known to science as just a martian mesa that caused some commotion.",4,1,0.8879532814025879

The head was aproximatly two miles long and was staring back at the cameres from a region from Mars called Cydonia .

Mission control were suprised at first until they realised it was just another ""Martian mesa"".

Snake River Plain of Idaho , well it has the same natural formations such as Mars. Many people including you believe that aliens created it ,but there is no proof , in contrast aliens have never even been discovered so why conclude they made this natural formation.

However there is a reason why some people may believ that this is an alien making. The cameras that were used that day had trouble getting a clear image because of the cloudy weather that day. So the image is very blurred which may lead to some differnt reasoning on the ""Face on Mars"". NASA try their best to get better shots to prove if it was an alien artifact or not , We felt this was important to taxpayers, said Jim Garvin .

Although , this image would bring NASA biliions of dollars if it had been discovered near an ancient civilization .It was only a natural earth formation caused by natural causes , if there was an earthquake would you think aliens made that to . No , exactly because aliens do not exist as we know it. We have no proof that they exist to why conclude that they had made markings on Mars . Just to prove to conspirists like you that aliens didn't leave a marking NASA went to the same spot they took the first images and and retook them again in better weather conditions. They once again found nothing that would relate to a ""martain marking"".

In conclusion , the ""Face On Mars"" was just a natural formation. This happens in many places on earth too . Which is why you should believe that aliens didnt leave a mark on mars . What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.",4,1,0.8704745769500732

Many people believe that there is other lifeforms living in our solar system like the people who think there are aliens on Mars. These people think this way because there appears to be a landform on Mars that looks like a face, but these people are wrong. The face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform, and just because it is there, does not mean that there has to be aliens up there.

The face looking landform on Mars is just a natural landform, and does not mean there is aliens living on Mars. According to the article, it states that, "" it was only another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia"". This proves that this is not the only time this has happened on Mars, and does not mean that there is aliens on Mars just because of a naturally occuring landform.

Some people thought is was an alien artifact and that means that aliens had to have lived there. The article states that, "" Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact"". So very few scientists believed this was true, which is not very many, and these are people who studied this for a while and only a few think that aliens are living on Mars because of this landform.

The Face on Mars is real because it can be a natural landform on Mars just like we have natural landforms on Earth. Now may I ask a question? How can ailens make a face on Mars? In the picture provided, it seems the face pops out and there is no evidence that a creature could have made a face with no flaws. In the article, a webiste states "" thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.""

I understand that people may have a theory about the face, but hence the word theory. Theory is just a guess with evidence supporting the claim, but is there enough evidence to support the Face? People from NASA have studied the Face since it first appeared in 1976. Since then, people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving it is just a natural landscape.

How did the face appear? There can be many reasons on how the face appeared on Mars. There could have been a storm on Mars that caused the ground to move upright and form the Face. The face could have been on Mars since Mars was created and NASA just never payed enough attention until 1976. I do not believe an ailen created the Face on mars.

Scientists have done studies and research these things unlike other people so everyone should be listening to the Scientists instead of other people who don't know anything about these markings.",2,1,0.8393988013267517
62880ae,"Aproximately about twenty-five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting planet Earth. While trying to capture priceless photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, the camera spotted out a deceiving, mysterious, shadow-like figure that looked similar to a human face. Soon enough scientists discovered that this was just another Martian mesa or as we may know, a natural landform. Although, there was something unique about this landform. It had these keen, unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. The quarrel that many of us can make is whether or not this face we have discovered is simply a natural landform that eroded and formed itself over time, or constructed by the hardmanship of aliens. From evidence and research, we can come to a conclusion that this has to be just a landform. What many people do nont realize is that they are basing their information off of not only psuedoscience, but theories and made up thoughts of what they think took place. For example, the theory that the American Flag was not indeed put on the moon, that it was hollywood editing skills that made it seem like it. This is a connection that you can create knowing that these are simply made up thoughts which is fake science.

Theories may be convincing but take into consderation that there is clearly proof behind the pudding. According to research, it states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equiavalent of a butte or mesa; landforms common around the American West."" If this does not guarantee to float your boat then hear out how silly of what the conspiracy theorists have to say is. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA wold rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" If the face was assembled by aliens in space then NASA would be the ones to want to figure this

and be encouraged to want to crack this code by using real facts and evidence instead of thoughts and predictions.

In a nutshell, the Face found on Mars is simply just a landform. The situation was blown out of porportion for example, it has starred in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery stores for twenty-five years! This has not been the only case where these theorists have came into play. It is more reliable to understand and trust facts from hard research opposed to what's going on in the abyss of someone elses mind. You can bet that this will not be the only false assumptions from conspiracy theorists. Watch out!",3,1,0.7826675176620483

That NASA would like to have this information to them selfs. The supporters of NASA beleve that NASA would come out with their discoverys. Both sides have a piont of but NASA starts their project to debunk these theorsist.

NASA capters this photo of the red plant in the year 1976 and shows the photo to the public. This picture would become big"" it became a pop icon and starred in Hollywood films,appeared in books, and ect. Then contriverse started on this could be and an ancient civilization.""meanwhile,defenders of NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization. This wouldn't stop thorists, not in the slitest bit.

After the surveyor srrived at the plant on September 1997 ,18 years after the program ended. NASA said""We felt this was important to taxpayers"" explained Jim Garvin. On April 5th, 1998 when the Global Surveyor flew over cydonia. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture. This picture was 10 times as better as the original and shows a natural land form.

The picure showed better evidence that the theorist were wrong about an ancient cover up of anything. Garvin said""So,if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egtptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or meas. This debunks all explations of theorists every were. NASA has proven them selfs to not being the bad guys in a cover up.

In conclision NASA releases the picture to the press in 1976. Therists say thats NASA is trying to cover up their findings of this civilization. NASA finds out about what people are saying about a cover up .18 years later they are going back to Mars to take another photo with abetter camra.

62bc176,"Many people believe this very famous ""Face on Mars"" was indeed created by aliens. We've been hoping for explanations of this and possibly another alternative than the Face just being a landform on Mars. Although, after reading the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", NASA had indeed found an explanation that shows the Face is surely not created by aliens, but it is just another natural landform that we have discovered.

First of all, the Face has been discovered as a natural landform because NASA scientists even said, ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just anohter Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Even though the face caused much excitement between the scientists, we as the scientists needed to face the fact after all the research and pictures that showed the Face was not something extravagant the aliens on Mars had created. So even though the Face gained much popularity commercially, it was just another landform like the many other ones on that planet.

Also, finding out their was ancient civilization or aliens currently on Mars would benefit NASA greatly, as it would be seen as a huge accomplishment. The article states, ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" My question is for you, why would NASA try to cover up or hide that they indeed found aliens or life forms creating things on Mars? NASA spent a long time taking pictures and doing research to look at this kind of stuff, even though something like this would be a huge event in all of history. It would become a great accomplishment for NASA and they would definitely want to share what they have discovered. When they first found the Face, NASA gained popularity from commercials and it became an icon. So if the Face was indeed created by aliens, NASA would gain even more popularity, if they thought the face was anything more that a landform after all the pictures and research.

Finally, the area that the Face was discovered in a common place for those landforms. The article says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" Even though it caused a great surprise, the scientists soon realized it was just another landform, which they the sensation was over. Don't worry though, a few scientists did actually believe the Face was an alien artifact, but let me tell you, they were wrong. ""On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camers team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious websurfers were waiting when the imagine first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" So as you can see, those scientist were proved wrong by that picture that proved there was no actual alien monument, as they believed so.

In conclusion, I hope I have convinced you with the evidence from over the years involving the unmasking of the Face on Mars. The Face was not created by aliens because NASA would not hide the information, there is signifact pictures evidence to prove this argument, and the Face was in a common place for things like those to be found, in a place called Cydonia. NASA worked on it for years, trying to find the truth, only to find they had discovered another natural landform. Also, even though some scientists may have thought there could be alien artifacts and it was created by the aliens on Mars, they soon realized what the Face truly was. ",5,1,0.9185003042221069
62e1061,"Many people still believe that the Face on Mars is created by aliens. Some say it's to hard to really know what the object really is. Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, there is many places out west that look like this, and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that the Face, is only a landmark.

Based on the story, Unmasking the Face on Mars, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" When this picture was showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientst. but the people from NASA called it a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head..."" formed by shadows, giving it an ilusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see how it looks like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like somthing, it doesn't mean it is that.

Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn't mean thats what they are, because of looks. The story, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west."" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. it has the same height as one in Idaho. It could have a different face then ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.

The first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all the needs to be a face. The second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, ""the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April '98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze."" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn't taken clearly.

Even though you couldn't see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, ""if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren't able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.

Based on research, and facts from, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't. ",5,1,0.8995259404182434
62f4634,"If it was made by aliens wouldn't it look less like a face? To me it lookes like it was formed like that because you can tell that after so many years it faded away. in 1976 it lookes like a face and then in 1998 it lookes like a normal rock formimg,in 2001 it doesnt even look like a face at all.

Think about it if an alien made it wouldn't it look more creative or more unlike a face,because really the NASA dosnt even know if aliens are real, if they are real it doesn't mean they would make something like a face. you can tell because in the passage it says that scientists figured out it was just another mesa.

you can also tell because in paragragh 3 it says it was created by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. In the passage it says what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a mesa-landforms common around the american west. so it is likley to happen.            ",2,1,0.8521840572357178
62f4cd8,"Ok, so people think that the aliens made the face on Mars or might be an alien territory, but no. If aliens made a face on Mars, shouldn't have they came to Earth by now? They could've ruled us by now. The Face is a natural landform on Mars.

To prove that this was not caused by aliens, NASA reported,"" Huge rock formation which resembles a human head that is formed by shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It is all just an illusion. We have seen some illusions in our past lives in space and maybe on Earth. You think that you see a human in the forest, and figured out that it was a tree.

NASA has send an aircraft or a ship that was called Mars Global Surveyor. The camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing an natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all.

So, if you think that is was the aliens, there's the proof. Aliens didn't create a face on Mars. It was just a landform that web surfers and/or NASA saw. Like I said, aliens should have taken over the galaxy. I guess not. I think they are so nice. You see aliens in youtube videos and movies. Some people think that th video was just edit really perfectly to make the aliens real. Why would the government or Area 51 make this a movie? Are they now spreading the word. Some people think it's real by the theories on what happened on the mountain in North Carolina. Some people in think that an alien spacecraft landed on Nevada. I don't know anything about aliens of course.

There it is, the face is a natural landform on Mars. I have proof that it was not a creation from the aliens. I can't say anything now because I'm speechless. I already said whtat needed to be said in the conclusion. I hope this argumentative essay convinces people to think that the aliens didn't create the Face on Mars. ",4,1,0.9131386280059814
6309006,"No! The natural landform was not made by any kind of alien in Mars. It is just a landform that appended to look like a human face. And if im saying if it was made by aliens there is nothing that proves it to be made by aliens. Heck there isnt any at proves or gives an idea that aliens actually exist. But there is a lot of evidence that proves that the face was made naturally and is just a landform that happened to look like one. A few of them are we sent ""Mars Global Suveyor"" and it showed no sign of alien monument, there was a good picture taken of the area of the landform, and lastly if there was any signs of aliens or their artifacts we would want to know and explore it like you would. i will list and prove in the following paragraphs why it is just a landform.

First, when we sent the

"" Mars Global Surveyor"" it arrived in eghteen years in September 1997. When the Surveyor was flyiing over Mars it found the face and as soon at it was clear we took pictures of it. On April 1998 the Surveyor flew over and took a nice shot at the face. This shot was ten times better the the first shot taken.

secont, Thanks to the picture taken by the surveyor we could now look for small details by the face. For each pixel in the 2001 the image spans ""1.56 meters that compared to 43 meters per pixel."" in the picture you can look three times closer thanks to pixels. That means that if take a picture like that you should be ablie to see big objects for example airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small homes or shacks.

You might say that we NASA are trying to keep things secret from all of you in the publice and that we just want to keep the discovery of aliens to our selfs. But the truth is we don't we want you to know everything we know and we want to find any sign of alien life like artifacts and shacks and technology, but the fact is that the face in Mars has no prove theres nothing by the face that proves that any type of life built it. there was no left over material or any tools left the simple fact is that the face was made naturally and it is a landform like the ones we have on earth. Just this landform happened to look like us like a human.

In conlusion the face on

Mars will and should be considered a landfom. If it was made by aliens we would have found out thanks to all these studys but all of the studys we have made have proven there to be no life on the planet Mars. But I want to challenge you to conduct you own studys think of new ways and send them to us if this is what it takes to prove that there are or arent aliens on the planet Mars then lets work together and prove one or the other about the Face that could be a land form or could be a artifact.          ",3,1,0.8130162954330444
637ba77,"Recently, there has been an issue about a the so-called ""Face"" landform on Mars. People across the world are arguing that the Face was created by aliens. Scientists at NASA are arguing otherwise. I believe the Face was not created by aliens.

First of all, the scientists at NASA want the Face to be made by an alien civilization. The Face being made by an alien civilization would boost NASA's popularity, therefore boosting NASA's budget. With a higher budget, NASA would be able to explore more, possibly even explore the Face. If there was an alien civilization, NASA would have no reason to hide it. NASA would reveal it to the public and most likely do more research. Finding information about another civilization would be a good thing for NASA.

Next, pictures have been taken of the landform. On April 5, 1998, pictures were taken by Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team. The pictures showed a natural landform, not an alien-made monument, which is exactly what NASA scientists expected.

Most importantly, there are natural landforms just like the Face on Earth. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Jim Garvin, who is a cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Quotes from this professional scientist show that a landform exactly like the Face could appear on Earth.

Although some people might say that the picture wasn't clear, scientists have cleared that up. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor was close enough to take another picture. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,"" says Garvin. The pixels in the picture from that day span 1.56 meters each, compared to 43 meters per pixil in the best 1976 Viking photo. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

These reasons show that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens and is just a regular landform. The Face is just as likely to occur on Earth as it is on Mars. It is just a butte or mesa with unusual shadows that make it look like a face. I believe the Face was not created by aliens.   ",4,1,0.8601970672607422
63d70fa,"Do beleive in life on Mars? Many people do, they beleive that there is evidence to back up their theory. Such as the photograph, that was originally taken in 1976, of a rock that supposedly looks like a face. Though scientists know that the ""face"" is only a natural landform on Mars such as a rock.

The rock was photographed three times, in a place on Mars called Cydonia, the photgraphings were in , 1976, 1998, and 2001. Each time that picutre was taken it became more clear revealing that the ""face"" is simply a rock with many shadows. The shadows make the rock look like a face giving and illusion of a nose, eyes, and a mouth.

The photo was released to the public in 1976. This lead many people to believe that there really was life on mars. Many conspiracy theories formed. People believed now more than ever that life exsisted on Mars. Scientists knew this was false, it was merely a mesa, or rock.

Another photo was taken above Cydonia in 1998. This photo was taken by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) unlike that of the 1976 photo which was taken by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. This photo was ten times sharper than the original one. The picture provided even more evidence that ""face""

was nothing more than a natural landform.

Though not eveyone was satisfied because the photo had been taken during a cloudy time on Mars. People believed that alein markings were hidden behind the cloudy haziness of the planet. Therefore in the summer of 2001 the MGS snapped another photo of the ""face"". The camera could capture pyramids, small shacks, or airplanes because the image could capture objects 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

The image revelad no such evidence that life once occured on Mars.

Many people might still be skeptical of the ""face"", but there is not enough evidnece to back up life on Mars. The ""face"" is just another conspiracy of life. Scientists know that the ""face"" is only a rock, or other natural landfrom on mars.            ",3,1,0.871228814125061
642c585,"In 1976 images taken by NASA's Viking 1 have shocked the media. These images show an object on Mars that resembles a faces. These images have surprised the media and cuased a large reaction.

These are images of a mesa on Mars. They are closely related to the mesas we have on Earth. The ""face"" is actually shadows giving the illusion of a nose, eyes, and mouth on the mesa. They released these pictures to the public hoping it would sensationalize Mars. They hoped it would help make Mars more interestion. Well the images did just that. People stared to believ that there was life on Mars. They believed that the face was made by aliens, dispite the research proving it was just an illusion. Conspracy theorist belived that the illusion explanation was just a cover up. Yet, why would NASA cover it up. If this would be real NASA would get an extreme increase in popularity and funding. They would only benefit from it. NASA even took another voyage to prove it was jut a rock formatioon.

Although NASA has proven time and time again that it is not actually a face, people are still esceptical. People believ that the goverment is hidding something from us. These ideas are ludicris. Look at the facts. The goverment or NASA wouldn't benifit from a rock formation as much as they would from a prove of life on Mars. The rumors about the face are just that, rumors.",3,1,0.8754265308380127
6435caa,"There is no ""face"" on the planet Mars in the Cydonia region. I feel that it is people's imagination coming to life in strong arguments. Although it isn't a face, people are still making a big controversy over the Face on Mars.

First of all, in 1976, when the picture was taken, technology wasn't the best, so it could have been some lack of better technology that could've made it look like a face. In paragraph 10, the author states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Also, in paragraph 11, the author says, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" These two quotes state that the improvement of technology has proved that this isn't any Martian-made object.

Secondly, the 2001 camera's high resolution allowed a closer and more evidential look. Again, in paragraph 10, the author states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This quotation's second reason proves that the camera could zoom in closer and get evidence to support that the formation is not a face.

Lastly, the formation is just a natural landform called a ""mesa."" The author says, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" In comparison, paragraph 12 claims, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" Both of these quotes tell us that scientific research proves that the Face on Mars is fake, and that it is actually a mesa.

The Face on Mars in the region of Cydonia is actually a mesa. I feel that the Face on Mars is causing too much of a controversy. I hope that as technology improves, we can get better views on the landform to get better evidence that it is a Mesa and not a Martian-made face.",4,1,0.8158355951309204

is some kind of alien artifact or a natural landform.The enormous head found on mars was nearly 2 miles from end to end, it could have been a mesa, and it has a shadow that makes it look like a face.

In a few days NASA unveiled the photo for all to see. The caption was ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head and a shadow illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth"". The face has become a pop icon and has starred in a Hollywood film. It has been on books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted the grocery store checkouts.

Many scientists belived the face was an alien artifact. photographing became a priority for NASA they launched the Global Surveyor it came into mars Orbit in 1997. Jim Garvin chief scientist explained ""We felt this was important for taxpayers"". The scientist photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot of the face. On April 5, 1998, When Mars Global Surveyor flew over for the first time, Michael and his camera that he pu ton the Mars orbiter snapped a photo ten times shaper than the oringinal Viking photos but reavealing a natrual landform. There was no alien momument after all.

Many skeptics were not satisfied because the face was located at 41 degrees north martian latitiude. On mars it was winter and it was a cloudy time of years on the red planet. The skeptics said that the camera had to peer though wispy clouds to see the face. The skeptics said alien markings could have been hidden by haze.

When the photo was unveield many conspiracy theorist think the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide form us. Mean while defenders of NASA budget wish if there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

In conclusion scientist investigated more into the face and got a perfect photo of the face in maximum quality and showed no signs of writings or sgins of life. Scientits proved that there was no civilization on mars and that there were no writings on the face and it was only a natural landform.

Why don't I believe that wasn't a alien because it could have been a rock that landed and it shaped the Mars into a face in 2001.

So why I don't think aliens made it beacuse aliens aren't real, and they would have did something different probably if they were real. In this essay I don't think it was by aliens because it says "" The caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nise, and a mouth.

I don't think aliens made this because of the pictures and things. They would have showed up and given us a sign that they were there and there are satellites up that takes pictures of all the things and planets.

Although it was disproven that it was a face built by aliens it still makes some people subscribe to the consperocy theories surrounding this Martian Mesa.

Some of the claims hat support that this is a natural occurance and not a monument built by aliens is that when in different lighting it turns from a face to just a normal mesa. But, of course, some people don't believe this and they say that NASA is just trying to cover it up. In responce to these accusations NASA said that it would be amazing if it actually was an alien monument because it would give new light onto exploring the Red Planet.

In the text the author states that to achieve the photo that proved the face was not actually a face took extreme detail to get perfect and that if it was a face or their was any other buidling around the mesa it would be as clear as day. Also, even here on planet Earth there are examples of these mesa such as the one in Idaho that is a lava dome about the same height as the face. So, in conclusion, NASA really doesn't have a reason to cover it up; if it wasn't a face then they don't really loose anything but if it was a face then they would get tons of money for missions to Mars.",3,1,0.8026311993598938

Well we all know that alliens are not real it has been provin many time by other scients. I would unerstand why people would think it was created by these myth cretures, but u also got to think about how land andother things can form tier self in to living fetures like for some exsample. On an sunny day you look outside and u see some clouds and you stare at it for a while. Than all the sudden u see faceses and animals that you reconginize. Like one day I saw a little dolphine in the sky and I got the thinking theirs no wasy their could be a dolphine in the sky. So thats like me saying that thiers a man shaped face on mars tat could have been civilisation on the planet of mars, but dont think wrong i believe that its possabel for people on earth to actual live on that, because theirs other scientists that has proven that to most people and their starting to recrute peopole to actual go to mars. Also their for in the passage it saids it was a huge rock formation like come on now we know a real life humae face is not as huge for it to be spotted from face. Also on mars their is a lot of diffrent shape and sizes and holes like in the moon so its just do univers doing what it does best to form diffrent imagies and diffrent shapes like the was it formed earth and broke diffrent things apart and also land. If u also look in the passage at paragraph 12 it saids in the first sentence that. What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa----LANDFORMS common around the american west. to also make people intrested in the artical the put a. Huge rock formation from mars so theri for their also saying it was made from these mythical cretures called. Alliens and why would alliens want to make a human face in the first pllace if you think about it it actually make sense.

64e21f5,"If i was a scientist at NASA and i had to support thr fact that i think the face is a naturual landform I would empasize that, Life on ars is not likely becuase it has not beeen proven. Just because there are items or land marks that lead to life on Mars does not mean there has been any. Theface is indeed a natrual landform, how? because if you go by the diffrent images included in the article you notice the cleared the images,the face slowly dissapears or fade away. The Face can also appear by things in spaces or objects reflecting unto the mesa.

There are many landforms in Mars and the Face happens to be one. For people to say that aliens are the ones causing it to look like a Face is also a arguement. Why ould support this detail? because of so many life forms on Earth people assume that someone had to make that happen. Perhaps aliens did indeeds have something to do with the ""Face"" , why would they make so clearly and if they did , why did updated cameras show that the clearer the image the face slowly decided to dissapear.

On the other hand there are people who support the fact that the Face is just another landform on Mars. Well as you can tell Mars always had many landforms and The Face happens to be one. How can you prove that? people might ask. Well when Viking caught the images of the Face, ot certainally goes along with the fact that it does look like a FAce but agai the clearer the image got, the face slowly dissaper. When the face does disspear, slowly the landform starts to look like all the other landforms on

Mars or mesas.

Mant people doubt the fact that it is alien, why? because you usually do not see aliens in sight, unless you are watching a movie or reading a book about them.

Aliens could hav eindeed built it , but there has not been an actual sighting on aliens anywhere on Earth, and aliens are usually portrayed as bad people or ting sin movies or books so seeing that a Face on Mars is created by a alien would be kind of frightning because if they are portrayes as bad thing , why would they want a face on a landform. What does that mean?

Now on my side of the story or opinion it clearly looks like a landform and the way it got it's ""face"" was by something reflecting off an object and making it seem like someone had of built that,

But again. those images do not show anything about a face and how could have ""aliens"" buolt something so clearly and so presised. The clues just don't go together.

In conclusion until realistic facts are proven i would stick wit the face that these are natrual landforms and ""aliens"" had nothing to with the fact that they built it. ",4,1,0.8737422227859497

Mission controllers checked twice to make sure it wasn't created by aliens. In the article the author states, the first time we took pictures of the Face we had to go through clouds, skeptics thought that alien markings were hidden by haze. The author also states, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" These two details prove that mission controllers checked twice to make sure that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens.

Scientist figured it's a martian mesa. In the text the author claims, ""Scientists figured it was just another martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egytpioan Pharaoh."" The author also says, ""A lava dome takes the fror of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the Face on Mars."" These two details prove that the scientist figured it was a martian mesa.

NASA was looking for Viking 2 so they could find Viking 1's sister. In the passages the author states, 25 years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars snapping pictures looking for Viking 2, when it spotted the human face 2 miles big staring back at the camera. The author also says, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Scientists have zoomed in on the picture and have proven that the face of Mars is just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Butte's, or mesa's, are landforms common around the American West and are also on Mars. The face of Mars is just a really odd shaped butte and people have mistaken it for alien structures. The face also kind of looks like a butte called Middle Butte in Idaho. People have also said that the face looks about the same height as the Middle Butte in Idaho.

The people at NASA had the first pictures of the butte zoomed out enough that it looked like a face. The NASA camera that takes pictures of Mars is in a wierd position so it doesnt pass the face that much and when it does, its not very close so when they zoom in, the pixels are too big to see. When they actually got a good picture of the face, people started to relize that it was just a wierd landform. When they got a good picture, people probably stopped thinking that aliens made it and just ignored it.

Even though scientists have proven that the face of Mars is just a landform, some people probably just think they are trying to cover it up.

Me as a NASA scientist, I have many pieces evidence to prove that this mysterious face landform was just caused by craters or natural weathring straking the red planet. My evidence will prove a person who believes in aliens creating this face incorrect.

To prove that aliens didn't have any effect on Mars, many natural landforms we have on earth can predict and support that this face was naturally occuring. These images in 1976, 1998, and 2001 remind scientists of the landforms on Earth such as a butte or mesa. To prove this, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) caught images of the face on camera. It was clear it was just a regular landform, not a special, purposefully made alien monument.

The technology we have today makes it clear that the face was just made by natural causes. Our cameras have a clear shot and bigger pixel size digital image. They would have seen any other objects located around the landform like airplanes or pyramids that people believe were made by aliens. There weren't any! The landform looks like a face in ways but it's easy to tell it was made by incoming asteroids on the landscape of the planet. The light from the sun and the shadowing just makes the landform look as if it had eyes, nose, and a mouth.

This evidence given proves a person who believes that aliens created this mysterious face on the red planet wrong. Through the process of unmasking the face, it is clear that natural disasters and weathering happened to create a resemblance of this structure.

Well let me tell you why you are wrong.

First of all, there are no such things as aliens, and if there were aliens they would have already done something to Earth and humans.

This Face of Mars was made natural.

As we already know Mother Nature can do things like this.

In fact, we see natural landforms everywhere.

The passage states,""Global Survey space craft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.""

Juat becuase you find something interesting on a different planet doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

The Man on the Moon for example it wasn't made by aliens, and nobody says it was, so then why should The Face on Mars be any different?

In one of the pitures in the passage it shows the ""famous Face"" and then you can see a hill next to the face.

It doesn't look like anything but a small hump, but its pretty much the same thing as the face, it's made of the same thing, but it doesn't have a face.

This fact proving that it is nothing but a coincedence. From a distance the 1971 viking photo did look as if it was definately a face.

When this image was released everyon at NASA was shocked. They couldn't believe what they were seeing, then later we sent out a new spacecraft with a higher resolution than the old one. It proved that this mystery face was just a hoax. Some might wish that we would have found a secret civilization on Mars but those wishes won't come true.

As we develop more high-tech devices, cameras, and space crafts, We learn that everthing is not what is seems to be. Our newer cameras have about triple the resolution with each pixel spaning at 1.56 meters, while in the original viking photo the pixes are bigger with a span of 43 meters.

Pictures show that shadows from how the camera was located gave the formation the illusion of having eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

Also, the angle of the camera affected the way that the formation was seen.

Other scientists depended on the photographs of Cydonia to prove it was just a rock formation.

The first image that was seen showed that it was a natural landform, and was not created by aliens.

Furthermore, there are many other rock formations that look just like this one in America.

There is also no physical evidence that aliens had anything to do with this formation.

And it is not uncommon to see rock formations like these in places where they could occur.

There is no proof that aliens did not do it, but it is just highly unlikely because it has never been seen before.

To conclude things, the only people saying that this could be an alien monument are conspiracy theorists and they are not as reliable as scientists are.

Scientists have evidence and proof to back up almost all of their thoughts or theories, unlike these theorists.

These people do not have as much experience as the intelligent scientists do, so they cannot be trusted with the information that they give.

6564a7c,"Although many people argue that the Face on Mars could, and or is an alien created artifact, there is much scientific evidence that contradicts this belief. When the Face was first spotted, it was nothing more than an enormous shadow that resembled a head. It had an astonoshing resembelance to an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, which caught the attention of many NASA researchers. After getting an up close view of the Face, everyone realized that this was just a formation of rock called a mesa, or butte, that was very common to see in this area of Mars.

This landform was confused to be a face since shadows allowed others to view it as if though it had a mouth, a nose, and a pair of eyes. NASA saw this as an oppurtinity to excite the public in order to get more people to focus, and discuss about the Red Planet. Once the Face was viewed by others, it became symbolic and it was often used as the topic of many novels and tabloid magazines. This sudden outburt into social media and literature caused people to conspire up a new story. That NASA was hiding the fact that there was an anciet civilazation they discovered, but never told about.

This is obviously false as NASA would benefit from discovering a trace of life on Mars. Very few scientists shared this thought and decided to get the benefit of the doubt by returning to the Cydonia region to reunite with the Face. Once being able to get a clear view of the Face, they got various snapshots. After the image was released to the public, it showed an ordinary landform which contradicted the theory of it being created by aliens.

Skeptic theorists continued to believe that since the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to be able to locate the Face, markings made by aliens were blurred and couldn't be viewed. Once again, NASA traveled to the Red Planet and took a piture three times larger than the original on a cloudless day. This image defended the fact that this wasn't an alien artifact nor a trace of human life on Mars . It proved to be a butte, a common landform found in this region of Mars.

The resolution was high enough that if there were any symbolic markings on the Face or any human related surroundings, they could be seen by the human eye.

The Face on Mars was proved to be a mesa, or butte. Which isn't only common in the Cydonia region of Mars, it is also common in the Southwestern states of the U.S. A Butte found in Idaho is equivalent to the size of the Face, proving that this wasn't an alien created monument.",4,1,0.8651057481765747

Some scientists believed it to be unnatural and made by ancient civilization on mars. The more reasonable option was that it was just another Martian mesa which are commonly found on the part of mars called Cydonia.

Nasa has proven the face on Mars to be a butte or mesa, common landforms that are found on Earth. On April 5th, 1998 the aircraft Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The Mars Orbiter Camera team or MOC took a picture with a way higher amount of resolution than the first one. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

Even after proving the public wrong about this conspiracy many were still not satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter on Mars at the time when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Therefore some people believed that the alien markings were hidden by the clouds.

On April 8th, 2001 whatever hope people had that the Martian face was made by aliens Nasa threw away.

""What the picture actually showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West.""

In conclusion The conspiracy on The Face On Mars was yet only a conspiracy and proven so by Nasa.

Have you ever thought of being a scientist at NASA or have you ever seen the Face on Mars? Well I am a scientist and I have been very lucky to go to space and see the Face in person. It was one of the best experiences that has ever happened to me in life! Some people think that the Face was created by aliens even though there has been many tests and agreements that it is just a natural landform. I belive that it is a natural landform beacuse there is proof that scientists have figured it was just another Martian mesa, there are pictures that proves it could just be formed like that because it is common around Cydonia, and there has not yet been any proof to encourage it was created by aliens.

The scientists and I have done several researches ever since we first saw the Face. Everything has yet led to prooving it is just another Martian mesa. Looking through all the pictures, everything stated that it is just a huge rock formation. The rock resembles a human head with eyes, a mouth, and a nose. I believe that after all the temperatures such as the heat and coldness, it could have caused it to be shaped like that. There has probably even been spaceships that has landed in Mars in search of investigation. The spaceships could have formed these shapes when landing there.

As you probably know, it is very common around Cydonia to have these kind of natural landfoms. Yes, it is common to have shapes and forms that are unusual such as the Face. The only difference in this one was that it had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Theres not really much of a difference if you think about it. It is unbelievable that it's the first time poeple think of an alien doing this art work when they have never thought of this idea when we have found other evidence of natural lanforms like the Face.

There has been plenty of evidence to proove that the Face is just a natural landform, but there is no proove of it to be created by aliens. Looking at the pictures closely, there are no footprints, fingerprints, or marks to show any living life in Mars. If theres no living life in Mars, then how could there be aliens? I want you to think about that. There has not been any kind of creatures found in Mars which is shocking.

Now that I have explained myself of why I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, what do you think? Do you still believe aliens created it?

This is because NASA used more advanced cameras than it did in 1976 to come up with a clearer image of the mesa.

Also, each pixel in the camera in 1976 covered 43 meters.

The camera in 2001 had each pixel cover 1.56 meters.

You can also discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than pixel size.

That's a huge difference in picture quality.

If aliens did make this it would be in the news because come on how many aircrafts are sent into space a day most likly about one ever day. And we also have a satilite up in space and I bet you Countries like Russia, Canada, and probaly even the British have one up in space.

And if something like that happened I would hope one of those satilites would see that happing.

And for all you and me now is that are moon has craters in it. Right? So craters happen ever day so could something like this happen I would think so.

Each of these prove that it is not made by aliens, as cool as that would be. If we go more into depth we will talk about the pictures and research, our landforms, and the multipule in Cydonia.

First off, The face on Mars is a mesa ,thanks to the pictures that where analized. It could also pose as a butte like the one in Snake River Plain of Idaho. The text states that, ""What each picture actually shows is the martian equivalent to a mesa or buttle."" (12) It just shows how much just one picture can prove.

Second, This looks like just another one of our landforms. Like I had said before it is like the Middle butte in Snake River Plain. In the text it states that , ""Thousands of web surfers waiting when the image was revealed on the JPL wedsite, appearing... a natural landform.""

Finally, in Cydonia their are already multiple mesas. The only difference is that this one is more face like. The articale says, "" It was just another Martian mesa, common aruond Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows around it.""(2) If NASA had done research to see about other laandforms and they have proven that their are more than one on the plane, then it must be true.

Most people say, ""The face is bona fide evidence on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide.""

I agree that the shape is a human face shape, but I also believe is just a landform. The reason is that as it stated in the article, the face is to attrack the people. As Technology improved, the picture are showing the real image of the face which reveal to change it shape.

The first reason to support my claim is that the face is use to attrack people, so that the people who made up the idea can earn the money. According to paragraph three it said that,""huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head... formed by shadowss giving the illusion of eyes,nose and mouth."" Following the evidence is that also on paragraph three it say,"" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to enage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This evidence tell me that with the idea of having a human face in Mars, it allowed people to think and believe what they told them.

On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""The second reason is that the face was due to a land form. The evidence not only gave me the idea of how it was form, it also give me the idea of how it reminded them of the a real life thing happen in the United State. We can already agree with this evidence that the idea of the formation for a human face was due to landforms. Also when in a different planet landform are still the same as the earth by how the land change.

There may be live in Mars, and no one know that is true. In any case the Face of Mars might looked like a real human face, but if you look closely at the face that viking take in 2001, it doesn't look like a face. In the picture it show how the landform change it, and that the reason for why there are no Face in Mars. This argument will show you why the Face of Mars is just any landform like you see in earth.                  ",3,1,0.8094514608383179
6687480,"In this article "" unmasking the face on mars"" they are showing us a picture that was taken by a 1976 viking 1 photograph of the face on mars which is just a natural landform. In paragraph 2 scientists firgured it was just another martian mesa, which they state is common around cydonia. Another detail from paragraph 2 they state only because it had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh.

In the Paragraph 3 it states ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth."" Which means that it's just a illusion it wasn't acutually seen or proven to be a human head.

Another fact which is from paragraph 7 it states Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped about ten photos and it revealed a natural landform. In paragraph 9 garvin who is in the Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft he states ""It's not easy to targey cydonia."" which means that they just can fly over cydonia and spot it right away.

Finally in paragraph 12 garvin states what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. In this article ""Unmasking The Face On Mars"" it's just a unproven theory that its a face on mars, there is many details in this article that state that it's just a natural landforms.",3,1,0.8621811270713806
668e285,"In this essay I will convince you that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Some of the evidence that I have that the Face is jusr a natural landform is that i was nearly 2 miles long that would take ""aliens"" quiet a while to create, another form of evidence that I have is that the Vikings missions were done for eighteen years before anyone when back to try and get another picture, and in the text it gives you an example of a nautural landform on Earth the looks a lot like the Face.

In this paragraph I am going to support my claim in the openig paragraph. The first claim that I am going to support is the one about the Face being nearly 2 miles long. If this where to be a creation by aliens don't you think that we would have seen the aliens while they were creating the Face. Also if there were aliens on Mars NASA probably would have descovered them long beofr they had tome to create the Face.

The next claim that I am going to support is the claim about it being eighteen years before another space craft was sent to camture the Face in a picture. Don't you think that NASA would have sent another spacecraft within that month or even year if they thought that the Face was an alien creation. If the Face was an alien creation NASA probably would have sent another space craft sooner because if they found out that there is life forms on Mars that could get them money.

My third and final cliam that I am going to support is that in the text they provide the reader with an example of a landform on Earth that the Face looks like. The landform that the text provides the reader with is ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

That example tells you that aleins couln't have created the Face because they don't know what the landform on Earth looks like.

So in conclusion to my above claims there is no scientific evedence that aliens could have created the Face. A restateof the reasons behind why the Face was not created by aliens are that the Face was nearly 2 miles long and it would have taken aliens a lot of time to create in which NASA could have discovered them, the next resone being it was eighteen years before they sent anyone to get another picture, if NASA really believed it was created by aliens they would have sent someone sooner, the final reason is that there is a landform on Earth that looks a lot like the Face.

66acffa,"Did aliens create an amazing masterpiece on Mars or are you just imagining that they did? Aliens surely do not exist or are for sure not on Mars. It is theretithized that aliens have formed or made an object that seems to look like a human face. I think that aliens didn't do it in many different ways. Such as, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Also, by using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of them. Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Just because we wonder about something, doesn't mean that it's really there.

First of all, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Different landforms that it resenmbles are rivers, volcanos, and mountains. This closely resembles the Snake River Plain in Idaho because of it's swirly indentions. Also in one of the pictures it looks as if it have hot boiling lava bubbling inside of it. And finally it shows high elevations such as the Rocky Mountains. This ""alien created object"" looks very similar to the many different landforms on Earth. This is one of the many reasons why it was not made by aliens but if there were any aliens wouldn't we have known about them by now?

Concequently, using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of the aliens if they lived on Mars. With all of the advanced technology that we have today you would've thought that our satelittes would've taken pictures of the aliens, right? Some reasons why we should've already seen aliens are that we have satelittes that can take high definition pictures, not only but also; we've launched many different programs towards Mars to take pictures but none of them have came back with positive results for aliens. And finally the rovers that we have sent to Mars have come back with little information about vital items needed to survive on a planet. With high definition pictures we can tell if there are any shelters, food, water, etc. on Mars, however there's not. Then again many different space progams hav launched satelittes to take pictures, but there is no vital signs. Finally the rocket propelled rovers that have landed on Mars have came back with little information about items needed to survive. There it is, another good reason and reality why aliens did not create this human looking landform, but it might've just been positioning why we thought that it looked human.

Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Different factors such as the position of the sun, clouds, and or temperature could've made this ""plain"" look human. The sun might've made the shadows of different hills look like eyes and a mouth. The clouds could've covered or angled the sun to make different shadows on the hilly area. Maybe the heat waves deformed the plateu to resemble a human. Nobody knows for sure and unless the exact same situation happens again we might find out, but until then I beleive that it is not possible that aliens made this landform.

It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real.

Everyone wonders what is beyond our reach, but just because you imagine it does that neccesarily mean that it is real? I think that all the examples like it looks like landforms on Earth, we should've seen picture of aliens, and many different factors might have effected our view are definitly reasons why aliens did not create this. Wondering and believing are both good things but if you don't focus on the truth of reality, you will not suceed.   ",5,1,0.8323898911476135

The picture is just the Face of an natural landform. The picture was shaped like an

human, and it had eyes, nose, and an mouth. The ""Face on Mars"" has become popular, they played in fims, and it also appeared in magazines. Some peple thing that it was in a haunted grocerty store. You shouldn't believe that.

In 1976 they had a picture of a Viking of the Face on Mars. Many people, including scientis believe that the Face was an alien. I still say that its not an alien, its just an natural landform of how it was made. Or maybe somebody went up in space, and carved it, you never know.

A couple years ago, the scientist went on a mission. When they went up there, they scanned the plant. They also compare the different photos. In the first photo you couldn't really tell if it was, an alien, or just a natural landform. The picture really shows if the it's equivalent or not.

If you really read the story this doesn't sound real. Some people might think its an alien. Aliens are not real anyway. If you ask me I would say that its an natural landform. The picture has eyes, and human like parts. Its just the Face of an natural landform.",2,1,0.8766632080078125
670088c,"Have you ever see an alien? I bet you haven't, so why would you think that aliens would have built a face on Mars? There are numerous reasons why aliens didn't built this Face on Mars. To start off, it's not even a face, just a natural mesa that's been shaped over time. There's no evedence that aliens have made this mesa, and I'll tell you why.

One reason this Face wasn't made by aliens is the fact that the Face isn't even a Face. This Face is actually about the same thing as a mesa or a butte. It's not a Face built by aliens but actully a natural landform. The Face has most likely been there for years, just only looks like a face when it's shadow sets on it perfectly. It's just a natural landform that's change over time, creating the face everyone saw.

Another reason it wasn't made by aliens is that we have photo evedence. If you take a look at the photo's, you will notice that the one taken in 1976 and the one taken in 2001 are pretty identical. In the 1976 photo, you notice it's very blurry. In the 1998 photo, it's not as blurry but you can't really see a face, but in the 2001 picture, is where you csn tell the big difference. You can clearly see that it's not a face at all, just a natural landform on Mars. You can even tell on the landform where everyone thought the eyes, nose, and mouth went, which is why the illusion made it look like a face.

In this essay, I have proven that the Face on Mars isn't a face at all. The Face is actually the equivalent of a mesa or butte. I also used photo evedence to show that the Face is actually a natural landform. I've also explained why the Face was not made by aliens. I hpe you understand why the Face was just a natural landform and not made by aliens.",4,1,0.8811239004135132
674351e,"The ""Face on Mars"" is really not a a face at all. In fact, it is simply a landform. There is no alien remains or anything like that. It sure does look like a face, but that was merely a coinsidence.

There are many ways to prove this statement. Today, I will only cover a few, though. They are very good points. By the end of this, I think you'll be agreeing with me also.

First of all, to prove this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, no body. If this really was aliens there would be a body to go along with this face. From the picture provided in the article, I can clearly see that there is a face and a fce only. Absolutely no body found. In fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has no body and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face.

The second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien NASA would have found more than one by now. This landform was first discovered in 1976. That is a long time ago. If this truely was an alien that once had life, there would most definetly be more than one. But, there is not. There is only one. This is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform.

The third an final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now. NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Mest). ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" Garvin says.

In conclusion, this is not aliens. This is simply a landform. Even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. It is clearly not an alien. Everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. I hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me. ",3,1,0.839972972869873

What is the face on the Mars? People believe that the face like structure on the moon is an alien artifact. Others beileve it is a natural landform. Here what i think it is.

I believe the face on Mars is an natural landform. Just how the earth has natural landforms like mountain and valleys ect. This landform could be just like the ones here on earth, just in a different shape and size. Just as he said in the passage ""it reminds me the most of Middle Butte in the snake River of Idaho""

which is a natural landform on earth

Mars has been around for many thousands of years. Through those year there could have be a possible chance that the face was made by the coditions on Mars.It could have also been the angle at whivh they shot the picture, there could have been a shadow.aaa        ",2,1,0.9241501092910767
6770d94,"Did you know on Mars there is a face? Some people think it was created by aliens. Other people think it is just a natural landform on Mars. The face on Mars was first discovered in 1976.

When they first saw it it looked like a ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". It was an enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end. When they first discovered it they saw it staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. I am going to be telling you why this is just a natural landform on Mars.

When scientist first saw it in 1976, they thought it was just another Martian mesa which is common around Cydonia. They knew is was some type of landform. A few days later, NASA unvieled the image for all to see. The caption was ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head"". The only reason they said it was aliens, was to get people's attention. That is exaclty what it did.

Eventually on April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia for the first time to check it out. While they were there Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. When the image first apperared on a JPL web site it revealed it was just a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was convinced it was just a landform. Many people still thought it had something to do with aliens. But, how could aliens have done it? No one knows.

On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew a close enough second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,""Garvin stated. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size"", Garvin added. ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" he added. They could tell there was nothing just the land its self. It could not have been aliens.

What the pictures they actually took show is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common in the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"", Garvin says. Garvin ended his statement with,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Coming to a conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Even Garvin, the Mars Global Surveyor said it himself,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivlent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West"".

677371d,"Do you think aliens exist? The face on Mars was not created by aliens, but by the natural forming of the planet. These examples will show how the face on Mars came to be.

The face on Mars was just a natural occurence and not a cover up from aliens. The first example is there are other little landforms right by the face. This exampl means that the face was just another landform and that maybe things formed just right to look semi-close to a human face. The second example is that as cameras got better it started looking less and less like a face. This example states that as cameras got better resolutions they actually found out it was just a mesa. The final example is when they were looking at the face there were misty clouds in the way. This example shows that the clouds could have interfered with the picture causing shadows to hover over the face at just the right angle to give the face a more human look. Finally, these examples show how the face was just a natural occuring landform and not a human-like face.

If aliens in fact did make the face then why does it look more like a natural occuring landform then a face. First example is the aliens couldn't have built a mass structure that is about 2 miles long and wide without building anything else. This example shows that the aliens would have had to leave other structures alike there too. The next example is if the aliens did make the structure they would have had to leave footprints or building materials behind. This example shows that the aliens would have had to leave something behind just like we do at construction sites today. The last example is how could have the aliens built such a large structure in such harsh conditons. This example tells that the aliens couldn't have built in under very cold conditons at night and under barely any atomsphere to breath in. Lastly, these examples show that aliens couldn't have built a structure like that on mars even if it was a face.

The structure was just a landform on mars all this time. The first example is if it was a face it would've been hidden by NASA. This means that if it was indeed a face NASA would have hidden it from the public and studied it greatly. The next example is that again, if it was a face NASA would've greatly beneifited from the discovery. This example shows that NASA wouldn't have shown the public if there had been signs of extra terristrial activity. Finally the last example is that aliens did not make this structure because it would've been an actual alien momument. This example tells that if there was evidence of life NASA claimed that they would know. Thus, these examples show of no alien life on mars.

The conspiracy theorsists might think that NASA is hiding something, but they are wrong because it would have beneifited NASA from hiding it. So all this time people have thought it was a face on Mars, they were wrong because pictures have shown of no humane signs on the landform thanks to better technology.

Do you think the face on mars was created by aliens? I dont, and im going to tell you why the ""Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens. Theres not enough evidence to prove that aliens exist. Conspiracy theorists just want something to obsess about!

The ""Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens.

A few days after the face appeared, NASA unveiled the image for all to see. It also had a caption saying ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giveing it the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth."" The authors said it was a good way to engage the public and attract attension to Mars.They also stated that it looked like the head of an Egyptian Pharoh.

Since they unveiled the image, the ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. It's even been stared in a Holywood film, it's appeared in books, in magazines, on radio talk shows, and in

haunted grocery store cheakout lines for a while! Some people even think the Face is evidence of life on Mars, they say its evidence that NASA woulike to be kept a secret, said conspiracy theorists. All while people who defence the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. A few scientists even thought it was an alien artifact. Capturing photos of Cydonia had become a priority for NASA when the MGS arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions had ended!

Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated ""We felt this was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" On April 8, 2001, a cloudless day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a seond look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,"" said Garvin, ""Malin's team captured an extordinary photo useing the camera's abseloute maximum resolution."" What they captured was a rock formation.

So, as i have concluded, the ""Face on Mars"" was a rock formation with shadows makeing the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth (as i stated earlier). So basically, the Face was an illusion of a face, but in reality, it was just a gigantic rock formation with shadows, but i could see how conspiracy theorists would get the idea of aliens.

NASA has to research and discover such a thing or land format i strongly believe that this is just the land formation the way the rock is shaped and structured.

It could be some alien's work but not quite yet is there time. The land formations can create some of the most beautiful work.

Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Gobal Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eigteen long years after the Vikings missions ended.

Therfore, researchers sent the spacecraft back to Cydonia, on a coudless day, and took more pictures of the Face.

But as the descriprion says in the story ""...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" So NASA the space program, states that it is meerly shadows and hills. I would think that they would be a more trust worthy source than anyone else telling you that this was an alien's doing.

Many people claimed that NASA was trying to hide this information but as the article states ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This is because in part they are probalbly intrieged by the idea of an alien civilization, but also because it would bring in a lot of buisness. The funds that it would bring in would be enourmous. I just cannot think of a reason why NASA would wan't to hide that.

Then again in 1997 NASA snapped another picture of it ten times as sharp as the last one. revealing rocks as can be seen in the picture. And still some were unhappy with the results and asked for more. In 2001, they got their results. NASA caught a picture with ""maximum resolution"" and it is evident in the picture that these are hills. They state in the article ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see waht they were!"" It states in the article that it is like butte or mesa-landforms which can be found in Western America. These shapes are made on earth natrually. So why can't they be made on another planet natrually?

All the evidence points to a natrual land-scape on Mars. Anyone who would read this here would understand that. Every arguement made to disolve this has been met, crushed, and surpassed by another piece of EVIDENCE not claims or theories.

Nature can also make landmarks on other planets as well. This is why the Face on Mars has to be a natural formation.

To begin with, I know that the face is a natural landform because it resembles something in the United States. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, thought that the Face resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also said it was a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars. This shows that even one of the top leaders of NASA's Mars Exploration Program believes that this Face is only a natural landform. Besides, NASA would want to find aliens to prove that there is life on Mars.

Equally as important, nobody has proved that there is any other living thing on a planet except for Earth. Mars is too far away from the sun, and there is very little to no oxygen on the surface of Mars. Even if there is life on Mars, it would be mircoscopic organisms, and they could not build a large structure like the Face. This is another reason why the Face is a natural landform.

And finally, if the Face was made by aliens, then wouldn't there have to be some kind of civilization or living area. The aliens would probably want to be somewhat close to their great formation. However, nobody has located any type of civilization on Mars. With the more powerful that NASA had on the latest probe, they said that you could have see things as small as a shack. Plus, if the aliens built one landmark, why not build another one, but nothing else out of the ordinary has been found by scientists. Lastly, nobody has seen a civilization, so the Face could not have been built by aliens.

In conclusion, there is no strong evidence that the Face on Mars is built by aliens. All the facts point to the idea that the Face is just a natural landform. Scientists took planty of pictures of the Face, trying to find whatever made the Face, but they have found nothing. Besides, there is a natural formation that resembles the Face which proves that they both probably formed the same way. Plus, NASA would want there to be living things on another planet besides Earth, but even they reject the idea that the Face was made by aliens.

It resembled a human head, but it was the shadows that gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and head. Then in 1998 the NASA went back to mars to take more pictures and it turn out be a natural landform. From far away it might have look like a face, but close up it was a mesa. Somepeople wasn't satisfied about it intill we saw what it really was in 2001.

The article states that MOc team snapped pictures 10 times sharper than the oringinaland got a natural landform.

It might have been cool that the ""Face on Mars"" was really real. There are times that we think it was a face but it wasn't took at the right angle to see the face. Somepeople think it was because of the time and date when the picture was taken. They say that the alien markings were hidden by the haze. On a cloudless summer day MGS drew close enough for a second look. When they took the picture on montier it shown that it was lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.

The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. When the ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon. Alot people thought it was a actually face. They might just send another drone to take another picture just make sure its an natural landform. In my opioion I did not what it was intill I read this article. Now we know that the Face on Mars wasn't a face after all.         ",3,1,0.9169609546661377
68c37d4,"This Face from Mars is just a natural landform. It can't be created from aliens because aliens do not exist. Also, no one has ever seen a real alien before. They could just be making this up for the entertainment and attention. The Face even looks like a human head. I can prove that by the evidence that NASA has.

The Face even resembles a human head. There's shadowing that makes the Face a natural landform. The shadowing gives illusion of eyes, a nose, and mouth. According to paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of web surfers all over the world were waiting for the image to appear on a JPL web site. It revealed that it was a natural landform and not an alien monument.

It may look like the Face was created by aliens but it is really doubtful. There is not that much evidence that it could've been an alien's marking. Perhaps, it could've been the wind and water making rocks collide to form the Face. There could be missing evidence that NASA might've not catched, but NASA does have evidence that can say it was just a natural landform.",2,1,0.9149115085601807
68c3908,"Have you ever heard about the face on Mars? Well I have, let me tell you that it freaks me out. Do you think that the face is actually a face?

A few days after NASA sent Viking 1 to Mars to take pictures, they got back photos of a face. Not just any face, it was a human face. Not only is this crazy, it's impossible. It's impossible because we spent a lot of time and money reaserching if humans can go live on Mars. And it has been scientifcally proven by us that no human can live on Mars, so for that reason I don't know how that human face got there in the first place.

I know that some people think that maybe aliens are the ones who made the face, and you may be right. In some cases though, while we we'er reaserching, we would have noticed already. What we think it is is a natural landform. I know that it sounds crazy, but it is a possibility. It would make more sense if it was a natural landform.

If you can't decide if it's a face, aliens, or just a natural landform, then let me take some details from the article to support my idea. One detail is that when scientists found out about the figure, they knew that it was just another Martian mesa. They are common enough around Cydonia. When the pictures were released, it revealed a natural landform. It turns out that there was no alien monument after all.

Dou you believe me know? All of theses details add up to only one solution, which is that it was only a natural landform. I couldn't make this decision without proof, and now that I got it, I can prove to the world that there is nothing but a landform.",3,1,0.8997951149940491

NASA talks about how a spacecraft was circling the planet mars snapping possible landing sites for another spacecraft. When it suddenly spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face it seemed to be smiling back at the cameras.

The likeness face of a human most of been a rock formation as said in the article or a landing of an spacecrft or even from a take off but there so no such thing as aliens that would do that or they don't even exists. They even mentioned in the artilce how the cameras on board of MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face clearly but skeptics a different thing. That pobably aliens makings were being hidden by the haze. Which were not likely it could of been the air,because the human like face was located in the north martian latitude where it was already winter. It could of been the breeze from the snow.

Who would think that aliens would do that if they knew we were going to spot it evenutly. The picture that was taken in 2001 was more bigger and more proseize on what we would of been looking at then it was in 1976. The picture that was taken in 2001 made people see that there was nothing to worry about and that it was just a rock looking like a face.

68f7f6e,"Unmasking The Face

A lot of people lately have been suspicous of my company NASA. While I don't agree with them, I do see their side. The general public has all reasons to be suspicious torwards the ""Face of Mars!"" Sounds like something from ""The Twilight Zone."" Well, Mars, though so barren, might has well be considered the earth's twin sister... or brother. The two planet's sufaces have shown some interesting simularities, like water remnants and climates. Not to mention volcanoes. This is where we find the reason behind the face of Mars!

On our planet earth, we have land structures called ""Mesas."" These elevated lands are found in the ""American West"", where the surrounding deserts (used to be oceans in theory), are now filled with canyons, rock flats, salt flats, mesas, and other forms only found there. Mars might as well have a northwest region where one could find earthlike simularities. This may as well be the reason behind the face. Also, one should note that the shadows may be rocks making a shadow from the sunlight. Another logical explanation to look at France. Shaped like a boot, it is just a land form that naturally occured, looking like something we know.

My company would also like to state that this really ""isn't"" a cover-up. In true fact, the discovery of other life or remnants of one such time would be positive to us, and to our projects. So, say what you want. Believe in what you think, but we at NASA belive this isn't alien. Just another simularity between Mars and Earth.                                                                      ",3,1,0.789314329624176
6942868,"Have you ever heard of ""The face on Mars?"" If so, what is your opinion or theory about it? Do you think it is an ancient body part , or made by aliens? I am going to share my theory with you using actual evidence.

First of all, if the face were some kind of artifact, NASA would benefit from it, and would make a lot of money off of it. If it were a human being at once where would that human get food or water? Space has zero gravity so all of their water would automatically freeze, and there is also no oxygen so where would the food grow, or develope without it? In paragraph 10, it states that after taking 2 photos already (which they didn't notice anything odd about), accusations got so crazy that they had to take a third and still saw nothing unusual!

In paragraph 1-2, it explains how NASA figured the figure was ""just another Martian mesa"" (which, by the way happens to be very common in the region of Cydonia.

If NASA had no explanation, or any idea of what it was I understand that people would throw out wild and crazy accusations, but however in paragraph 3, the textual evidence suggests that the ""eyes and nose"" part of the figure was an illousion from shadows, which is a reasonable or understandable accusation.

Plus, lets face it media hypes everything up , and over exaggerates constantly. As said in paragraph 5, ""the face of Mars"" showed in a Hollywood film, books/magazines, radiotalk shows, etc. People with no knowledge of space (such as a movie director) has no room to come up with accusations.

My conclousion, is that the figure is a natural landform, and that people need to stop making things sound more extraordinary then they really are.    ",3,1,0.8419848680496216
6959d73,"I promise you, this landform on Mars called ""The Face"", is just a natural landform. The only picture that really looks like a face is the picture NASA took in 1976, now we have better technology to show the landform better. A few reasons why we now know that it is just a natural landform are: scientists figured out that is was just another Martian mesa and NASA took another picture in 2001 where it shows the landform in high definition. To learn more about these things, keep reading.

My first reason is soon after the 1976 picture was taken ""scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia."" Now I know what you are going to say, ""What made the landform look like a face?"" The reason the landform looks like a face is because this mesa has ""...unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptiam Pharoah."" After this got out, most people who still believed that it is a landform created by aliens said that it was taken on a cloudy day in Mars and ""...perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.""

My last reason is that when they went back to see the face later on a cloudless day in 2001, the picture revealed that the landform was just a butte or a mesa common around the American West. ""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" After this picture was released most alien believers, believed NASA.

In conclusion, I hope you realize that this Face is just a mesa and not a alien form, although it is okay if you do. I am not here to change you opinion. NASA has spent years and years studying this landform. People should not always listen to conspiracy theories, they are not always right. Through all of this proof they have, I sure believe them that this is not an alien created landform, it is just a mesa or butte.",4,1,0.8823384642601013
698fc7b,"I know for a fact that the Face on mars is not an alien artifact. Instead i know that it is just a normal landform. One of my reason for saying that is simple,on paragraph two it states""Only this one had an unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh,""but that is not my only reason for saying it is just a mesa. I will be explaing why i think that this landform on mars is just a natural landform.

First,i will continue to explain the shadows that gave this landform a face. On paragraph 3 the article states that the landform was given shape by shadows. the face parts the shadows gave were eyes,mouth and a nose. Also on paragraph two the article tells us that this landform was just another Martian mesa,which was common enough around another planet called Cydonia.

Next,i will be explaining the three diffrent pitcures that were taken,and how the (moc) knew how it was just a regular landform and not an alien artifact. On paragraph seven it tells us how the second time they took another pitcure of it,but with a better camera. Many people were very anxious to see teh first image appear on a JPL web site,revealing that it was just a natural landform.

That's not all,one paragraph eight,it states""but not everyone was satisfied"". After that on paragraph nine mission controller looked at the face again,but it was not easy finding it,so they searched for the face until they found it again on April 8,2001. Then the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look,they took the pitcures using a camera's absolute maximun resolution. If there were any objects like Egyptian-style pyramids you could see what they were.

Due to new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft, We now know the Face on mars is accually a mesa.

Many people thought the image taken from the Viking spacecraft in 1976 was a face in the surface of mars made by an acient civilization. Although many people were fooled by the image many scientists were skeptical about the idea. Because of all the confusion, on April 5, 1998 Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the one that Viking had taken. The picture that was taken in 1998 revealed a natural land form. Not everyone was satified. On april 8, 2001, Malin's team decided to take another look at the Face on Mars. This time his team captured a photo of the landform using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. What the picutures showed was that the Face on Mars was a Martian equivilant to a mesa.

The Face on mars was mistaken for a hand made landform that was made by a Martian antcient civilization. Now we can see that it is nothing more than a natural landform.",3,1,0.8618054389953613
69f0465,"The Face on Mars has been a pop icon for years. Many people believe that the Face on Mars is made by aliens. The Face on Mars is a natural landform and was not created by aliens. The evidence that proves this is true is there is another landform just like it on Earth and there are detailed pictures that show it is just a natural landform.

The first evidence that shows it is just a landform is the fact that there is another natural landform like that on Earth. The picture shows an equivalent to a butte or messa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. The text says, ""'It reminds me of the most Middle Butte in the Snake Plain of Idaho,'...about the same height as the Face on Mars.'""

This quote is giving a clear example of someone saying that the Face is like a natural landform on Earth. If it is like something that is made on Earth naturally, that means it could probably made naturally on Mars too. There is another great piece of evidence showing that it is a natrual landform.

Another piece of evidence that proves the Face is a natural landform is that there are detailed pictures that show it is all natural. In 2001 NASA could take pictures with each pixel thats spans 1.56 metes, which is very detailed for the technology we have. The text says, ""'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'"" This example goes to show that NASA took a picture using the best resolution they had on their cameras to show and see the fact that it is not alien made and is all naturally made.

Many people believe that this face was created by aliens, and its not just a natural landform. But I can almost prove to you that this ""face"" was not created by aliens and is infact a natural landform.

First, If the face-like landform was created by aliens why would that be the only mark? Usually if the face was created by aliens there would surely be a way bigger mark. As well as there would be plenty more marks surrounding that face. This proves that this mark is simply just a landform.

Also, there is plenty of life-like landforms created with the surface of the area. Just so it happens to be on a planet doesn't mean there has to be a wild explanation to this landform. There is life-like landforms that sometimes look a a full body and there are some that look like half of a body. Many of those landforms have been scientifically proven to be just a landform. Also, with all the human shaped landforms we have all of them should be claimed to be created by aliens! Once again, there is no way this landform can be created by aliens. Yes it is indeed unusual but if humans cant travel to Mars how would aliens be able to travel to mars? It's impossible for aliens to make this landform.",3,1,0.8698686361312866
6a0cbec,"We are all human beings. We all have some different opinions and some same opinions. The interesting debate was about the Face on Mars. I am here to tell you that the Face is just a natural landform.

I have reasons to why the Face is just a natural landform. First, aliens are not scientificly proven to be real. Therefore, the Face could not have been an alien artifact. Second, the face appear that a person is inside the moon trying to come out and that is impossible for someone to be inside the moon. Finally, no one could have been to Mars and created that Face because it would be stated on the Internet on who created it.

There are numberous of evidence of why the Face is just a natural landform. First, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos revealing it as a natural landoform. In addition, the camera that Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo of using the camer's absolute maximum resolution. Futhermore, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compare to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Finally, the picture that Malin's team capture showed that it is Martina's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

Others say that the Face on Mars was not a Martian's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms. Some people believed that it was from an alien artiface. Others like conspiracy theorists said the evidence that NASA would rather hide.

There are reason why the Face on Mars was just a natural landform. This eassy helps you to rethink your thoughts of what it really is. There are logoical supports and evidence. The Mars is an interesting place for a planet.",2,1,0.8919671773910522
6a28e7c,"A face on mars! NASA found a face on mars that is said to be a natural landform but many think it is alien creation. There are many reasons that shows that claim of it being an alien creation is false for example there have been 3 pictures of the ""face"" the face looks different in each, it is a lava dome, and there is not a reason for NASA to keep it a secret.

In the article they give 3 pictures to look at and in each one the landform looks a little different because of the new advance technology. For example the picture in 1976 yes it does look like a face but that could be just because of the low camera quality at the time of the picture taken. The picture could've been anything at the time a rock formation is and was the logical explanation for this. For example in the second picture taken in 1998 the landform is a little blurry but easier to see and in this picture it doesnt resemble a face at all it was revealed to be a natural landform. The example shows that NASA confirmed that it is just a natural landform and is not an alien creation. It does not even look like a face in the sharper picture take in 1998. The last example is the picture taken in 2001. Many thought that the picture taken in 1998 was not proving anything because it would have been winter in mars so the picture had to be taken through wispy clouds so they went again in 2001 they went on a cloudless summer day. For example in the passage it says,"" Malin's team captured an extra ordinary photo using the camera's absoulte maximum resolution."" The example shows that NASA took an amazing clear photo revealing that it is just a land form.

In the article there are three different missions. In the first mission they fiqures it was just another common Martian mesa. For example in the text it says,"" Scientist fiqured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows."" The example shows that they said that it is just mesa with unusual shadows. The next mission sais that it is indeed a natural landform. For example in the story it says,""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial viking photos and posted on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform."" The example shows that the new cameras showed that it was just a landform but that still wasnt enough evidence to some. The third mission was in 2001. For example in the text it says,"" a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" The example shows that this mission was on a cloudless day so there would be nothing blocking the view of the landform. All three missions they all agreed it was just a natural landform

Why would NASA want to hide it and there is enough evidence that it is just a natural landform There would be no reason to ""hide"" if aliens were found. For example in the text it says,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" The example shows that if there was a civilzation they would not keep it a secreat because they could get more money to study it and in the long run more money for discovering it. Another example is in the story it says,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes ont he ground or Eqyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The example shows that if there was ancient civilization there they had to live somewhere and we would be able to see their shacks. The last example is in the story it says,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The example shows that it is a butte or mesa and it even looks like the middle butte in the River. There is no way the ""face"" is anything but rocks.

In conclusion there is no evidence what so ever that the landform is an alien creation. There was though 3 missions that have evidence showing that it is a landform, there were three different pictures,and there was no reason for NASA to hide this dicovery. The ""face"" is just a natural landform. ",6,1,0.9097763299942017

Paragraph ten and eleven of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" As rule of thumb, you can discern in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""" This leads me to belive that there is nothing but that natural landform on the Face of Mars. With these images it says you can see the tiniest thing as a shack, so I am positive that we would see any evidence that aliens were there.

The landform actually shows the Martian eqivalent to buttle or mesa----landforms common around the American West. This face on the surface of Mars resembles many of those on the Earth, which we know were not created by aliens. """"It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain in Idaho,"" says Gravin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."""" These lines in paragraph twelve show that there is another landfrom, on Earth, that has formed out of natural causes such as lava. The Face on Mars could just simlpy be lava that has caused the surface to rise.

Many conspiracy therorists say that it could be aliens and NASA is just trying to hide the evidence form the people. Yet in paragrpah five it states, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This shows that if this was caused by aliens, that it would be benifical to NASA. Few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, but there was no actual proof that it was. There were only pictures that clearly showed that there were no signs of aliens.

Although this Face on Mars is a big deal, I believe that it is just a natural landform. Images that have been taken show no sign of aliens or ancient civilizations. There are also many landfroms on Earth just like this Face on Mars. Last but not least, the theory that NASA is keeping information from us is not true because the Face actually being aliens or an acient civilization would only benifit them.

6a43464,"I know people think the face on Mars is something that was created by some kind of life, but really it is not. This is acually just a landform. The face was found in the region of the red planet called Cydonia. It is very hard for NASA to get the picture because they have to angle the satalite just right. I am not trying to be pestimistic but, NASA has seen landforms on Mars before and the article says,""the mouth, nose, and eyes are allusions caused by shadows"". The facts just dose not add up to their being life on Mars.

This face is just a landform. There are many ways this landform could have happend. For example, a duststorm, astroids crashing on the planet, or underground volcanos. These are all examples of how the face could have been created. The article says it was caused by butte or mesa. Time for everyone to come up with a new theory!

This face was found in the area Cydonia. One day the aircraft Viking 1 was circaling the plant and found the face. Could you imagine the scientist face when the aircraft reported it back. A few days later they released it to the public. Lots of people were confinced that it was caused by some kind of lifeform, but really it was not.

It was hard work for NASA to get the picture because they had to rotate the aircraft at 30 degrees. This was not easy because if they went to far Nasa would miss the face. If they did not go all the way around Nasa would still miss it . It had to be perfect. It could have been 29 degrees, one of, but it did not matter it would still miss it. It had to be perfect. NASA finnaly got the picture and proved that there was no lifeform.

The nose, mouth, and eyes are caused by shadow illusions. They might have been formed by astroids crashing there, but are most likely shadow illusions. These illusions are caused when the Mars acsis are tillted a certain way and the sun hits it. This is most likly how the shadow allusion happened. This is what scientist says caused the illusion.

In conclusion there were many ways for this landform to happen. Do not think this was caused by some kind of life form because there is not enough proff. There are many ways this could have been formed. For example. A dust storm, or underground volcano the list goes on. It may never be solved what caused it.

6a5eec3,"Mesa on Mars

Who or what created this ""face"" on Mars? Was it aliens, or just nature doing its thing? The answer has been debated ever since it was discovered and the truth has been found. Although there's proof out there like the picture that was taken ten times better than the Viking's pictures, skilled scientist themselves don't even think it could be made by aliens, and there are similar landforms on Earth some people still find ways to argue. These people might say ""the markings were hidden under the haze, but just as much as that could be true it could also be wrong. This ""face"" was created by none other than Mother Nature herself.

To start, the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 were much clearer than the original Viking pictures and unmask the face for what it really is. In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it states, ""...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos."" To illistrate, the article is saying that this new picture was so much better and much more revealing. The day this picture was taken (April 5, 1998) was completely cloudless. This means that there couldn't have been any alien markings hidden somewhere. Garvin said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size..."" He's hinting that even small things that show us there was civilization there could've been seen in this picture. To conclude, the new picture was proof to the world that this was just a landform.

Not only did a picture tell us this was no sign of alien life on Mars, but so did skilled scientists. When the picture was first taken, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" We all know that scientists know their stuff so why doubt them? Their first intsinct was that it was just another landform, so why can't we all just agree with them and get on with our lives to worry about something more important? Even the caption for the picture (when it was released for everyone to see) noted that it was just a huge rock formation. So why can't we just see this ""face"" for what it is?

Lastly, there are landforms on Earth just like it. They're called mesas or buttes. Garvin says that "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars."" If these landforms can naturally occur on Earth can't they also occur on Mars? Garvin sees that this landform is just like something we have at our own home.

Some people might say that when the picture was taken of the ""face"" in 1998 that it was probably cloudy that day and some alien markings were probably just covered up by the clouds. They must have done a lot of research because normally April is a cloudy time on the Red Planet, but that day was completely clear and ""sunny"". These people might just be the kind who believe in the supernatural and say that they've been ""obducted by aliens"". There is much more proof to this face being a natural landform compared to it being a alien made landmark. Where one side would say that ""scientists don't believe there is a chance of this"" the other side would say it was cloudy the day that picture was taken. Overall, there is no excuse for the fact that this is naturally occuring.

All in all, this face is a natural landform that has nothing to do with extra terrestrial life on Mars. There is proof behind it like the picture taken in 1998, the fact that actual scientists don't think there's any chance of it being alien related, and there are landforms like this one on Earth called a butte or mesa.

As the artice ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" said the creature or ""alien mask "" was very large. Planet Mars is not nearly big enough to have creatures with the head size of a whole mile to fit. Just think your body is much more bigger than your head. A head that steratches two miles ear to ear in a very large head, just imagine how large the body would be!

Over time land can begin to crak or break. Something could have been going on inside Mars' crust ,for instece here on Earth we have earthquakes, that could have happened on Mars. It has been said that it is common for figures to start to appear from a region in Mars called Cydonia. Not all of the figures have the apperace of a human face but dont you think if it were an alien it woukd have looked very differant than a human? It has been scintifictly proven that aleins don't exsist.

For Things

to apperar on Mars' surface is normal as it was stated in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". Therefore I do not know what makes people think an alien has just magicaly apperared on the face of Mars. For thousandes of years scientist have invented ways to look at planets, take pictures of them, even get a little sample of the planet. With that being said scientist have checked Mars inside and out up and down and after many years of reaserch and testing they have still never spotted a alien.

be fit to provide a home for a whole community of them the planet would be much to small.",2,1,0.7410635352134705

Cydonia has no life living there. It became main priority to NASA in September of 1997. This Red planet became the priority because they have captured a photo of what looked like a face. Although int he passage scientist state that they thought it was just anouther Martian mesa.

Back at the controllers Jet Propulsion Lab the passage says that the face apeared on there monitors. It was a sensationto the lap and the scientist even thought it was shortly lived. Common around Cydonia they thought it was just anouther Martian mesa. After afewdays NASA unveiled the image of the face to the puplics eye.

The picture of the face on Cydonia shows that it was/is equivalent to a buttle or mesa. Jim Garvin said "" It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""At one point Garvin also said the dome takes the form of an isolated mesa, almost the same height as the face. If there was aliens on the Red planet you could see them. A picture taken was able to be as clear as possble.

I see where people would think the face was made by aliens. Yes, we don't know if there really is life on Mars. Some scientist belive the face was an alien artifact. Skepticals said perhaps alien markings were hiddenby a haze. But, there will not be life on Mars until NASA says so.

Well thats how a lot of people were thinking when NASA revealed the picture of the Face on Mars. However thats not true. NASA has proven in so many ways that it´s just a natural landform, but of course some people think that it´s not natural at all.

First, NASA was very suprised to see something like that on the camera of Viking 1 spacecraft. But that went away really fast. ¨Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa,common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows made it like an Egyptian Pharaoh.¨(2) This tells you that it´s just a natural landform. Not a alien artifact .

Also, NASA wanted to go see if it´s a artifact or just a natural lanform. ¨Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.¨(7) This tells you that they never found an alien artifact on April 5,1998. All they found was a natural landform on Mars.

Finally, since not everyone was convinced that it was a natural landform, NASA decided to go back and get an even clearer picture of the Martian mesa. This time they used an even stronger camera to show the world that NASA is right.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,¨ he added. ¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!¨(11) This can tell you that NASA was trying to tell everyone that their cameras are good enough to spot and see if it´s just a natural landform, so now you shouldn´t be complaning about the pictures.

All of this evidence can tell you that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform, not a alien artifact. Their are still a lot of people who think that martians do exist and they will think anything that is not normal on Mars is martian. However there is no martians on Mars. What do you think?

6ae69c0,"While most people believe the ""Face"" on mars was just a natural landform there are also people who believe it was created by aliens. Those people believed it was an alien artifact that was seen in the photograph taken above Mars by Viking 1 during 1946. But there are many peices of evidence that support the idea of the ""Face"" just being a natural landform.

For starters, when the ""Face"" was first seen on Cydonia, Mars, it was photographed by Viking 1 on 1976, which during that time cameras weren't as powerful as cameras now so the picture quality back in 1976 was blurry compared to today's photos. The '' Face"" was actually just a Martian mesa which is a lava dome, which are common in Cydonia. Soon after, scientists concluded "" it was a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" And if the ""Face was actually created by aliens NASA wouldn't have told the public since it could've caused public panic, but instead NASA used the ''Face"" as a way to attract the public's attention towards Mars. So in the end, the ""Face"" did bring much attention to Mars which was NASA's intention.

While conspiracy theorists believe the ""Face"" was real evidence of life on Mars, it was actually not, defenders of the NASA budget confirmed it when they said that they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Even when few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA. So on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Then, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a picture which was ten times sharper rhan the original Viking photos. And so, the Face was confimed by Micheal Malin and his Orbiter Cameria (MOC) team to just be a natural landform.

But still again people were not content since the Face on Mars was located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998, which was a cloudy day. And so, the camera in the MGS had to take a photograph though clouds to see the Face which skepics still said ""alien markings were hidden by the haze."" So once more, on April 8, 2001, which was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the MGS or the Mars Global Sirveyor grew closer until it was 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. The 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

In conclusion, the photo taken on 2001, finally confirmed that the Face on Mars was really a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. So in the end, the Face was never created by aliens but it was just a natural landform.                        ",4,1,0.8925188779830933
6ae7907,"NASA has recently been discussing what is believed to be a face on mars. Some people think that this is some kind of alien marking. The essay says, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""(paragraph 2) This may convince certain people to believe that there was once life on Mars.

While it may be true, the essay does not say anything about anyone actually getting on Mars to see if it was really just a rock. Maybe there were bones from a human body attatched to the head. Also in the essay it states, ""although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.""(paragraph 6)

As a result, the essay also said ' ""we felt this was important to taxpayers,"" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.""(paragraph 6) So this statement could be implying that they could be making stuff up just for money. If they put that in the newspaper everyone would want to buy it, which would result in making a lot of money.

In addition, the essay says, ""only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""(paragraph 2) this evidence from the article supports my claim and says shadows made it look like something. It could also have been the way something was reflecting off of it.

In conclusion, I believe that this thing was just a natural landform. Many of us have seen weird shaped rocks sometimes we just dont pay attention.

6af0db6,"Many people may believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, but research claims it's something not as exciting. NASA has been researching this ""face"" for many years. Their studies and pictures have concluded that the Face on Mars is a huge rock formation. Even though scientists have proved this theory, people still believe otherwise. It all started in 1976 when NASA unveiled the image for all to see.

NASA found a huge landform made of rock on Mars in 1976. The landform was found on a region of Mars called Cydonia. This landform came as a surprise to everyone. Large rock formations were common in this region of Mars, but something stood out to NASA when they came across this rcok formation. This landform looked like a giant face. Scientists didn't know if it was an alien artifact or if the shadows and the way the rock formed just made it look like a face. There was no way to tell other than the photo's taken from space. NASA had to keep investigating this to come up with an explanation for this ""face"" on Mars. So in 1998 they took another picture of the rock formation that was better quality. They still couldn't tell what it was because it was very cloudy on Mars the day they took the picture. They had one more shot to get a good image of the landform. In 2001, NASA took one last picture and they found out what the rock formation really was.

Just as they had predicted, it was a mesa. Which was common for the area on Mars where they found it. Even though scientists knew it was a mesa, conspiracy theorists still believed it could be an alien artifact. There are many signs that prove that this rock formation is not an alien artifact. First of all scientists have ruled it out as an alien artifact. They have done research on this ""face"" for over 20 years and they have proved it's a huge rock formation. People have always wondered how and why the face appears if it's a mesa. Well the face is created by shadows. These shadows give the illusions of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Scientists have also told us that things in a digital image are 3 times bigger than their actual pixel size. This tells us that if there were some type of pyramid, alien object, or airplanes on the ground we would be able to see them.

The Face on Mars will always be a controversy to some people, but scientists have proof of what the face actually is, a mesa. The pictures you see are actually showing a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. These rock formations are commonly found on Mars and on Earth. So even if you still believe the Face of Mars is an alien artifact of some kind, you can at least know Earth and Mars have something in common, huge rock formations.       ",3,1,0.8926191329956055

I think the face is just a landform bacause the picture is actually showing is a mesa lanform that can be mistaken by a face.

The face on mars can be related to some things on earth like the middle of the butte in the snake river plain of Idaho.

When someone had made the picture larger the face just looked more and more like a mesa or a butte landform. Micheal malin went to take more pictures which was more clear and he found out that it is just a natural landorm.

It kind of reminds me of pyramids that the Egyptains built. There are pyramids on Mars and there is proof of that. Yes, aliens COULD have built this, but I don't think so. There have been sightings of ""aliens"" on Earth, but this does not mean that aliens built this. Do you have proof that aliens built this? No; there is no proof that aliens built this.

Nasa took the picture of the landform and wanted to attract attention to Mars. According to the story, Nasa unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illustion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.""

The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars, and it did. (Paragraph 3 and 4)

On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform not an alien monument. (Paragraph 6 and 7)

Another fact is that we have many landforms like this in the United States. The story states that, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Survetor drew close enough for a second look. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

In 1976 viking 1 was snapping pictures so that viking 2 could land while doing that it snapped a picture of a landform that looked like a face. Many people thought that it was a face but it wasn't. In 1998 they took another pivture but this time it didn't look like a face it looked more like a landform on the ground. Many people thought that the landform was created by aliens many others thought that it was made just like land forms on earth.

People still thought thet they were made by aliens many other people disagreed on it until 2001 when they took the final picture and they saw that it was actually a landform Garvin said that it reminded he of snake river of Idaho.

So after that happened mny people saw the truth about the face on mars and completely forgot about it.

6bf18d4,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a landform seen in photographs of the surface of Mars. Some people believe that this landform is proof that alien life exists and that this landform was created by said aliens. However, there is plenty of information to disprove this. This information is found in the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars.""

The article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" states, ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say some conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This statement suggests that NASA would have no reason to hide evidence of alien life, as this would benefit NASA greatly. If NASA had discovered evidence of alien life, NASA would have presented it as such.

Later on, photographs were taken of the landform once again. However, the camera had to ""peer through whispy clouds to see the Face."" Because of this, some skeptics believed that alien markings were hidden by the haze, which is shown in the quote, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by the haze."" In response to this, another picture was taken on a cloudless day, showing that the Face was nothing more than a natural land form.

This landform is similar to some of the landforms on Earth, as shown by the quote, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Another quote to prove that the Face is similar to formations on Earth is, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This suggests that the Face could have been formed much in the same way as the Earth formation mentioned in the quote.

The fact that, in the photographs of the fornation, there is no evidence to prove alien life is also a factor to consider. A quote by Garvin shows why this is an important peice of information to consider. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were any objets in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This proves that because no evidence of alien life can be seen in the pictures, means that there is none. In these pictures, claims Garvin, you could discern objects easily and tell what they are. If so, NASA can easily confirm that this land formation is natural and that there is no evidence of alien life.

Thus, the Face on Mars is a natural land formation. If it was evidence of alien life, NASA would have presented the information as such. NASA would have then pursued the lead that proved alien life exsisted by attempting to find this alien life or more evidence to prove that alien life exsisted. NASA would have beneiftted greatly if the Face had been created by alien life forms. This formation is also very similar to some land formations found on Earth. If such formations are found natrually on Earth, could they not also be found naturally on other planets? This land formation on Mars is natrual, as similar land formations are found naturally on Earth and NASA finding proof of alien life would have benefitted them greatly. If these things are true, then the Face on Mars is a land form that occurred naturally, and we, the people of Earth, have yet to find evidence that alien life exsists in our univserse.

In my opinion it has to be the normal land formation, Mars has a lot of rocks and i know there is a lot of stuff in Mars that look like things in our planet. I do believe that it looks like a human face but Mars has sand storms and gets hit by craters all the time and that may be the reason why there is a face on mars.

As we can see in the pictures in 1976, the face looks better then the other pictures. In 2001, the face is gone because of the snadstorm that they had and covered the face. They have no proof that aliens had something to deal withit. They had no foot prints , no sign of an alien, and It looks like to me that t was created by it self. NASA's has no right to say that the face was created by aliens if they have no sign or proof that it was. They don't have proof that aliens are real.

Now you're proabley thinking mabey NASA is just hiding all evevidence, however wouldn't finding alien life forms help NASA, why would they hide such big news. Buliding and sending things and people into space cost a lot of money, so if NASA finds aliens, that can help pay to discover more of space.So without evevidence that aliens built the Face, it is just natural landform. There are other ways to show that the Face is a natural landform.

Mesa are common landforms

around the American West, as explained in paragraph 12 in the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars'', the Face is actually just a mesa. Since the Face is a mesa and there are mesa on Earth, and no alien lifeforms have been discoverd on Earth, just gives another reason as to why I know aliens did not build it. Natural ladforms occur often in our solor system. Like on Earth we have the Grand Caynon, and Saturn has the rings. This just goes to show that the Face is just anthor landform.

In conclusion, aliens did not make the Face. I know this beacuse there is no evidence that supports thet aliens built it. Also Mesa are common here on Earth. So overall, the Face is just anthor landform in history.",4,1,0.8581901788711548
6c3a92e,"The face on Mars is just a natural formation. It wasn't built by any aliens. Natural formations like the face are commonly seen in that area of Mars. The formation does not completely resemble a face; there are many flaws. NASA would tell the public if they had any solid evidence that suggests it was built by aliens.

Rock formations like the face are common in that area of mars and it is very possible that they could look like a face. There are a lot of rock formations on Mars. Out of all those formations, one of them is probably going to resemble a face.

The rock formation doesn't resemble a face perfectly. There are flaws that suggests it is just a natural formation. If it was an alien built formation, there would be a lot less flaws. They wouldn't waste all that time making it and leave so many flaws.

NASA would definetely tell the public if there was any sign that an alien civilazation built it. NASA would have to tell us that they discovered a civilazation. They get their money from us. NASA would get a lot of funding to explore the face if there was any sign of any civilazation and that is what NASA is all about, exploring.

The face is just a natural formation. No aliens built the face. There are many of these types of rock formations in that area. The formation has a lot of flaws that don't resemble a face. NASA would tell the public if it was built by aliens.",3,1,0.8659594058990479
6c636c4,"Could it be an alian? The Face that appear on Mars is not an alian or a creature its a natural landform. The photos that were taken showed like an Egyptian Pharaoh or a fave called the Face. The scientis at NASA made a research about it.

First on 1976, the Vinking's photo was taken. In that photo it showed that there was a face on Mars. You might think that it was an alian or that their is life on Mars. The photo didn't showed so many details. The camera did't have good quality, you couldn't tell what it really was.

Later on, on 2001 another photo was taken. This time the camera had a better quality. Each pixel was 1.56 meters compare to the old photo that it was 43 meters per pixel. You could see the Face three times bigger. The details where much more clear.

Eventually taking all those photos, the scientist finally came out with an answer. Garvin was saying that,"" If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" All those things he listed were natural landforms on Earth. So as the Face on Mars. The picture shows a Martian like butte or mesa.

After all the research Garvin says, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" By saying that its pretty clear that is was any of what you may be thinking. Before all the research I though it was an alian or a creture too . Now there is nothing to worry about is just a natural landform just like Earth have some too.",3,1,0.803955078125
6c762a7,"Our, planet Earth has created landforms in weird shapes and sizes. Could Mars have been capable to sculpture the ""Face on Mars?"" I definitley think so. The ""Face on Mars,"" was not created by aliens. Here are my reasons why.

My first reason is that the face might just be an illusion. According to the article, the ""Face on Mars,"" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter. This is a cloudy time of year. The sun could be making the unusual shadows giving you the illusion. Also the height of the so called ""nose,"" could be making shadows that form the ""eyes,"" tricking theorist, thinking it looks like a face.

My second reason is that there was no form of life seen near this landform. Building the Face could have taken years and years. NASA would probably have witnessed an alien or aliens during the process of construction. No tools or artifacts were left behind. As said in the passage, "" No alien monument at all.""

My last and final reason is that the Face is just another martian equivalent of a bette or mesa. They are very common around the America West. This could have been the case for Mars.

Jim Garvin from the passage says that the Face reminds him of Middle Butte that is the same height as the face.

You might think there is no way Mars could have created the face so percise and accurately. Its is possible that a meterorite could have hit Mar's surface and coincidentally made it look like a face. Earth does have landforms that are odd as well which can go the same for Mars.

Those were my reaons why the Face is just another natural landform. As you can see that ""Face on Mars,""

was not built by aliens. Conspiracy theorist are in a misunderstanding. Aliens may not have been capable to create a human face. Just rethink all the real life facts and dont jump to any conclusions.  ",3,1,0.9079493284225464
6c96e47,"This ""face"" is just a natural landform. These things happen a lot, you can get a lot of diffrent shapes and sizes from natural landform this one on mars just happens to look like a really realistic face. Plus the ""face"" has changed alot from 1976 to 2001 and we saw the face change with no alien near by changing it and not cause of the camera but because this natural landform is getting older and soon you won't ever be able to tell it was there. There will be other natural landforms and might look like a face. The spacecraft circling the planet would've caught an alien near by . Also it looked alot more like a face in 1976 because the landform is changing and moving so the ""face"" moves and changes with it. Then the team went out there to snap photos and all they got was a sharper view of the ""face"", and no one near by except them. There could be a lot of landform shapes, one could look like a animal or something. These landforms can look like a lot of things and be natural landform and can be creating without aliens. So far we haven't had any proof of aliens ethier. I believe if aliens were real we would find some by now cause we have spacecrafts around certain planets and we've been to the moon and still nothing. Maybe in the future we could find aliens but not now and it's been a while since the ""face"" has been created and we have no proof of aliens and we didn't back then ethier.",2,1,0.8745372295379639

But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

There is no face on Mars it is just a bunch of rocks and shadows making the face. In fact it's just a mesa on mars with shadows common enough. It even said in the text ""Michal Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

6ca477c,"""The Face on Mars"". Many pepole think that its more than what it is. They think that we're hiding something. That maybe what we found was something that we didn't want you to know. However, I can assure you that if their was anything going on in the solar system, that we would tell you because, well thats our job. Our job is to analyze the solar system and keep the public informed on anything that is happening outside of earth that normal citizens couldn't see for themselves. If their was life or anything else on the moon of Mars we would have seen it by now. Also, we would benefit from their being something special about the moon of Mars. Another thing believe it or not we wouldn't keep something that could change the way that we live to ourselves.

We would have seen something extrodinary by now. The picture that was taken in April of 2001 would have shown you anything else that sat nearby ""The Face"". Also in an earlier picture they determined that the mouth, nose, and eyes on ""The Face"" were shadows. They were not built into a structure the way that they would have been if indeed the structure was built by other forms of life. This also just popped up, if say someone or somethign did build it then it would have progressed. It wouldn't have just came to in one of our pictures. However, if say an asteroid had hit the planet, then it could have caused the same thing that had happened here.

On another note, anyone that knows anything about NASA knows that we get funding from the government. When we get funded from the government obviously they need people to check things out. The people that check things out are obviously going to get paid because that is their job. So if we're going to get paid more and more money to try to find life on the moon of mars then why wouldn't we want their to be life on the moon. The funding that NASA gets isn't little. Some people would have the oppertunity to make allot of money. It would also give NASA a chance to get people interested in what they do for a living.

The whole point of our jobs is to go to school to learn how to see things that happen in space beyond what we already know. We want to help and make a difference and keep people informed on what else is out there. So if we found something again we would want you all to know about it because we could teach you something. So many people think that our job is stupid and useless because all we do is stare at the stars. This would be a good way to show everyone that what we do is real. We really do see things that the rest of the world didn't know about. Most kids don't want to be an astronomer anymore they want to be doctors or lawyers. So showing them that what we do is important would be a good thing for the kids. We alll want whats good for the kids so why wouldn't we tell them?

Life on the moon of Mars. It sounds plausable. It sounds amazing. So many good things could come from the fact that there is life on mars that it is unreal.

6cb0aab,"A Face To Remember

A distinctly human face, nearly two miles in length, stretches across an arid, barren landscape. This came to be known as ""the face on Mars. It is a highly debated topic, being that some believe it was made by intelligent lifeforms, and others believe it to be a naturally formed landform. The latter is, beyond the shadow of a doubt, correct, the reasons range from picture evidence, to the same landforms forming on Earth, to the fact that it would help NASA's budget immensely if life were to be discovered on other planets.

To begin with, concrete photos have been released to the public that clearly show that the ""face"" is merely shadows cast onto a natural landform. Since the beginning of its discovery in 1976, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Guess what? They were right, because in 2001, Mars Global Surveyor brought back a photo of the mesa that was in the ""...absolute maximum resolution,"" and it perfectly showed the mesa for what it was; a naturally formed chunk of land.

Another thing distinct about this landform is that we have similair, proven-to-be natural landforms on Earth. To quote Garvin, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This means it is an undeniable truth that these kind of things can form naturally. Of course because something can, usually means that it will, so, without denial, this landform is proven to be real, and able to form.

The final fact of the matter is that NASA would get an enormous amount of funding if they could prove there to be life among the stars. So the truth is, ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This discovery would lead to a piqued interest in space, and a need to conduct further research, meaning people would begin to give more donations to this new, interesting cause. In the end NASA would benefit, and the point is proven wrong.

Over all, consiracy theorist seemingly wish to stir the masses, and make distrust flourish, but most times their theories are easily dissproven. The theory of the face on Mars was simple, and very wrong. The topic of solid photographs seems not to be enough, but the similair landmarks being on Earth, and the way it would positively effect NASA's budget should be. After all, there may still be life on Mars, for this is but a bump on a planet.",5,1,0.8904231786727905
6cf31b1,"In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.

Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?

The face on Mars really hit it off on Earth. Everyone was talking about it. "" The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery story chechout lines for 25 years!"" Some people believe that this face was created by aliens; it is a sign of life on Mars. But, ""few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" That is just crazy, but scientists are backing it up. There is no proof for it to be alien made.

Certain people still say that ""it's aliens, aliens are making these faces!"" That is not true without the evidence. Which, there is none. There are ablolutly zero facts that aliens would be able to make a face. Or that there are aliens. No facts. No aliens. If there were aliens how would they even make a face?

This has to be just a natural landform that formed when a massive sandstorm hit. It is just a coincidence. Nothing freaky or wierd, just a face in the sand. It's natural, not an alien. According to the text, ""What the picture actually shwos is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" See, nothing wierd going on on Mars. Or at least that we know of.

So, in conclusion, this artifact of mars is real. This is, because, there are no facts to prove otherwise. If there were facts than it would be ruled an alien artifact. Which would be pretty cool, but it isn't real. And we shouldn't be pretending like it is real. Scientists are backing this up here they are saying that it can't be an alien artifact. It's impossible as of right now. There is no evidence that an alien has made this face in the sand. ",4,1,0.8707753419876099
6d2adc4,"Have you seen the ""Face on Mars""? If so, do you believe it is natural or created by alien activity? Many people believe the face is evidence of alien life however this is probably not the case. The Mars Global Surveyor ,a mapping spacecraft, has passed over the area few times. However the few times it has passed over there has been no evidence of any form of alien civilization. This led us to believe it is just a natural landform.

This all began when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars. Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible landing sites for his sibling Viking 2. In the midst of doing so Viking 1 spotted what looked like a human face. This was extraordinary because it was on planet Mars! When the images were leaked it led the public to believe that this is evidence of life outside of Earth's atmosphere.

This might not be the case however. NASA believes that the face is just a natural landform similiar to a butte or mesa on that of Earth. There was a lot more evidence pointing towards the side of NASA but that didn't put peoples hopes down. Some of the public hoped and believed this was in some shape or form, evidence of extraterrestriel life.

The pictures of the ""Face on Mars"" that NASA had were actually kind of foggy. They were foggy because the Mars Global Surveyor had to get the photos through clouds. This then led people to believe that NASA was hiding something in the fog. They thought they were hiding the evidence of life. NASA, however wanted to show them this was not the case.

NASA then ,a few years later, passed over the face on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, and rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. NASA eventually captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. This photo cleared up a lot of confusion.

As NASA studied the photograph, they came to realize that the Face was in fact caused by natural means. They then leaked the image to the public and cleared up confusion there too. However, there will always be that group of nay sayers. This group still wanted to believe that the ""Face on Mars"" was evidence of alien life. They still might believe that to this day.

The ""Face on Mars"" has caused a lot of confusion and mystery in the world. Many believed it was natural from the beginning and others not so much. Some have even grown to believe it was natural other than caused by aliens. Of course there are people still on both sides and as of right now we will never completely know the truth. We will know the truth when we go to Mars. Until then everyone will hold their peace and glorify at the mysterious ""Face on Mars"".",4,1,0.9065057039260864

The face on mars is just a illusion of shadows.It makes you see eyes the nose and even a mouth.It looks like a Egyptain Pharaoh but its really just a trick on the eyes.For example when your in a dark room and you see shapes on the wall or your looking at clouds in the sky and you see faces.Its all just an illusion.

We have seen thing like this before too but on earth.Mesa is a common landform in west American.The one on Mars is common to the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho.Its the same height as the one on Mars.There both just natural landforms.

When the face on Mars got its picture taken there was no alien monument just a natural landform.Then when she got in taken again it was a lot better and they made the pictures bigger.If there was anything other then rocks and shawdows we would have seen it.

6d696a5,"The disputes about the Face being an alien creation rather than a landform are preposterous. Alien life is a common conspirasy theory, but this one proves just that: a theory. The Face cannot possibly be an alien creation because there is no evidence of alien life ever existing, the landform it is compared to on Earth was certainly not created by aliens, and scientists have extensively studied it to prove that it is, indeed, a natural landform.

For starters, in order for the aliens to create this two-mile long ""face"", dimensioned straight from NASA, they must first exist. Unfortunately for the pro-alien believers, this has never been proven. Some say that NASA is keeping this monumental secret from us, but, as thoughtfully pointed out in the article, the existance of ancient alien life would benefit them immensely. In this case, there is no reason for them to hide anything.

Another thing worth mentioning is the strong resemblance to the landforms found right here in the United States. These mesas are common in the American West, says chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. There is no reason that they can't be common on the Red Planet, either. The article states that in Cydonia, the region where the Face is located is actually known to have mesas scattered frequently around the area. Unless Earth's mesas, too, were crafted by aliens, they both must be natural landforms.

The Face has been a topic of conversation since it was first photographed in 1976. When NASA first released the picture to the public, the caption stated: ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Then, after extensive research to prove that it was actually not an alien creation of sorts, NASA determined that the shadows were, indeed, the cause of the shapes of the Face. It was even photographed numerous times to prove this fact, and because they felt it was important to taxpayers, as the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program noted.

Skeptics of the Face might say that it is all a well thought out trick to hide alien life ffrom the general public. However, as previously mentioned, NASA would benefit if this ancient civilization was real. Therefore, there is no logical reason they would keep this from us. The article states that when the very first picture of the Face was released: ""the authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This shows us that they are wanting people to be interested, which would be much easier if there was an alien or two to report, but there is clearly not.

The landform labeled the Face is certainly an intriguing discovery, but not for the fact it was an acient alien monument. It is interesting because it connects us with the Red Planet considering we have landforms similar to it, and also the expert study that has gone into it to prove the suspicions incorrect.

The first reason is, that we here at NASA caught an image of a face in 1976 by viking 1. At first we thought it was an alien or a face made by aliens. Then in 2001 we found the same picture of the face, but got a better veiw and a better picture quialty of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the first one. Whe the imaged appeared on JPL web site, reavealing that is was a natural landform, not a face made by aliens.

We did some more tests to be sure that the landform was really a landform or if it was a face made by aliens. We figured out that is was a natural landform.

That is was not an alien monument after all. We tried to find it again but it was hard.

There are no such thing as an alien. This was the reason why there no such things as aliens. We will be doing even more research, thank you.                      ",2,1,0.8092678785324097
6d869af,"The believe of the ""Face on Mars"" being created by aliens is unlogical. The ""face"" is a simple landform. Why would NASA not tell the people there is aliens? There are images to prove that it's nothing but a natural landform.

First, NASA would make tons of money if there was aliens. The ""Face on Mars"" has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and even radio talk shows. They would make tons of money to be the first space station to find logical information to show that aliens exist; they would go down in history. However, NASA is an informative group; they can't send out false information. That is why they aren't releaseing any information; there is nothing to release.

Second, on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time the MOC team took pictures, pictures that were ten times better than the original. When the team uploaded it online the image revealed nothing but a normal, natural landform. That day was cloudy however so any type of alien finding could have been hidden in the haze.

However people still weren't satisfied, so another image was taken on April 8, 2001, on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Which showed nothing again; Garvin stated, ""...you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,"" and, ""So, if there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were!"". Which means that they enlarged the picture and there was nothing there.

In conclusion, one should not believe there is any alien activity to do with the ""Face on Mars"". NASA would get money off having found the first aliens, yet they aren't revealing anything, because there is nothing to reveal. There have been two pictures to prove there is no alien findings on the ""Face on Mars"". The ""Face on Mars"" isn't some alien creation; it's a simple natural landform. ",4,1,0.8588222861289978
6d97a0c,"The Landform that Looks like a Face

On Earth, there are many landforms that might look like a person or a thing. On Mars, there is a landform that looks like a face. This Face has had several photos of it taken by Viking 1 in 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) in 1998, and another (MGS) in 2001. The Face looks like a face because of its characteristics. Although it looks like an enourmous head, it is really just a mesa or butte, a landform, that happens to look like a face.

One reason that this landform is not a face is because NASA revealed a close up picture of the face, revealing only a landform. That picture had a caption that stated, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Before, there were pictures that weren't as high resolution, so it looked like a face but is now proven to be just a landform. This shows that the landform that looks like a face, is just a landform since there is a photo that shows what the ""face"" actually is. This means the face is just a mesa or butte.

Another reason why this Face is just a natural landform, is because this landform is in Cydonia where mesas are common. The text states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharoah."" This shows that mesas in Cydonia are common. Also, the mesa just had unusual shadows that gave it the appearence of a face. This means that this face was just a landform.

Another reason, is that some landforms, like on Earth look like something other than a landform. The text states, ""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.', says Garvin."" This shows that some landforms can represent or look different from what it really is. This would be the Face oon Mars that is a landform. This wouldn't be a face.

Though some people, like cospiracy theorists, may say that NASA wants to hide a type of evidence for life on Mars, they are wrong. The text states,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence for life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say cospiracy theorists."" The text also states, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" NASA responds to conspiracy theorist in this way, because if NASA were to be responsible for discovering life on Mars, they would benefit. This shows that though NASA would like to be responsible fo discovering life on Mars, NASA just wanted to prove that this Face is just a natural landform.

Overall, there are several reasons why this Face is just a natural landform. One of them is that NASA took a picture of the Face, revealing just a landform. Another reason, is that mesas are common in Cydonia, the area where the Face was found. Another reason, is that thhis landfprm like others can look different from what it really is.

6e095cc,"Hello fellow debater! I see you believe that the rock formation on mars may have been created by aliens.As exciting as that would be for us in NASA that is sadley not the case.Here are my reasons why. My three reasons for why the rock formation on mars was not created by aliens are: one the formation has the same structure as a mesa,two the picture evidence,and three if aliens did make it would a be benafical to our belief theirs alien life and b theirs lack of evidence to support this theory.

Reason one! The formation is a natural mesa! Through out the artical we are given hints to the formation being a mesa. In the intro it even says this.Evidence in the text ( paragraph tweleve) suggest that the face on mars is mostley related to the 'butte in the Snke Plain of Idaho says says Garvin'.This means the face on mars is closely related to rock formations found here in on earth.

Reason two! Picture evidence! Picture evidence from the various NASA

spacecraft show us that. As the years went by and our technolagy we were able to get better and better picture resolution and were able to see the picture better. The picture taken by the viking 1( in1976) was a 43 meter per pixel while the picture taken in 2001 had a 1.56 meters per pixel which allows us to take better pictures to see what the rock formation really looked like which is a common day mesa.

Reason three! lack of evidence The lack of evidence about aliens on mars making the rock formation is evident. With little proof that the rock formation was made by aliens makes it hard to say aliens made it. This makes it even harder to prove aliens did this because the same struture of the rock formation can be found on earth in america also given how mars also has about the same size as earth and also having the same gargaphy its possiable that the tectonic plates under the surface of the plant did this. In short we wish it was created by aliens but it most likely wasn't.

This is the end of my statement on why the large rock formation on mars wasn't created by aliens but instead was a mesa a rock formation we can find in modern day america. To recap my reasons on why i dont believe it was created by aliens :one its a mesa, two picture evidence , and three lack of evidence it was made by aliens.",3,1,0.7775017023086548

Some people don't believe the Face on Mars is a natural landform. They believe that aliens created it. Some people also believe that it was not actually found on earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, has compared it to natural landforms on earth. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times better than the original photos taken by the Viking. It took a while, but Jim was able to prove it.

Jim Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" That is a natural landform found on earth. He also says, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" He says this because some people believe that it was not found on Mars.

The passage states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" It was then official that the Face was not created by aliens, it is a natural landform.

Garvin has proven that the Face is a natural landform found on Mars. He gave examples of what natural landforms it could look like on earth. Viking 1 captured amazing photos of the Face. Michael was able to snap a better picture than the Viking photos. People still do not believe that it is a natural landform, but Jim has proven it.                            ",3,1,0.8555931448936462

Here is how we think that it is a natural landform, as it says in the article ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, se if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""and it also says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

Even though we think it is natural landform you guys think that aliens have made it and your point is as it says in the article ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.""

So as it says in the article ""It's not easy to target Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips we just don't pass over the face ver often.""

In conclusion even though the alien thing has a good point the pictures that Viking 1 and 2 got show that there are no alien markings and it is probably just a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho or the Grand Canyon.",3,1,0.8897473812103271
6e2aa67,"Well, I suppose it coud have been made by aliens, but as we continued to research it. It became known to us that something was casting a shadow as we said in our article about the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" said in paragraph 3. NASA

releasing it in the hopes while it was coming to public. To sale in stores and area in business ,and it did. Hoping it to be real so we can lead people into the existence of it being real. But noticing ourself that it wasn't true that it wasn't real.

Sadly for us as believers of life on other planets and creation of art from other living things.

In April 5, 1998 when we snapped some pictures ten times as better than the Viking did we notice that it was just a landform a big rock formation. The location of the Face of Mars is 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April on Mars very cloudy during this time so lots of winds,and dust blow past and covers the rock formation. The picture actually just shows us that is just like a regular formation on Earth as said in paragraph 12 ,and also looking identical to landforms in the American West area.",2,1,0.7961403131484985
6e2d013,"Have you every heard of the ""Face on Mars?"" Some people even think that the face was an alien. NASA (the people who found the ""face"" on Mars) could say otherwise. NASA has many diffrent ways that this is not an alien. The three are that no alien monuments anywhere, that NASA spent countless time trying to make sure that they were wrong, and that the shadows and the lighting make it look like a face.

The first reason why it is not an alien is because they looked for an alien monument and didn't find one. This either means that NASA took all that time and did not find one, or there is not alien monument which means that this being an alien is slim. Not having a monument means that the ""aliens"" didn't have a home or a place to worship. NASA even had a camera ten times sharper than what they found the face with,""MIchael Malin and his MArs Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos""(7). This goes to show that the monument and the aliens do not exist.

The second reason is that they tried countless times trying to find more. They spent many years trying to find answers but they never found them. The only answer they got was that the alien they were hopping for wasn't present or was present. On April 8, 2001, that was thier last try. They had amazing pizels but still got nothing, ""Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution"" (10.)

Finally, the shadows made it look like it was a face. Even though it looked like a face, we never know if a shadow hit it good enough that it made it look like that. NASA states that ""only this one had unusual shadows to make it look like an egyptian Pharaoh,"" (2.) This states that unusual shadowing made the mesa look unusual. The later years, the mesa looks less and less like a face.

This shows that the ""Face on Mars"" looks more and more like a shadow. Many years have been put into this ""Face on Mars."" Yet there is not that much they found. NASA would have got a lot of money if they found it. Yet they turned it down because they knew that it was not an alien like they would have hopped.               ",4,1,0.7987421751022339

If aliens where real they weapons and mind would probaly be more advanced. They would have to have made homes, spacecrafts and probably guns as well. Think about it it has to be a natural land form just look at the our worlds natural land forms. Im sure there are landformes that look like faces or objects somewhere. So it must be a landform that is the only way because aliens would have showed them selves by now it is just that simple.

6ea3842,"We (NASA) have recently discovered the ""face"" on Mars which has been a big thing since we gave the information out to the world.

A lot of people think it's an actual face created by aliens because the time before we discovered it it was foggy up on Mars so they think aliens must have did it then.

Do you think it's a real face created by aliens or just something natural that happened? Since you said yes your wrong and now I'm going to give factoral information to support my answer.

First we did think that it could have been a real face too but that didn't last very long because every happening has to have an explanation.

We figured it was just another Martian mesa but it did turn out to have unusual shadows making it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

But that's all it was just unusual shadows that appeared on the ""face"".

We then later revealed the image for everyone to see and it sure did give a lot of attraction to Mars.

The ""face"" appeared in movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a haunted grocery store check out line for 25 years!

Then everyone thought that that was actual evidence of life on Mars!

NASA kind of did wish that there was ancient civilization on Mars.

It was our priority to take bunch of pictures of this controversy to come up with an explanation for all this for everyone to understand what it really is.

So in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, the (MOC) team shot a picture ten times that was even more clearer than the originals.

Everyone was exited, waiting for the picture to come out on the internet to figure out what it really was.

The picture then finally came out and it turned out to be a natural landform!

Not very exiting, huh?

But still a lot people didn't believe us because in the winter of 1998 it was very cloudy up there and some beleive the aliens were hidden by the fog.

So in April 2001, we went to get a second look and this time we used the best camera we could find that picked out every detail.

Do you think they found alien evidence?

Nope we didn't, it turned out to be a butte or a mesa.

So now you know the real answer.

Even though it does look like a face and is very unusual we found the facts.

But could maybe someday we find weird alien evidence up in space on a planet?

NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites. They were looking for landing sites for Viking 2. When they spotted the a human face.

I say that the face was made by landform. If it wasan't who would of made the face? The land had hills or something so it could make the face. The face has since became a pop icon. Or something made the figures in the area to make the face.

Although a few scientist believed the Face was an akien artifact, photographing cydonia became a priority for NASA. When Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the viking missions ended.

Last but not least when we went back in April 8, 2001 (on a cloudless day) and took a picture it clearly showed that it was not built by alien lifeforms.

When the pictures were took they were all taked in different time periods. In each picture they were different. In the first picture the face is clearly shown but we didnt get a clear enough picture, so we went back a second time to see take another one. In the second picture it is slightly hard to determened if the face is there or not. So of course we still werent satisfied, and yet again on April 8, 2001 we sent ANOTHER ship so take ANOTHER picture, i need to remind you this is on a cloudless day, and when the (multiple) pictures were taken, it was just some old hill with nothing special to it.

A few days after recieving the picture NASA made it public! If we had truly thought that this was a ""Acient Artifact"" we would have kept it secret and not relised it publicly until after we (knew) that it was created by aliens. Which shows that we always knew it wasnt a alien artifact after all.

I can see why most people had thought it was a acient alien artifact though. I mean most people dedicate their life finding out if there is more lifeforms out there. So most people had to have hope. For the sake of what they chose to do with there life.

In April 8, 2001 NASA went back to snap ANOTHER photo. This day (to remind you) was a cloudless day. So we knew it would be the perfect day to snap the finishing photo. The photo that would settle everything. Not long after the photo was snapped NASA recieved it, and for some it was satisfying to find out that it wasn't a acient alien artifact. Others (on th other hand) were devistated (for the same reason in paragraph 3). The debate was over it, was and is official that it wasn't a acient alien artifact.

Some people claim to see bigfoot but we have no proven fact that he is real. For all we know, bigfoot could be a man dressed in a costume when people claim to see him.

way to far. The people started to make movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! The ""Face on Mars"" has certainly made people believe that there are actual aliens, but then again where is the evidence?

I mean it would not hurt NASA any if there was evidence of aliens, it would only make them gain not lose anything. There are landforms similar to the face that form in Idaho. The landforms are very common around the American west. The NASA ship even had a better camera and it still did not catch any life on Mars.

My evidence that the face is not really a human being is first of all it doesnt even have a body. Since they took pictures of the face, they could have croped the pictures to look real. In the pictures that scientists took of the face in 1976 to 2001 the pictures look nothing like a face. The pictures show cracks that may appear to look like a face but really isnt.

When a scientist was taking a picture on mars he noticed an enormous head nearly two miles from one end to the other end and it seemed that it was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called cyndonia. The cause of that could have been a shadow and not a human looking back at him. Another thing is that i dont think they seen a Martian because when they said that they had pictures of a Martian, picture cant always be true because of how people crop pictures today.

The first time they saw the face was when it was all shadowy so you could barely see it but as time past by it was 1998 when they went back up to mars with oe of the vikings to take another picture and it was more clear. They had to 12 years to go back up to mars and I dont think that aliens could build it that fast, it would've at least taken more time to make a good face. Then at the year 2001 they took another picture and it was fading away and I honestly dont think that the aliens would be able to take the face down that fast and why would they have to take it down. It has to be natural because there are no suh things as aliens, because no one from nasa has ever seen one and if they would've Nasa would've told everybody that they have found aliens and that they are real. Also I know its natural because even nasa said that the face had a nose,eyes,mouth, and looked exactly like a humans face.

A few days later NASA unveiled images for everyone to see while captioning it ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The landform was just formed by shadow, which means this just gives others the illusion that it's a face, but it is just a natural landform.

Many out there have created movies, books and magazine article on the Face but this is all just bandwagon, trying to just sell their products and make money out of false theories.

6f1773b,"The Face on Mars was created by natural landforms and it is impossible to have been created by aliens. First,there was no sign of alien interaction on Mars when the Face appeared. Next,it has been proven that the picture of the Face was actually a butte or mesa landform. Also, the other picture that was taken was more visual and it was 3 times bigger than the original. The Face couldn't have been formed by alien life.

One reason that proves that the Face is natural is that there has never been any alien interaction evidence on any planet. First of all,it is not possible for aliens to create a face in cement rock. Next,aliens wouldn't know what a face would look like because they wouldn't have a mirror and they wouldn't even know what they look like. Finally,if aliens were able to move rock,they wouldn't have any tools to use. Aliens couldn't have formed the Face if we don't even know if they exist.

Another reason that the Face is natural is that it has been proven that the Face was created by a butte or mesa landform. First,these landforms are very common in the American West. Next,Garvin knows that they are common because he mentioned,""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""Garvin also said that the Middle Butte landform is the same height as the Face on Mars. If the Face is similar to another landform,it is most likely a natural landform.

The final reason that the Face is natural is that the first picture that was taken,isn't as clear as the newer picture. First,when the original picture was taken,it was very cloudy and difficult to see during the winter in April. This could have been mistaken for alien markings because the sight wasn't easy to see. Finally,the newer picture that was taken had a digital image 3 times bigger than the original pixel in the first photo. The newer photo proves that aliens were not around at all.

In conclusion,many people may have thought the Face was formed by aliens,but they only thought that because of the evidence they were given. The original photo was not clear so the newer photo shows what it really looked like. The Face also had similar features to mesa and butte landforms which are very common in many areas.

6f51437,"The so called ""Face"" on Mars is simply a landform created by nature. There are conspiracy theorists who like to believe that this is not true and NASA has something to hide. They also like to believe that because the images of the ""Face"" are not high quality photographs, that has something to do with hiding the secret of life on Mars. The fact of the matter is that there is no secret and if there was life on Mars, it would benefit NASA to share that knowledge to gain money for their space programs.

To start with, the ""Face"" on Mars is ""...the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa -- landforms common around the American West."" The first sentence in paragraph twelve simply disproves that the ""Face"" on Mars could be anything mire than a face. Looking a little deeper into the text, it becomes clearer how NASA has nothing to hide when it comes to the ""Face"". By looking into paragraph two and paragraph three it becomes clearer that NASA has looked into this odd rock formation clearly and can see that there is nothing to hide from anyone.

Another argument that conspiracy theorists bring to the table is that the original images from the Viking were blurry, making it hard to see anything surrounding this rock formation. These theorists say this believing the images were purposely blurred in order to hide something from the public. The truth is that the Viking took its photo in 1976, the MGS in 1998 and again in 2001. Being that the newest image until 2001 was the one taken in 1998, it is obvious that there couldn't be high quality pictures taken from a spacecraft back then. Also, the image taken in 2001 is way more high definition and you can clearly see that the image depicts a simple rock formation. So, the argument that the blurry image is hiding something must be false.

In conclusion, none of the theories brought up against the pure facts laid out could conquer. The theory tree was easily chopped down but the mighty fact axe, becasue the conspirers could not bring any evidence to support their argument. Also finding how every argument that NASA has nothing to hide, and that the images clearly show nothing but a rock formation is clearly supported by evidence. Facts prove that there is no way the ""Face"" on Mars is anything other than a simple landform.",4,1,0.9016574621200562

But, anyway conspiracy theorists think it could be created by aliens even though there is all of this evidence to prove that wrong. In the article there are many key points to prove the conspiracy theorists' theories are wrong and that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.

To support the idea that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform you can look into the essay. In the article, the text states,"" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" This part of the passage starts the argument because twenty five years ago their spacecraft cameras weren't as good as the ones that were in 2001. So, the picture that came out of the spacecraft was not as clear as it could have been with a 2001 camera and with the shadows forming the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth, people thought it could have been created by alien lifeforms. To disapproved of this idea though, the text states,"" on April 8,2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enought for a second look."" Also the text says,"" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56meter compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added 'So, if there were objects in this picture like airplsnes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This evidence form the ending of the paragraph ten to the end of paragraph eleven shows how much of better quality the picture would be in when taken. The final supporting detail in the passage to prove the Face on Mars is not created by is the text states,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or messa-landforms common around the American West"" This clearly states that its just a landform called a butte or mesa that is commonly found around the American West. This evidence clearly disapproves of the ""Face on Mars"" is not created by aliens because we have these on Earth as well.

6f8353a,"Have you ever wondered about the Face? The one so talked about, movies and books were made about it? In the late 90's, there was a picture taken of a rather human like landform. But get this

-

it wasn't on Earth! The discussion of whether the landform was alien made or a common Cydonia Martian mesa was huge, and is still fret over today. But lets get real, the possibility of the landform being alien made is surreal - with our advanced technology today, we would know!

About twenty-five years ago, an interesting picture was found with one of NASA's spacecrafts, Viking 1. From the region Cydonia of the 'Red Planet', Viking 1 had taken a picture of a large face that stretched almost two miles wide. The landform became better known as the Face. When the picture was released to public, it was a big deal. Scientists had begun to figure it was just another Martian mesa that just happened to have unusual shadows. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", paragraph two even states this. These shadows caused many people to assume it looked similiar to some kind of Egyptian Pharaoh. The general public, although amazed by the coincedence it had been, couldn't have ignored the sayings of a scientist, especially when all the facts come into play with the logical explanation - not aliens!

Even with the scienctists saying what was undeniably the truth, people demanded proof. Few scientists believed the chance of the Face being put there by exterestrial beings, but getting images became one of NASA's priorities. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take ten times sharper images of the Face. In the paragraph seven, you could find that thousands of people were waiting, waiting for an image that may decide what exactly the Face had been. After the image had been taking, not everybody was happy. This resulted in many suggestions as to why there was no proof of aliens having made the Face. It was winter and hazy. Reading through paragraph eight of the article, you can also find many of the excuses used to try and find proof of aliens exsistence.

With many complaints under their belts, Mars Global Surveyor went for another go. This time on a cloudless summer day. On Apri 8, 2001, they were sent in for another look at the Face. The images, taken again, did not show any proof of aliens. To many conspiracy lovers dismay, the images were rather like Earth Landforms. Instead of alien markings, they found that the Face is equivalent to butte or mesa. Even common to landforms in the American West. In paragraphs ten, eleven, and twelve, you can read through the precautions taken to find even clearer images of the Face, though nothing had changed. Without any other evidence to go off of, what could the theorists say?

Others, such as conspiracy theorists, say that NASA has found evidence of the other life forms. They may be right, stating things such as this. But they also say that NASA is withholding this information. While that may be a good idea for other people, NASA's budget says otherwise. With the information of alien exsistence out, their funds could go up a rather lot. Would it be a good idea to hold this information to the public? Especially when it will not only be informing the people, but also helping NASA discover more about our universe.

As stated the possibility of us not coming across alien lifeforms with todays technology is unlikely. With all the precautions they took to prove (or in this cause, disprove) alien exsistence, it is highly unprobable that we missed them. With the scientist, looking over the images twice, and then checking them, the answer is in lockdown. And even if we were, sharing the information is in almost everyone's best interest.

I've been researching the Faces on Mars, I have so much research and I've been working on this for awhile now. So right now I'm going to be talking about me trying to convince someone that the Faces on Mars is just a landform.

Today, I'm meeting with a guy who wants to know more about these face/landforms on Mars, so today I'm going to sit with the guy and talk with him. Well the guy comes in and he's wanting to know all these things about the faces on Mars, and then I interuppted him and said, ""did you know those are landforms"" and he replaid, ""no those are faces."" So then i was like can you give me any information explain why you think those are faces and he said because I've say people saying that on the interent.

I said, ""Well that's what people are saying on the internet, so it might not always be true. So here is some information that I've researched about the landforms on Mars that might make you think diffrently. There has been pictures taken of the landforms from 1976,1998 and 2001, and yes they kind of look like faces but they are landforms. NASA defends what people are saying about the faces on Mars. Yes, peple think that there is life on Mars,but how would the faces on Mars prove that? The guy then says yeah I understand were your coming from. The guy then says yes, I guess your right about them being landform. It really didn't take much convincing. Before the guy left he said Thanks. After doing all that I went ahead and did more research just so if I found more about the landforms, then I could call the guy and let him know what's going on.            ",2,1,0.741082489490509

First, how could there ever be life on another planet? Mars does not even have enough water for human life. In the passege ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", it states, ""The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" The reson why the rock formation looks like a face could be from rocks being inside the sand to formate the face and the rocks could have shrunken or have gone away.

Now, this face is a land form, it just looks like a face. This can happen anywhere in the world, not just on Mars. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars it says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural land form. There was no alien monument after all."" This proves that the picture that was taken may looked like a face but was in fact, a landform, and thd cause of this face can be from anything out in the environment.

In conculsion, the ""Face of Mars"" is not a face, its alnd form, no faces can still be dented in a land form for that long. The cause of making this face can be from rocks, or any other thing on Mars. ",2,1,0.8980193138122559

They think it was made by aliens, and was it aliens or just landforms.

There was a face on mars. NASA's took some photos of the face. A lot of people seem to think that it is aliens that made look like face. People knew there most be others living on mars.

Poeple think it made by made by aliens. Other knew that it was made by the first humens and to think it look like Egyptian Phareoh. Why was it there and want to know who put there and how did it get there. So did people think is was aliens or humens.

Was it aliens or just landforms. To find out that it was just landforms some people want it aliens or first humens. Some what knew what is look like them was (middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho). Other knew that was landforms.

6fbb921,"I do not agree that the face on Mars was made by aliens for a couple of reasons. The reason one because nobody has found life on Mars Only samples that they can never find to be true. Another reason for my disagreement is because even if there were some aliens that made that face the government wouldn't leak that information to the public because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. I also disagree because in paragragh seven when they flew over Cydonia for the first time on April 5,1998 they said that there was no alien monument after all. From my understanding what the last paragrah is saying is it is just a landform not created by aliens just made by land such as dirt,dust,mud or whatever is on that planet. Also in the three pictures that look like they are changing every year they took the pictures so maybe Mars has storms which causes the dirt or dust to shift or move around I mean u wouldn't say the aliens know what time the scientist take the pictures so the change the look of the face that would be outragoues. The last reason for me thinking that the face is a landform and it was not created by aliens is because it clearly states in the reading that they found out it was just a ""messa brutte"" which is a landform so that gives the answer right there. This is why I degree with whoever says that aliens formed the face on Mars.",3,1,0.8759259581565857
6fe2b9f,"Unmasking the Face on Mars has always been an argumentive topic for us scientists and the conspiracy theorists. Is it just a naturally forming landform? Was it created by aliens? No one knows for sure but from our research, it is very unlikely that aliens could have assembled it.

Us scientists here at NASA take our jobs very seriously. We research the outside world for a living and theorists are just taking guesses! Would you rather believe a NASA scientist or a conspiracy theorist's hypothesis of space? As humans, we always choose the craziest scenarios and we assume the worst. It could be something as simple as a landform for all we know.

There is no proof of aliens but there is proof of landforms forming naturally. Yes, the ""face"" looks like it was made to look that way and yes it is oddly accurate to the face of an egyptian pharoh but this could just be a coincidence. We have very high tech cameras that shoot pictures of mars all the time. The ""best"" picture of the face from 1796 was taken by a camera with 43 meters per pixel. In 2001, we used a camera with 1.56 meters in each pixel so if there were so called ""aliens"" that assembled the face, they would have been captured in the shot as well. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. People sometimes say it reminds them most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Another thing that makes the idea of it being a landform likely is that Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa which is about the same height as the Face on Mars so they are both very similar to eachother.

There are a lot of ideas about what the Face could be. We will continue research and further our studies. Until then, believe as you wish but remember, scientists or theorists?       ",4,1,0.8985186815261841
70207b5,"Ever since humans have discovered space and the existence of other planets, the belief that we are not alone in the universe has been a back-and-forth question over the years. It has inspired many works and become a huge part of pop culture. While this can be fun to think about, sometimes people who can't accept the truth take it too far. The Face on Mars is just a natural landfrom because technology wasn't that good in 1976, people (especially conspiracy theorists) take can take things like this too far, and the formation is just like others on Mars and even on Earth.

The original photo of the Face on Mars was taken way back in 1976 by NASA's Viking 1. The spacecraft was only trying to find landing spots for another NASA ship, Viking 2, when the picture was snapped. Technology has evolved vastly over the past few decades, but 1976 was right at the start of this kind of space exploration technology, with the moon landing only happening 7 years prior to this event. When the latest photo of the face was snapped in 2001, its resolution was 10 times sharper than the Viking 1's photo. It showed every crack and bump on the surface of the ""face"", while the Viking's only showed patches of white while most of it was covered in shadow. Even a Mars Global surveyor photo from 1998 (which was taken with better technology than the Viking 1's) revealed a mesa formation. The photos taken after the original in 1976 definitely show anything but a face, which shows that the Face on Mars was only seen because of developing technology at the time.

Everytime there is a statement made by an organized group like NASA, or a government of any kind, people like to try to disprove these statements and say that they are fake. These people are called conspiracy theorists. They usually jump to conclusions on statements like this all the time with little or no evdidence. Back in the 1960s and '70s, the space race had started, causing many people to believe that we are not alone in this universe of ours. Anytime there was a trace of alien life out there, radios would broadcast about it, new channels would cover it, and sometimes even movies were made about these, just like in the case of the Face on Mars. Since these are people's main sources for news, they believed the claims instantly. When NASA revealed a picture of a supposed 'face on mars', the population went crazy. This was solid proof of ancient alien life on another planet, the conspiratists believed, but alas, the only reason this face appeared was due to technology with not enough resolution to snap a high quality picture of the formation. Conspiratists claimed that alien life on Mars would be something that NASA would ""want to hide"", but in response to this, defenders of the NASA budget said that ""they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars"". If the face was actually alien, NASA never would have come out and told the public of its existence, or at least would've said that it was alien in its reveal. Instead that caption read; ""A huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head..."" This shows that NASA directly knew that the formation was natural and most definitely not alien.

The Face on Mars was quite the phenomenon, which started out the belief that there was alien life out in space and also on the planets near to Earth. When scientists first saw the formation from the Viking 1, they were suprised to see a face on the screen, but that was only at first. Scientists quickly realized that the face was nothing more than a Martian Mesa. These mesas are very common around Cydonia (the region of Mars in which the photo was taken). These formations are also on other parts of Mars and even here on Earth. Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River of Idaho."" This shows that a formation like a mesa is super easy to indentify, and one on Mars could just as easily be identified with good enough technology, as proven by the Mars Global Survey spacecraft and the Mars global surveyor from 1998, which was even taken through clouds on the red planet. It makes sense for the formation to be a mesa, especially since the fact that there were no other facelike structures like this found on Mars since.

The Face on Mars is a natural landform because the technolgy that took the photo wasn't that great compared to years after, conspiracy theorists can really blow things like this in the worng direction, and the formation of the face resembles structures like that on Mars and Earth. With our knowledge and exploration of space growing every day, it is just a matter of time until we discover alien life somewhere. The problem is, people can get so caught up in these kind of things and overexagerate them to beyond reasoning. Technology has advanced so much in the past few years, so much that we can see every crack and divit on the surface of a planet, so the question is, when will we actually discover a real ""Face on Mars""?",6,1,0.862305760383606

The ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon and was present in many films, books, and even radio stations.

The lack of evidence of life on Mars led people to also believe that NASA was withholding information regarding aliens or other life forms. These theories can not hold true because NASA would benifit greatly on finding life on Mars. NASA's profits would begin to increase.

Pictures were later taken to confirm that there is no alien monument on Mars. The picture actually showed a Martian equivalent of a butte or mess, landforms which are common on Earth.

NASA had released the picture to the public. They had made hollywood movies and book and had went on talk show talkiong about the face saying are there really aliens out there .

It was even compared to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.

In paragraph 3, it stated "" huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" When NASA showed it to the public they hoped it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars and it certainly did.

In paragraph 3 it states that, "" . . . formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.""

The mesa is about 2 miles long, and the face is created by the shadows from protruding rock. The features of this landform could have been created by aliens if they had the ability to carve a two mile long mesa to look like a face, not knowing what it looked like while they were carving it. Since they were on the ground they we we carving, they would have had to either cut into the rock blindly, or have a method to see what the face looked like. That method, be it mechanical or optical should still be visible. The aliens might not be humanoid, and might not know what a human face looked like. They wouldn't be able to cut out an image of something if they don't know what it looks like. Even if aliens could cut a face into the rock, there would be fragments of that rock lying all around the base of the landform. Most of the debris might be swept away over time, but there would still be some. If the carving was done by aliens, they would have to have some way to get on top of the mesa, and that might be visible. It could be stairs, or a ladder, or a rope, but it should be visible to the satellite pictures. If the aliens did cut the face into the mesa, then it they would have gone about it in a different way. Assuming that the aliens created the face is assuming that they are intelligent beings. Intelligent beings would most likely have created finer details or carved a symbol or word to show who created the face.

First, the people who say that there is really a civilization, were probably sitting in the sun to long. They also may not believe in the Bible. It says that God came once to die for all mankind. If that's not true than wouldn't he have to go to every single planet to die for those people too? It really just doesn't add up! Second, the people that say that it is really only a natural landform are probably more acurate. While the Face does on fact look like someone built it doesn't mean that there are people living there. The Bible does mention aliens, but not of that sort. It refers to them as people who have denied God and gone their own ways. Third, the article states that the Face has ""become a pop icon"". How can this really be true?

717fb16,"In this article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". Many people believe that this imprint of a human beings' face was sculpted by aliens. In this essay, I will provide many reasons why this imprint was just a natural landform that looked identical to a human face.

Scientist have discovered that this ""Face"" on Mars was just a natural landform. Many people are trying to say that the face was created by aliens. There are many ways that we could prove that aliens DID NOT create this fasinating landform. From far away, this imprint looks exactly like a human face. If you focuse hard enough on this sculpture, you could indentify its eyes, mouth, nose and head shape.

One of the many reasons that this artifact was not created by aliens is because, provided in the article, back on April 5th, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Scientist studied the artifact from afar, yet, they were still able to see the face. One of the scientist, Michael Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took pictures of this marvelous sculpture. As Michael looked closer into each picture, he discovered that the creation was not carved that way in any sort. He discovered that the artifact was just a landform that began to age that way.

Another way to prove this artifact was not created by aliens is, there was no one there at the planet Mars. Scientist looked all over the planet, circled it for a long period of time. There was no foot prints, or any marks on this planet. Many believed that no matter how hard they searched, the solution would come out possitive. No one came and created this impressive land.

In the passage it says on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Each pixel spanned about 1.56 meters in 2001. The best Viking photo in 1976 was measured out to be 43 meters per pixel. This is when they knew for a fact that this landform was not something anyone else was able to make. This was all just a huge coincedense that there was a face imprinited on our called, ""Red Planet"".

This is why we should believe that ""the Face"" was just a natural landform. All facts has proven, that this creation was just part of Mars. There was no clear explaination that an alien would come and create this. If aliens tend to exist, there's no possible way they would know the facial structures of a human face.

This information is unaccurate.

The face on Mars was not created by aliens, it is actually a natural landform.

The Face of Mars is a natural landform which can be proven by research conducted by NASA.

NASA claims that the face seen by the Viking 1 photo in 1976 is mearly a natural landform.

This can be proven by information found on April 8, 2001 when Garvin's team captured an image at 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in 1976.

With this amount of precision, other things created by aliens would have been able to have been witnessed as well.

NASA is also the most trusted and deserving space agency because of past information that is trusted by most of the world.

NASA has also released a statement saying that the Martian butte or mesa are landforms common around the American West.

Garvin says,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

In this article, there is evidence that proves that the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

This information can be shown in paragraph 3 where it says,"" huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

This information shows that NASA knows that this was made by shadows and not aliens.

Also, in paragraph 11 where it states,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,"" he added.

"" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

This statement proves that since there was no other evidence pointing toward the fact of aliens creating this Face, there is only one explanation which is that the Face is a natural landform just as we have here on Earth.

Furtermore, in paragraph 12, the author mentions that the the picture,"" is the Martian equvalent of a butte or mesa.""

Humans have buttes and mesa down on Earth which are natural landforms.

This proves that the landforms there could have been created the same way on Mars as they were on Earth.

The planet mars is supposed to be a very rusty dusty planet and is very cold at night and decently warm in day. If this was created by aliens we would need proof or sightings of the aliens that have created this for it to be considered true.

This myterious landform may have been created by heavy winds of dust to form and odd face on the side of top of some hill or mountain on mars. It could just be shadows from other big landmarks nearby this one that has cast its shadow over this one that could resemble a face. Or if there is alien life on mars then there might be just a small possibility of this have been created by aliens just to get our attention to visit there planet and if that is the case then we shall have to explore it to see and come to a conclusion of how the mysteirous landform was created to begin with than we might agree to that aliens created it.

I think that this landform on mars was just created by heavy winds and shadows from other bigger mountains nearby this one and happend to cast it shadow over this one to resemble a face on this one that is what it think. In this article we talked about how oddly shaped the landform was we talked about why people think it is made by aliens on planet mars and how the landform was possibly created .",4,1,0.8370275497436523

Not evryone was satisfied with what they heard so there was more research on the Face of Mars skeptics said that there were alien markings left hiddin by haze. The controllers were curious so they decided to look over it again just to be sure, it wasn't easy to target it the Cydonia it was very hard to actually do it the Surveyor was a mapping of the spacecraft and it usually looked straight down and it scaned the plant.

After they scaned on April 8th the Malins team saw an unexpected photo, they had to look very close enough they rolled they're spacecraft 25 degress to the center and each of the pixels were 1.56 meters, and was just like the 43 meters.

It came to the end is that it was landforms that were most likely common in the American West and the "" Face on Mars"" actuaclly showed butte or mesa. If there were was any kind of objects in the picture such as air planes that were on the ground or Egyptian pyrmids you would be able to actuaclly see them and what they were.

Scientists at Nasa say it is a natural landform. Although few scientists belive it is an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for Nasa.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origial photos. The pictures revealed it was just a natural landform. Not everyone was satisfied.

On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor took a second look. This image was taken using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. If there were any objects in the picture, you would see what they were.

Landforms like this are common around the American West. What the pictures actually show are the Martian equivalence of a butte or mesa. It's really a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

I can see how the mass could be mistaken as an alien form. There is no proff that it is an alien form though and NASA knows what they are talking about and researches it. Therefore it is proven to be a natural landform.",3,1,0.8127772808074951

Maybe but some people does, there might be an alien, but there is no way they are going to created that Face on Mars. If there is an aliens they wouldn't leave trace like that on Mars. We have been seeing this face form 1976 to 2001 still there is no prove. All we know is there is a Face on Mars. We doesn't know who created this face or where is came up form.

As science tells us, and from what professional scientist have researched and studied at NASA, there is no life on Mars. Whether that life form be intellegent and macroscopic (visible to the naked eye) or bactireal and microscopic (only seen with a microscope). It is obvious to tell that the Face is merely an act of nature. For example, God's Thumb, a rock formation in the desert of New Mexico. The rock formation looks the way it does from centuries of erosion from wind, water, and sand. It is likely the Face has expirienced the a congruent form of events. It is also likely that the Face is a work of volcanic activity. Mars has a rich history of volcanic activiy. Mars just happens to be the home of the largest volcano in the entire solar system. From that information, it would be of no surprise to find the Face to explode in a giant fury of smoke, ash, and lava. Although, it would be an extraordinary happening to see. Going back to the previous point made erosion, apon closer inspection, you can clearly see trenches across the Face. These may very well be from liquid water flowing on the surface, wcich recent discoveries confirms. Also, around the foot of the Face, is a large gathering of rock, dust, and other debris from probabal erosion, evidence for such thing can most likely be found right in your own back yard. Say there is a small pile of dirt or a sand box your children plays in and builds a ""mountain"" as they would call it. Then after your children come inside, it rains. when the rain stops, you go out and check to see if the area is safe to play in for your children. As you inspect the area of play, you notice small trenches and wash-out around the base of the pile of sand. With all things considered, this scientific reasoning should sway your thoughts of little green men with space ships and laser blasters.",3,1,0.8315391540527344
7228e60,"When people hear the title ""Unmasking the face on Mars"" they think look their is a face or structure on mars that the aliens built. But what it's really soposed to be is or equivalent to is a butte or mesa. So if you think that for a split second think agian cause your wrong.

To start of this discusion of the so called ""face"" on mars I would like to tell you is that it is not at all a face. What it is just a landform that has formed to look so simular to a face or moument of the martians. But mars is like earth it forms things just like it so what it really is is just a couple of rocks and thier shadows to form a face like thing.

On the other hand is how do we know this. Well ever since the discovery scientist have been researching and taking more pictures and looking at it a whole lot closer. What we came up with is that like I said before a landform on mars but some say where wrong.

Another reason that bothers me is how people think its a conspiracy theory. many, many, many people think ""oh its just nothing but the martians"" but no this is just a mesa but since people say that stuff we had to prove them wrong. So what NASA did was they built a big camera to take pictures of it to prove it was a big rock which it was a huge budget problem for them but they still did it.

People may argue by saying so if it is something simular to earth then that means martians were here to and then they got bord of the place they so they left and went somewhere else. then they built this big face of maybe a king or emporer or something and they are hiding from us. But there not its just a rock. what I am trying to say is that the ""face"" is just a mesa and nothing else but a mesa so if someone says its a face just say its a mesa. ",3,1,0.8708827495574951

Its just like that it may look like something that you know but yet it has to have all these diffrent things happen to it befor it looks like that. Like a shadow or the right angle and if NASA did find something that they really did thank it was made from aliens they wouldnt just freely relesse it to the public like that they would put millions of dollors in reserch in to find how it was built. ,2,1,0.701249361038208

People many have a strong theory, but it many not always make sence. The Face on Mars is a total natural landformation. NASA's scientist have not found any signs of aliens on the planet Mars. The article states that not many scientists believe that there was an alien artifacts on Mars. Scientists also say that it is hard to track Cydonia and to get a clear image on the face.

The face has to be a natural landformation because most of the wierd landforms on Earth may look like ancient aliens did it but it was not. Scientists have not proved that aliens are real and that all wierdly amazing artifacts are from them. Aliens are not real although there are shows about them being real, but those are all conspiracies. The conspiracies may look real and sound real but they are just trying to get people's attention to hear them out and to convice them that aliens are real.

Scientists say that our minds are tagated to find faces in objects. We see all kinds of shapes in the cloudy skys because our minds are trained to do that. The Face on Mars is just one of the many things that we can find a face in a natural landformation. The article states that the landforms are also common near the American West on Earth. Garvin says ""It reminds me mosr of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, there are big conversations about the Face on Mars. Some many think it is an ancient alien formation, but others say it is a natural landformation. Scientist have a hard time tracking down Cydonia and also taking pictures of the face. Aliens have not been proven to be out in outerspace, so therefore it cannot be an alien formation. This Face on Mars is an natural formation because there are similar landformation on Earth near the American West and also in Idaho. Whether it is an alien formation or a natural one I am saying that the Face on Mars is just another natural fanominon. ",4,1,0.8895940780639648
72d2ec7,"The Face of Mars isn't a face at all! It's just the shadows that gives the eyes, nose and mouth a look. It could be possible for the aliens to create the Face of Mars but it'll take ages for the aliens to perform a task like that. The Face of Mars is only a Natural Landform that has been around Mars since it was created.

The Face of Mars is located in Cydonia in Mars. Since Mars is mostlikely cloudy, the photos were taken when Mars was cloudless and was in open in Cydonia. MGS had took enough pictures during those times when it cloudless. Pictures were taking for many reasons. One of the reasons was for taxpayers. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, wanted this to happen for profit. But, some other reasons were to learn about Mars and it's surroundings for the next ship to travel there.

It really wasn't build by aliens nor any other creature out in space. The Face of Mars was made 25yrs ago. No one knows how it was made but it was located in Cydonia on Mars.

The Face, however, is an illusion using the shadows as the eyes, mouth, and the nose. One day in Sept. 1997, MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, had landed onto the Red Planet had confirmed it as a natural landform. Not everyone was satisfied since they wanted more proof for this. It was April '98, cloudy time of year on Mars, where people couldn't use their telescopes to see the Face for themselves. So, on April 8th, 2001, MGS gotten close enough for another look. They've took another picture using a better camera that could see anything clear like a airplane, a truck, or a Egyptian-style pyramids! Once they've gotten the picture, People were satisfied.

Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.",3,1,0.8734585046768188

There are scientifically proven facts that the Face is a natural landform. The Face was first spotted and taken a picture of by NASA's spacecraft Viking 1 in 1976. Ever since then people have been curious to find out more and more about this discovery. It is proven that the Face is a mesa. The Face only looks like a face because shadows creates the appearance of facial features.

The Face is proven by NASA that it is only a mesa. The article states ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia..."" This shows how there are other mesas and they are known for being in the same area as the Face. This is not the only example that the Face is a natural landform, the Face doesnt even have actual feautures of a human face.

There is also proof that the Face does not have the structure of a human face. The article states NASA captioned a image of the Face stating ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth."" This proves that shadows make the appearance of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, the Face does not have the structure of these facial features.

In 1998 NASA sent another ship to look at the face on mars agine. This time it loooked differnt is kinda looks more clearer than the other one. Then when they took back the pictuers of they face they were amazed what had happened to it.

In 2001 NASA sent more people to get pictures of the face with better camura. When the picuters returned to NASA they were stuned. The face looked so much differnt than the pictuer in 1998 it looked like somthing hit it. Then when the people came back to earth they heard about the news and the picture got released into the public. Then something happened someone leared that it was not a face on mars it's just a rock building.

When NASA learned that it was just a rock building they started to loose hope with the face on mars but, something werid happend. When the wired thing happend they wanted to know what happend? When they saw the pictures they noticed that half of the face was smashed. Then they pointed out agine that the face was destryed but it still waan't really a face it was agine a stone builing. Then there was still no hope to find the face in the desert.

After that there was the last trip to see if the face on mars was a face or a stone building?

When they got to mars they took pictures and tryed to see if they could take a picture of it to close. Then they relesed that it only really was a rock building or thing. When they learned that they stared to give up on the subject and just forget about it. Then when there was only a littel group of people who still think there something on mars they kept on going and never give up.

739fc35,"The Face on Mars

""The Face on Mars"" is a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head,"" as NASA stated in 1976.

Many know that it is just a natural landform like on earth, but some believe that the Face was created by aliens.

The Face is nothing more than a natural landform because we have landforms like it here on earth, photographic evidence reveals a natural landform, and there is no evidence that the Face was built by life outside of earth.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform, just like we have on earth.

Jim Garvin, who is the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, knows that the Face is just another landform.

""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" he said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

This is just one piece of evidence that the Face cannot be anything more than a natural landform--because it has many characteristics of a landform here on earth.

A second reason that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform is because of the images taken in 2001 by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).

Twenty five years after its first photographs, clearer, higher resolution photos of Face came from MGS.

From the 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 photograph versus the 1.56 meters per pixel in the 2001 photograph, there is clearly enough evidence that the Face on Mars is just a natural land formation similar to a mesa.

The rises and dips in the landform just resemble the shape of eyes, nose, and mouth of a human face and nothing more, but after seen more clearly, cracks and crevaces in the land prove that the Face is just a natural landform.

Those who believe that the Face on Mars was built by aliens have nothing to base their beliefs on other than the fact that the landform resembles a face.

No evidence whatsoever suggests that the Face was built by supernatural life.

On the other hand, photos--and common sense itself--prove that the landform is just another landform like we have on earth.

The passage itself proves the authenticity of the landform.

It says that ""thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.

There was no alien monument at all,"" proving that the Face is only a landform.

To conclude, no evidence suggests that the Face on Mars is anything more than a natural landform.

The Face has characteristics of a landform on earth, and images of it from 2001 reveal only a landform.

On top of that, those who believe that alien activity is responsible for the creation of the Face have little to no information to base their beliefs on.

In the end, though, we know that the little landform called the Face of Mars is just one of our universe's great mysteries.",4,1,0.8690826892852783
73ba914,"""Umasking the Face on Mars""

If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens I would tell them that it is the way it forms over a period of time that makes it looks like aliens did it. I would be using paragraphs 2-3 and 10-12 to support my reasoning.

In paragraph 3 it states that ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" That is one reason why it supports my reasoning.

In paragraph 2 it states that ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" That's another reason why I picked this paragraph to be in my writing because It tells you the features and what it looks like.

In paragraph 10 it states that ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second like. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. "" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" That's another reason why I also picked this one to talk to you about because it is a fun thing to talk about when it comes to this subject.

In paragraph 11 it states that ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" That's another reason why aliens did make it made itself.

In paragraph 12 it states that ""What the picture actually shows it the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That is the very last reason why aliens did not make that face the planet made it by its own landforms.

73c8e82,"Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". Shadows on the object give ""the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.

The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.

744e5b8,"I believe that the so called face on Mars is just a landform. One reason i believe this is because everytime we took a picture of the ""face"" it looked different. This is because the shadows are at different lengths throughout the day. It also looks different each time because the cameras where becoming more advanced and the images are having less and less pixels.

The reasons i believe that the landform on mars is a landform because shadows change how the object looks, the cameras were bad and were very pixelated making parts of the photograph look blurry, and mesas are very common in Cydonia. Like on Earth shadows can make objects look like something they aren't. Like I said mesas are very common in the area so there is a good chance that it is a mesa.

Because of this information thats supports the claim that the face is a mesa i believe that the claim is true. The technology over the time of taking the photos became more advanced therefore the cameras were able to take less pixelated images. When the last image was posted to a website in 2001 many of the people who thought the landform was a face or an alien artifact stopped believing.

746e361,"The landform on Mars is quite interesting, and there could be many thoughts on how it came to be. With already known knowledge and knowledge that is soon to come, people like to guess. With the already known knowledge, we know so far that aliens have not been found on Mars yet, therefore they couldn't have possibly made a mark.

Like Earth, Mars is a planet just with different features. Our earth forms mountains and hills due to erosion and our plate tectonics. It's naturaly formed by the planet. No living organism created the rocky mountains. So with that, it is able to be assumed that Mars can form it's own hills and mountains as well.

Something else that is credible is that no life form has been found on Mars yet. Who knows if Mars has erosion or layers under it's surface that is able to move? On

Mars, there is no life that could have possibly created such a piece of art. Earth itself makes beautiful art like the Grand Canyon and

Niagra Falls. Naturaly, these landforms formed by Earth. Nobody knows exactly if Mars is able to do that, but with the relyablility we have today it has not proven that any life form could have created the Face on Mars.

If these markings were to be made by some kind of living organism, we almost certainly would know about it. Especialy with all of the high technology we have today, we would be able to see any kind of life. Maybe if we explored undernethe the surface of Mars, then we could get more information to see if Mars could have created it or if these aliens are living undernethe.

It's a great way to assume how it happened by comparing Mars to Earth, but it could also be irrelevent. Earth, unlike Mars, has an atmosphere. It keeps in heat, but changes. Earth also has water and life. If this were to be a cause of the rocks, hills, and mountains, then it could be said that the face on Mars was not created by erosion, water, or anything like that. It takes a lot of studing and even more knowledge to figure it out, but aliens don't seem to be logical quite yet.",3,1,0.7606793642044067

If this was a face, would it have been the only living being on Mars.

If it were a face, it does clearly resemble that of a human, but no human has been to Mars.

You could say maybe humans began civilization on Mars but we had to leave for whatever reason and when we got to Earth we suddenly went into a stone age, and that face was from a human that died on Mars, but that would have to have been millions of years ago and the ""face"" would no doubt have been buried in the sand.

If you are not yet convinced that this is just and landform that coincidentally looks like a face yet, then here are some more arguments.

In paragraph 7, it talks about how they took a much better quality photo of the ""face"" and it appeared to be nothing more than a landform.

You could also argue that maybe the sand covered up the facial features, but why wouldn't it have done that a long time ago?

Wouldn't that mean that whatever kind of species it was died recently?

If so why don't we see millions or thousands or hundreds or even tens of this species?

Was it the only one ever to exist on the planet.

If it Mars were sustainable for this creature, then it would clearly be sustainable enough for more creatures to appear just like it.

Also NASA scientists are no doubt more qualified then any average citizen when it comes to topics about other planets, and even they appear to think that it is just a landform.

This article will explain why this ""Face"" is not an alien artifact.

About 25 years ago a spacecraft oribting mars called the viking 1 was searching for landing spots for its sister ship called the viking 2. In 1976 Viking 1 took a picture of something that had the appearnace of a face, NASA could not explain it at first. After some research that mission controllers came to the conclusion that is was another martian mesa, they were common in the region of Cydonia on planet mars. A few days later NASA decided to unveil the image for all to see. The face on mars became a huge hit in pop culture it was featured in movies, books, magazines, and even on radio talk shows. Many people begain to think the face was evidence of aliens on mars and were confused because NASA would want to hid ethe evidence of aliens on mars. ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars."" Although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, Photographing Cydonia became a tp priority. NASA took pictures of the face every chance they had. In 1988 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and took good pictures of the face. When the photo was seen it was proof of no alien life it was just a landform on mars. Many were not satisfied and wanted more proof so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take more detailed pictures. When the scientist got the picture it shows a martian butte or mesa and the scientist compared it with the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of idaho in the american west. When it comes down to it there is no alien life on the planet of mars and the face is nothing but a landform with the appearance of a face. I hope this article has helped you decide if you think it is alien or a landform. ",2,1,0.9105531573295593
74b1e76,"On May 24, 2001, NASA discovered a large, shadowy figure that resembled the shape of a human face on the surface of Mars. Some are to believe this figure was created by ""aliens"". Was it? Or is this mysterious likeness just something as normal as a natural landform?

Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976. The camera's absolute maximum was 43 meters per pixel. By looking at the photograph, you wouldn't be able to make a definate conclusion about what exactly the figure was and how it got on the surface of Mars.

Later, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor was able to capture a photograph with an absolute maximum of 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters per pixel like in the 1976 Viking photo. The picture was ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. Jim Garvin even said, ""You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

Garvin also mentioned that they don't pass over the figure as a face very often and that what the image actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West.

Like I mentioned in the first paragraph; some are to belive this figure was created by aliens. Was it? Well, after receiveing all of NASA's evidental information, I would have to say it was not. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform created by natural causes; not aliens or even previous human life that may have once exhisted on the mysterious planet. People may have been hoping this was the time in history where aliens could've been discovered, but as we can tell, that moment in history is certainly and obviously not now.",3,1,0.7818495035171509
74b2fe5,"What I Think

I dont think the alien made the face because, how could aliens make a face like that and where could they get the materials to make it pop out like that? I think the Face is a natural landform because, first of all, if the aliens crated the mask, how did space scientists find it? Second, how did they get the materials to make the mask? Last but not least, how did the aliens make the face like that? I dont think aliens made that face because how can you posibly believe that aliens are are real? Aliens arent even real because if they were real, their head would not even be like that. Take a really good look at the photo to see who you think made the face. If you take a good look at the face you could tell that the face is made from a real human and not a alien. Where could aliens get sement from to even make the face pop out like that? I dont believe that aliens made a face like that because it is impossible for a type of species to do somehing such like that, aliens arent even real because scientist have been looking for them for a long time and they have not found one yet. That scientifically proves that aliens are not real they might be somewhere hiding or scientists havent found them yet. I dont even think aliens are a species.

74b7fb1,"Have you ever seen anything unusual and thought that it was just a natural landform, but other people thing it was created by extraterrestials? Well, some people argue that the Face on Mars was created by aliens and some people believe that it was created natural. I believe that the Face formed naturally. I believe this because of the camera quantity and the shadows and clouds of the planet.

First, I am going to discuss the camera quality. The quality of the camera is important so that the picture of the Face is clear. When the scientists first took the picture of the Face in 1976, there was an unclear picture. As time went on the cameras got more and more advanced that to the point you could see every detail of the Face. In 2001, when scientists took a clear picture of the Face, they identified it as a mesa, a natural landform in Western America. Also, they said that if there were any other alien landforms like egyptian pyramids that it would show up in the picture. Last, in the passage it states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quote from the passage proves that the Face is a natural landform and not created by aliens. This is how the camera quality prove whether or not the Face was created by aliens or is a natural landform.

Next, I am going to discuss how the clouds and shadows of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform. First, the shadows of Mars gives the Face an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. In the passage it states, ""Huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, mouth."" This shows that the Face is not really a face and it is actually a natural landform. Next, the clouds on Mars can throw off the cameras vision of the face. When the MGS took a picture of the Face when it was cloudly on Mars the picture was unclear and scientists could not see the Face in detail. Although, in 2001 when the MGS explored Mars, it was not cloudy. MGS was able to get a clear picture of the Face and scientists identified it as a natural landform and not an alien creation. This is how the shadows and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform.

Finally, the camera quality, shadows, and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform. The better the camera quality the more proof there is to say that the Face is a natural landform. Also, without the clouds and shadows of Mars, the Face is easily identified as a natural landform. To conclude, this is how the quality of the camera, shadows, and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform.",4,1,0.9017277956008911
75296c2,"In my opinion I think that this ""Face on Mars"" is a landform. For one, we have never seen an alien or have any trace of aliens. I think that we think it has something to do with aliens because it is in a face shape like us. But honestly, huge rocks or huge meterorites could have caused it to look like that. Also there hasn't been any sight of life on Mars because of the conditions. If humans couldn't live on Mars, then how could aliens?

Huge rocks and huge meters crash into the planets and moon all the time. I honestly think that it is the rocks or something in space that caused this. I don't think that there is any sight or any posssible way that there could be life or aliens on this planet.

When they went to go see again and go check out the ""Face on Mars"" they didn't see anything, there was no alien monument. They also talk about how it is very hard to be able to see the ""Face on Mars"" I think that if there was a possiblity that it could be a bout aliens and this ""Face on Mars"" appeared because of aliens then there wouldn't onlly be one face. I think that if there were tons of face looking landforms then maybe there could've been life on mars for aliens. Since there were no other faces that could've been another alien, I don't think that there is a way that this has anything to do with aliens.

It also states in the passge that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. He states that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids that you would be able to see them.

If you could make things larger and see farther into the picture than I think there would've been more to find. There wasn't any other sign of aliens found in the picture. I think aliens for sure having nothing to do with this, but at the same time they could have.

I think if scientists really were able to go and see this i think they should study the face more often to see if there is any evidence of any other alien or any other landform that has to do with them. My personal opinion is that it has nothing to do with aliens.   ",3,1,0.8647311329841614

A lot of people make conspiracy theories, and a lot of people come to believe they are true and they start making false accusations against the government not revealing discoveries to the public.

A global surveyor orbiting Mars captured an image of a face like figure on the surface of mars, NASA thought it was a mesa. It turned out to be a rock that had formed on the surface of mars.

NASA revealed the image to the public, The image caused an outbreak of conspiracy theories. There were a lot of debates on whether NASA was hiding something from the public or if they were being truthful. The majority of the public thought that NASA was hiding the truth, and they thought that the face was the result of foreign life forms.

7546cf9,"If i was to wrok for NASA and one of my co workers argued that the face on mars was created by alieans, i would argue that it is just a landform. The reason i say its just a landform is because we dont have any proof that aliens made it.It only looks like a face sometimes because in the article it says ""formed by a shadow givivng the illusion of eyes"". If Aliens made it why wouldn't they just give it eyes in the fist place instead of using shadows.

People made up that aliens created the human face landform.If NASA didn't say anything the public would't people wouldn`t even know about it. They told the oublis about it so they can draw attention towrds the Mars. In paragraph 3 it says ""the authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage te publis and attract to attention.'' And why would aliens make a human face without completing it them using shadows as eyes, but what if there were no shadows when viking one came a round it would look like a normal hill.

My final thoughts about sombody arguing with me that aliens made a face i would tell them its just hill. The only reason i wouldn`t agree with them is because they dont have any information to support it. But if they had enough claims to support what he said i cab see where he is coming from.

7570efd,"Do you believe in aliens or life on other planets? A face shape was found on Mars and many are calling it an alien marking. It is proven that it is not from aliens through research and pictures, however people still continue to protest. Our scientists at NASA have already studied the mark as soon as it was spotted. Also, if the so called ""face marking"" was from aliens, NASA would be all over it.

First of all, the scientists at NASA have already studied and observed the marking as soon as we were notified and pictures were sent to us. Later, finding out that it turned out to be nothing more than a natural made landform. The quote, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia"" (2) shows how we found out really what it was. The quote, ""a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see"" (3) shows how NASA was sharing with the people the truth behind what the marking was. We wished we could have been able to do more research on aliens, but that was only capable if the life on Mars were real.

Lastly, if there were real aliens, we would be open about it and do research immediately. The quote, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" (5) shows how we wish that the aliens did exist so we could learn more about life on Mars. The quote ""but the sensation was short lived"" (2) shows how we were sad that the landmark wasn't alien made. We would have liked it if we would have been able to research the landmark about aliens but unfortunatly it wasn't caused by aliens. If the marking was real, we have been proud to announce that and would have not keepen it a secret.

Others might argue that our team at NASA are lying to the public but that is not true. They say that we are hiding the information from the public. The quote, ""some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars"" (5) shows how other people have different thoughts on what we found. Another quote, ""NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists"" (5) shows how people begin to believe and think that we're lying to them about our discovey. However, Our scientists would be thrilled if it really was aliens, starting ancient civilization on Mars.

Some believe that the marking on Mars was an alien marking. We, scientists, have proof that it was not. We have done plenty of research as proof to our conclusion. If the mark was real, NASA would have already discovered all sorts of information on life on Mars. I and the other scientists at NASA believe one day we will discover alien life form but May 24, 2001 just wasn't that day.",5,1,0.8098239898681641
7573c96,"The face on Mars is just a natural landform. Their's really no existense of aliens, because theres no proof of them. The face is just a landform that was created with Mars. On Earth we have landforms that look like faces and other things that were created with Earth. There's also no proof that there's life on Mars, becuase there really isn't life on Mars.

The existence of aliens is false, humans and animals are the only life forms out there pretty much. If there were proof of aliens then why arn't they on Earth then? Aliens never made that on Mars, that face was created when Mars was. NASA just used the face to get money, because this face was starred in a Hollywood film, it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store check out lines for 25 years. Then after that they really didn't care for the face anymore. Everyone was not really satisfied with the face on Mars.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-- landforms common around the American West. Garvin a scientist even says that it reminds him of the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also says ""That's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

As you can see the face was never created or made by aliens. The face was created with mars. In the story, it even says that the landform was basically created with Mars. So in fact there is no existence of aliens and there is no life on Mars.

In the ending of the story, it basically says the face is just a landform, it tells the height and everything about it. They even say that they don't pass over the face that much anymore. So it's just a true fact that the face a landform, they even said it was just a natural land form.",3,1,0.8851218223571777

Also wouldn't it of kept it's shape for more than 25 years or do you think that is just a sequence that happens to things over time. You never know if they are more advanced then us and can keep all of their stuff in ship shape and if it was a alien it would of stay and not changed.

One reason is as simple as can be and that is that there is no proof that aliens have ever touched foot on to one of the galaxy's planets. The Face is just a natrual landform.

In addition, scientists have already come to the conclusion that the Face is just a Martian mesa. ""Only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah"" (2). This proves that it is just unusal for a Martian mesa to look like the one on Mars. ""Martian mesa, common enough""(2) this proves that Martian mesa's are common and not unusal.

Plus in the pictures the Face is not the only mesa around. There are 10 different mesas. If there are ten mesas in one picture of Mars who knows how many mesas are on Mars(5). It is just a fluke that one mesa happens to look like an Egpytian Pharoah.

Also Is says in the story that ""what the picture actaully shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mess--landforms common around the American West""(12). Garvin says ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho""(12). There is buttes and messas on Earth what makes conspiarcy therorists think that there can not be natrual ones on Mars to. The fact the conspiracy theorists actaully belive that aliens built the Face is a joke.

The Face is a natrual landform on Mars that happens to look like a face. We know this becasue scientists have proven it. We also know this because there are messas on planet earth.

and then he says he read in paragraph 8 that no one was satisfied so we continued to debate so it did not end and my friend Bill said that at the end of paragraph 8 they said perhaps said the skeptics thier were alien marking hidden by haze.

I have several claims to support my argument that the Face is a natural landform. Many people believed that the Face was created by aliens, but have they seen the aliens? How would they know that the aliens did it if they didn't see them do it? What if it's just a illusion and peole think it's a face? They dont have enough proof.

First of all, mesas are common in Cydonia. As the text says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" The shadows made it look like the landform had eyes, a nose, and a mouth. These are just shadows. Only afew Scientists thought that the Face was an Alien artifact.

Secondly, they took pictures and said that the face was just a landform. After they first saw the face, they wanted to take pictures as soon as possible. NASA flew the Mars Global Surveyor over Cydonia. As the article says, "" Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos."" That means those pictures were more accurate. These photos resulted that the Face was just a natural landform.

Lastly, scientists said that it was the same as landforms around the American west. Mission controller, Garvin, said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This is showing that the landforms here, are on Mars. Aliens didn't make our landforms though. The Face is actually a mesa or a butte and not an Alien artifact.

Some might say, that the second time, in 1998, the camera had to look through the clouds in order to see the face. This is true but, Mission control prepared to look again and went back in 2001. This time the camera had absolute maximum resolution. The text states that, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking Photo."" This camera saw very clearly and saw that it was a mesa or a butte.

This object in space is just another accidental landform that happened to form there. There are not any alien landforms. There is no actual proof that the aliens have built this structure. Many strange occurances happen. This just happened to be one of them.

This is a common thing that occurs on mars. This is just a coincidence that it happened to look like it was an egyptian person. Up close this big rock is just a plain rock. It is just the sun shining on it that makes it look like it is a face. Thats all that it is.

Within our article on passage 9 it says that it was super hard to find this one. So that means that there is not that many of this oddly shaped landform. If you really think about it if there were really aliens there they would build more than just one.

There needs to be more proof that the aliens built that. This is also common on earth. Some people say that they can see a celebritty in there food. Really it is just some bad shaped food item.

We just need some cold hard proof of it. For us it just looks like a big rock that has been there forever. Sure at first it looked suspicious, we did some reasearch on it the realized it was a mesa. There is no need to get so over excited about it. In passage 12 it tells you that we even see these thing on Earth.

7690736,"Have you ever wondered if this ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens? Well, I am sorry to dissapoint you however, because it was, in fact, not created by aliens. There is much evidence to support that it was not created by aliens.

To assume simply because a rock formation looks like a face that it is an alien artifact is illogical. Martian mesa's are infact very common where the Face of Mars was discovered. It just happened that one of them happened to have weird shadows that made it appear to be a face.

In 1976, the quality of the cameras that took the first photo of the Face of Mars on the Viking 1 were inadequate. On the Viking 1 photo, every pixel was 43 meters, meaning the photo would be very distorted. In 1998, it was taken again with a better, yet still not great, camera that would reveal the rock formation merely only looks like a face because of the weird shadow. In 2001, the photo was taken by a MGS with a good quality camera. The camera on this MGS had quality of 1.56 meters per pixel. Meaning if there were structures or a Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see it. This proves that the rock formation was not created by aliens.

The martian mesa is very common in the region where the Face of Mars was found, yet Garvin says ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He continues by saying ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."" It can be proved that this is not an alien structure as, not only is it common in that region in mars, it is also common in Western America.

There is strong evidence that proves that this 'Face of Mars' is not an alien structure, and instead simply a very common martian mesa that just happened to have shadows that made it appear to be a egyptian face.

when scientist decribed this face they seen on mars, ""A shadowy likeness of a human face"" ""an enormous head"" ""Was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called -Cydonia"", yes it does sound like it would be an alian based on how theyre decribing it, but wouldnt you think it could be anything other then an alian?, i think so, not everything with a shadowy like figure of a human has to be an alian, it could be anything really.

I strongly believe that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform, because we have almost like it on Earth, there are no signs of alien life in the pictures or scientific research, and the pictures taken, show that there are shadows that create a facial look in the natural landform.

First off, we have a natural landform located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The one on Mars is almost equivalent to the one here on our planet. In paragraph 12, it states, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is plainly saying that the one on planet Mars could just be a lava dome of some sort just like the one here on Earth.

Also, there are no signs of alien life through the pictures taken from the cameras. How could this alien life we talk about create this Face, when there is no evidence of this alien life? The pictures were taken mutiple times in different years to make sure of this. They had people questioning, so they did further research. For example in paragraph number eight, ""...peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by daze."" The skeptics that wanted the benifits of actually finding alien life wanted actual proof that it is merily only a mesa. They ende up being proved that it is only a mesa.

To also say, the photographs that were studied have been intereprted. They have been interepreted to the point that they can pin-point certain material. They proved that by when they said that is merily shadows that the mesa has, from depth, that create the face like look. For example in paragraph number three, it states ""The captain noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" The images were showing that there were some dips in this mesa that created it to look as if it were an actual face.

There are people who say,"" Just because the cameras say that there is no life on Mars, doesn't mean that there is no life."" To prove that wrong, it states in paragraph number 11, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Also later on in the paragraph, ""...if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian pyramids... you could see what they were."" Meaning if there was any 3-d image, it would have been picked up and been able to ananlyze. The Face is obviously a natural landform that has been there from the beginnging. Also, people used to say and still say "" look at the man on the moon."" There is no man on the moon, there is a mesa that was shaped that looks like a Face. The Face n Mars is just another incident of what happend with the moon.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform like the one here on earth and the one that appears on the face of the moon. I strongly hold my belief that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform because there is almost an exact replica here on earth, there are no sientific signs of life, and the pictures that were taken, that have been analized, show that shadows create the face. Will there one day be life somewhere else besides Earth. I will never know, but as of right now and the scientific records that are based on this essay, this Face that people say might be made by aliens is not logical. This Face on Mars is a mesa. Once you can find scientific data that proves there is life on earth, than everything said for years ca be proven wrong. But as of right now, no.",5,1,0.8607131838798523

First, the ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon, so of course there will be fasle information in magazines and etc. Second, What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa landforms common around the American West. Third, Mars Global Surveyor also drew close enough for a second look. When the first time on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera MOC team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, realing.. a natural landform. Like all the others are coomon landforms around the American West. There was no alien monument after all. But not everyone was satisfied yet. Others still not believing there were no alien monument. Prepaps said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze. On April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an ectraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxumum resolution.

76f8404,"Has anyone ever noticed that face shaped rock in Mars? Well back in 1976, some NASA Vikings saw a rock in Mars. They were all talking about it and wanted to know what it was. They told a few people and scientists. They came to a conclusion and made some guesses about what it was. Some said it was an alien's face and some said it was a man's face. It is now 2001, and the argument is currently still going on. Now I'm going to tell you from my perspective whats going on now.

So I'm a scientist, I'm currently in outerspace with other astronauts. We see what everyone is talking about. It does look like a face. From people's opinion it looks like an alien made the face, a real person, and other exotic ideas. Honestly from my opinion it looks like the natural planet. Of course it looks like a face, but I don't think a man or an alien just came and stuck their face in the planet. Like come on people, let's be real.

It is now October 24, 2002. Today we go back up into space, we go back in 3 hours. Right now I'm having a conversation with one of the astronauts, John, he thinks an alien made the face. This is what he asks me ""How could you not think that is an alien's face?"" My response: ""Because the face is no where near shaped like an alien's face. There probably is life on that planet, but their face isn't in the planet."" His response: ""Oh come on, that is totally an alien's face."" My response: ""Look at the the way the face looks, it doesn't look anything like an alien."" His response: "" Well if it's not an alien then what do you think it is?"" My response: ""I think that was just naturally formed there.""

His response: ""How so?"" My responese: ""Look at the picture, it looks natural. Also, you know all of those big wholes in the earth, they were naturally formed, no one just came an dug that big of a whole in the earth. If so, they would probabbly be stuck inside the whole."" His response: ""You might be right, but that still doesn't convince me that the face was naturally formed."" Then I said ""Okay John, how did the alien's face get in the planet? The ground there looks awfully hard. So I don't think it would be possible for anyone or anything to make a face print in it.""

""I don't know how, the alien does know."" Then I said ""Exactly you don't know how it got there. The alien does, if he did it. All I can say for myself is that the alien didn't do it, nor a man. I believe that it was naturally formed. So I'll let you think what you want to think."" A few hours later, after him thinking about it, he came to the conclusion that maybe it was naturally formed.",4,1,0.8364284038543701

I agree with them for what they have said in paragraph 7 which was ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.

In pragraph 12 it says that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West"".

Have you seen the face on Mars? Do you think it was made from aliens? well i will tell you why the theory that it was made by aliens is false. I will also tell you why it is a natural land form. Also I tell you further what the scientists have found out about the three pictures taken.

There is a theory htat the face on Mars firts photographed in 1976 was not made by aliens. First many people think that the face looks like an egyptian pharoh and was made by aliens. Although there are some people belive that aliens do egsist and that the aliens did this face there is no true evedance that aliens do eggsist and also that the aliens did this face. Another thing people are saying is that the NASA is hiding things from the public but the NASA tells evertything to the public about teir investigation so there for there is no true evedance that the NASA is hiding things about their invesigations to the public.

The face on mars is a natural land form because there is no true evedance that the aliens built htis face as a matter of fact years after there have two more pictures taken of the face on mars one in 1998 and the last one in 2001. In fact there is a scientist that even said that the face was not made by aliens the scientist's name is Jim Garvin. Jim Garvin studied the pictures of the face on Mars and said that there was no alien monument after all. There for that prove that the face on Mars was not made by aliens. There are still some people not satifed with his answer. Garvin even compared the face on mars with buttes or mesas here on earth. Garvin also said that these kinds of land forms are common areound the American West. Garvin also stated that it reminded him most of the Middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

The face on Mars caused many theory like that some peopl said that the face on Mars was made by aliens. here is what scientists have found out. Once they NASA took the first picture comotion started like the one were they say that it was made by aliens, but the scientist Jim Garvin said that if it indeed it was and egyptian-style pyramid or even small shack you be able to see what they were. There are three pictures of this face on mars every picture more enhanced than the other and indeed scientists like Jim Garvin say the the face on Mars was not made by alians and it is a natural land form like a mesa.

In conclusion there are people that say that the face on Mars was built by aliens and that it is a face if an egiptian pharoh, but scientists have answered this question and they say that it is just a natural land form like a mesa. So what do you think? Do you think that the face on Mars was made by aliens? belive what you think but acirding to evedance it was not made by aliens . What do think?",4,1,0.8995004296302795
77387d5,"In May of 1976, a space ship that was looking for a landing site on Mars snapped a very interesting photo. The blurry photo clearly resembled a human face. The picture led a lot of people to think that the structure was build by aliens. However, this statement has been proven wrong by scientific evidence. The structure wasn't built by aliens because a more up to date photo of the same spot has proven that it is just a mass of rock.

Up until around 1998, a large amount of people believed that the image of the blurry face was evidence of an alien civilization. On April 5, 1998 however, scientists were finally ale to take another picture of the same spot with more up to date technology. The new image revealed that it was just a bunch of rocks.

Scientists say that the blurry face could've been caused by a thick haze that was on that part of the planet when the original photo was taken. They said it was a cloudy day when the photo was taken, so the fae could've been created by the combination of the clouds and the shadows.

Now that a more up to date photo was released, some people have dropped the whole idea of an alien civilization, however, some people still believe that there could still be alien life elswhere. This could be true, but as for the blurry face photo, it was all just a trick of the eye.             ",3,1,0.775091290473938

NASA descoverd that the face wasn't actaully a real face. It was a land form it was proven that it was a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. Also it was formed by shadows which made an illusion of the face to have eyes, a mouth, and a nose like a human does.

Also Michael Malin and his very powerful camera took pictures of the face. He discovered that it was really a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. But poeple didnt believe that it actually was a land form because it was very cloudy near the planet mars. So Malin and his team, took another picture they discovered that the landforms were actaully common to a landform in America.

However, the face triggered a lot of attention. The face became very popular in America. The face appeared in movies, book, magazines, and also on radio shows. People started to think that the theoy was true because it was featured in things that people see or watch everyday.

In conclusion, The face was proven to be a landform after all. NASA discoverd that it was a rock formation, also Michael Malin and his team saw that it was a landform by conducting a study twice.      ",3,1,0.8573532104492188

While it began to take pictures of the region, it spotted a human-like face. Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.

It has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos. There was no alien monument, only a natural landform. Finally, they gave up.

7802637,"NASA has found a face in Mars. Many say its just natural, but others say its from aliens. A few reasons people say it was created by aliens is its in an odd place, and it has unusal shadows.

One reason that people say aliens created this face on Mars is because where the face is located on Mars is a particularly odd spot. In paragraph 8 it says ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 a cloudy time of year on the Red planet."" Also in paragraph 9 it says ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Gavin. ""In fact, it's hard work."" Mars Global Surveyor is mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km wide stripes.""

Another reason is it has unsual shadows for example in paragraph 1 it says ""When (the Viking spacecraft) it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red planet.",2,1,0.8332877159118652

NASA looked into this ""face"" a lot more. Me and my crew where up all night for days just digging deeper for more information! Finally, after days of reserch I got some feed back. I unveild the images of this thing for all to see. It was seen and proven to be a ''huge rock formation'' . You could argue and say aliens made it. Could aliens make rock? Rock natrually happens for alot of reasons but, aliens isn't one of them ! Is there any proven facts that alliens exsist? No. After 18 long years we finally reveled it as a natrual landform. We proved that through pictures. Its hard to argue with that.

NASA compared ""the face"" to the Middle Butte in the Snake river Plain of Idaho. Aliens didnt creat that. They Aren't real. So what are you going to belive?        ",2,1,0.8676482439041138

Also when looking at the photo you cant really see how large it is but its way to big to be the size of a face, its more the size of a building or larger. You can see its a rectangle shape that appers to be some sort of hill natrully created by the enviorment so saying it looks like a face is really dumb because if you saw a really blured picture of a rock with dirt in the formation of eyes and a mouth, would you call it a face?",2,1,0.5834915637969971
7835426,"I disagree with you that it ""The Face Of Mars"" was formed by aliens. I think it is a landformation that just happens to look like a face. From 1976 to 2001 we have found zero life on Mars. We have made many missions to it and we still have found nothing. Besides those reasons i still disagree with you about it and i do have proof of my reasons why.

The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" tells me that scientist Jim Garvin was one of the men that took the picture of the ""face"" inApril 8, 2001. After Jim takes the picture and tells everyone, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eygptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Jims says this because, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Also there are unusual shadows to make it look like the landform has eyes and a nose. The shadows also made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But you have to remember that these are shadows and they dont tell always make out to what things look like. Sometimes your shadow makes you look taller than what you really seem to be. Shadows also dont always make you look the same either.

Plus Martian Mesa, are common enough around Cydonia. This could be just another Martian Mesa. Also if NASA wishes there was an ancient civilataion on Mars, why would they hide it. If they even thought that the ""face"" could have been formed by aliens im sure that they would want the world to know of there discovery.

In other words im sure NASA would let people know if they even think that the ""face"" could have been formed from aliens. This is like a mountain on Earth that just at a height and where the camera is at or the sun iot just so happens to look like a face. This is an unusual landform but i am very convinced that, that is all it is. ",4,1,0.9036780595779419
7847f8f,"The face you think was created by aliens was not, because we have no evidence of aliens throught all of our travels in space. The face is just a natural landform on Mars. If you think that NASA wants to hide this for their research your wrong. If NASA released that there was alien lifeforms on Mars their funding would be increased by a lot. The photos may look likes the face was created by something, but it is a naturally formed mesa. It looks like a face because the shadows form what look to be like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. If there have been spacecrafts surveying the land on Mars then why have there not been any pictures sent back of alien lifeform.

If the face was created by aliens where, the aliens should be nearby unless they can travel faster than anything the Earth has. The face could not have been created by aliens because there is not any lifeform on Mars that is not microscopic. We havesurveyed Mars several times and not seen anything proving alien liforns except for this face. If there are aliens then there should be more evidence than a face, which is most likely a mesa. If there are aliens and they built this face, it had to mean something to them. If the face meant something to the aliens then they would be found near it. The Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho is a lave dome that takes the place of an isolated mesa and is about the same height as the face on Mars.

In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough to the face to get a good picture. It was a cloudless day, so the picture was very clear. Each pixel measured to about 1.56 meters. The Viking 1 photo measured about 43 meters per pixel. There were no markings on the face from an alien lifeform.

The Mars Global Surveyor looks straight down on the planet taking pictures and sending them to NASA. Since the Mars Global Surveyor only does 2.5 km-wide strips it does not pass over the face very often. Even though it does not pass over the face very often the Mars Global Surveyor covers a lot of land and has not seen any aliens. You have the right to still believe that the face as created by alien lifeform, but I hope these facts changed your point of view on the situation.",4,1,0.911156415939331
786b550,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" a NASA air carft Viking 1 discovered a landformation that looked like a face but scientists proved that it's a mesa. Shadows from Marses clouds or from the atmoshpere could've formed the human like shadow. Theorists are saying that there is life on mars but don't have enough evidence from the article to prove so. NASA is wishing that there was evidence that there was life forms for the sake of their budget. These are some reasons that the conspiracy theorists are wrong.

When the Viking 1 took the photo of the mesa the maritian skies could've been cloudy,or the Viking's camera could've been foggy. Scientists have ruled out the idea that the picture could've been formed by some type of life form on mars. some scientists have concluded that the are is just another mesa. Which is common around Cydonia,but only with unusal shadows to form the human face. these are the reasons that scientists have ruled the area being a mesa.

Here are some more better reasons that prove that the picture from the article is just a mesa. On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin took a better photo of the mesa and uploaded it to a JPL website. But not everyone was satisfied with just this picture, the therorists were stills skeptical about the photo since it was still a little blurry. NASA's mission controller prepared to send another spacecraft to amrs for a better higher resolution photo. These are some better reaosn that scientists have ruled out that there is possible life form on mars.

NASA's misson contoller Garvin explains better reason on why the area is just a mesa and not a alien artifact. The photo that was taken in '98 was during the martiain winter,a cloudy time of the year. The cmaera on board the spacecraft had to peer through whispy clouds. On April 8, 2001 Mailn's team captured another photo of the area on a cloudless day on mars. The camera that Mallin's team used was at it's highest resolution so the picture couldnt be clearer. Garvin say's ""If there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian-style prymaids you would be able to see it!"", Garvins reasoning for this is because during 2001 if you where looking at the photo from a computer you could zoom in three times more to get a better quality picture.

In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" there have been theorists that have concluded that there is alien life form on mars,but only from a simple picture that was taken in 1976. Over the years scientists have been sneding spacecrafts to prove these theorists wrong,which they have. in 1998 sciencists sent a team under the leadership of Michael Mailn to take another photo of the mesa,once they captured the photo theorists still beleived that there was life form on mars. In 2001 NASA's misson controllers sent Mailn's team again to take another better photo during a cloud less day on mars. These are the reasons that the pictured caputed in the article is just a mesa not a alien artifact.",5,1,0.8225113153457642

We will need some proof to stand with this. There is 3 reasons why this is just a natural landform. They can just be like any landform on earth, a face like this can happen anywhere else, and if you believe in aliens are they really capable of doing something like this?

The first reason why this is just a natural landform is because it can also happen on earth. For example, this can happen upon natural sources. Such eratation and it can just be a mesa. Another example is, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough round Cydonia""(2). If this is common than most likely it wouldn't be made by any alien. My last example for this is, most landforms have ways it can look. The landforms can happen anywhere and that wouldnt mean it was caused by an alien. If something like this happened on earth most people would think it was caused by natural thigs like the weather.

My second reason is that things can happen anywhere. For example, another planet my have this but that doesnt mean an alien went and left it there so we could find it. If an alien did this we would be able to find something almost the same as this face. Another example is, ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars""(5). This can be true but if it was an alien wouldnt they do a face they new or reconized. Lastly, in the passage it states that ""There was no alien monument after all"". The picture clearly showed a landform not an alien made monument. In conclusion, things like this can happen in different forms but nobody has proven it was made by an alien.

My last reason for why this is not an alien made monument is because there is no proof that aliens made it. For example, have aliens been proven to exist. No proof was every made that aliens exist in the planet mars. Secondly, how could they build such a thing. if aliens built it than there must be a great amount of them that we did not know about. Lastly, if aliens aready built a Face on Mars why can't they do the same thing on Earth. there is no explanation of they wouldn't be able to do this. In order for the aliens to make something like this that would mean they are capable of this and more but they still haven't been proven to exist.

In conclusion, the face could have been made by something other than aliens. The three reasons explaining why it couldn't have been aliens is it could have been done by nature, it can happen somewhere else, and are aliens capable of this. This can prove that aliens didnt build it, that it could have been made by different things.",3,1,0.6961727738380432

First, I think the Face was caused by natural landforms because the eyes,nose, and mouth were caused shadows. A few days after the the picture, NASA unveilded the image and the caption noted ""Huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" Some scientists still disagree saying it could have been an alien's face. When looking at the picture, there is a shadow of the rock. If it was an alien, why haven't scientist found any other alien like?

Second, the face was formed by a natural landform because when you look at the 2001 picture it is more clear than 1976 or 1998. The clear version shows that it had no eyes,nose, or mouth. Garvin said ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Scientists are able to see pictures closer than before. Garvin also said ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" All the new technologies can get the actually picture more clearly unlike the picture from 1976.

Then, scientists have better technoloy, they are able to go to Mar with new machines. Scientists can even go near the Face with new spacecraft adn get a better picture. Other scietists think that alien markings were hidden by haze. Even if they were hidden, scientists would be able to find it by now.

Finally, the Face was formed by natural landform because it was caused by shadows, and scientists have better technology. On 2001, scientists used a camera which were better than the camera they used on 1976. This is why the Face was formed by natural landform.       ",3,1,0.8286546468734741
78f21f5,"Some people say that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform; is it really? Maybe it is maybe it isn't. Some people think that the Face was an alien formation of some sort. Mars, along with many other planets have strange things on their planet. Whether it's a crater, a wierd looking shape, or whatever it may be. It could just be that it was formed like that. Have you ever been walking outside on a sidewalk or even found something shaped, or formed into something that you have seen before it may be a face carved into a rock, or something carved into cement. Maybe that is what happened with the Face on Mars.

In the text it says, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artiifcat, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen longs years after the Viking missions ended."" In the beginning of the sentence it says that few scientists think that the face was an alien artifact. That might be true but it says that FEW scientists believe the face was alien. Few isn't many.

The text has something else that will amaze some of you, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers, were waiting when the image first apperared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The text said it all. They have a picture to show that the Face is just a natural landform that this planet has made. And it may just look happen to look like a face.

As you read on in the excerpt it says, ""What the picture actually showws is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" The key word is landforms, landforms form all over earth; why not on other planets as well?

Some people may still be conviced that it was an alien artificat that did all this. They may think in their minds that nothing can look that much like a face; some things actually can. Again if you go outside and say you find a rock that is shaped funny, then you pick it up and it looks like a face, unless someone did that on purpose, that was earth's creation.

After reading this article, and writing this, I still am convinced that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. It all makes sense; the pictures, the explantation, the mesa, etc. But again some people may think otherwise that the Face is a alien artifact. ",4,1,0.8905535936355591

Now Garvins' friend said it was a alien that had done this. But there were no proof that aliens did this. They saw no movement on planet Mars. So they called it Martian mesa. On the red planet name as Cydonia. That's where it happened. The face looked like an Egytain Pharaoh. Something funny happened to Mars around/about 25 years ago. Now if I was up there I would start researching this object. Knowing what this was. Where it came from and other things that are important to the shape figure.

So now we know that the people up in space looking at this object are saying it was something that has been there for 25 years, they don't know who done this. All the NASA knows is that they probably know where it came from and things they aren't just saying the full information. So this was about unmasking face on Mars.  ",2,1,0.7861499786376953

Also the suns shadow is one of the only reasons it looks like a face.They are not just common on mars though there common on earth as well. The last picture they took was to the point were you could see rocks small enough to be gravel so it was not made by aliens or they would have left something behind.

On April 8th, 2001 it was a cloudless summer day they rolled the space craft 25 degrees to center the face in. The took a picture 3 times bigger than the last. Each pixel

spans 1.56 meters but the old picture taken in 1976

is only 43 meters per pixel. So if there was anything in the picture you could see what they are.

NASA would not keep this a secret because it would benfit them. More people would likely fund them because they want to know more about the aliens. Plus we are NASA scientist we have seen the information first hand.

So in conclusion there is no doubt that ""The Face"" is not something made by an alien but it is just a land formation.We have pictures and there was just the rock and ground.Also Jim Garvin says ""it reminds me of the Snake River Plain of Idaho.",2,1,0.8507910966873169

Hundereds of people think that there was a human head on Mars, but from what astronomers had to say about it, it was the truth. In 1976, NASA got their first look at the ""face"" on Mars. A couple days later NASA relased the image of the ""face"" to the public the caption was simple as it states in the text, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" After that, it was a pop icon, attracting people into learning more about this planet.

The ""Face on Mars"" became very popular when it came to scaring humans. According to the text it states ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" In films, as always, Hollywood would ""tweak"" the truth to have more people come and see the movie. This was partly the cause of people believing that there is life on mars. However, astronomers are saying that there could have been life on Mars because, of dry river and lake beds on the surface of The Red Planet. Still, that does not prove that there were marshans.

Astronomers are still trying to convince people that there is not life on Mars. According to the text it states ""What the picture actually shows ins the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" This is showing what it really looks like. Besides, from background knowledge it is not possible for a human to live on Mars. There is no oxygen for us to breathe, no water, and no food. Nothing.

Technology has advanced in the past 25 years, showing us clearer pictures in space. This is incuding the ""face"" on Mars. It will forever be a mystery, but from what astronomers have said it will always be a rock formation.                        ",4,1,0.815300464630127
793e363,"Did you ever think the face on Mars was made by aliens? Sorry to break it to you, but it wasn't. You may be thinking either I am really crazy or really smart. Don't worry I have evidence from the article to back up my reasoning. I don't think the face on the moon was created by aliens because the face is surrounded by landforms, the pictures weren't as good as they are now, and when the picture was taken it wasn't under the best conditions. Which leads me into my first reason.

I don't think the face on Mars was made by aliens because the face is surrounded by landforms. I think this because of many reasons. One of which is because the article says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, buttes and mesas are landforms common around the American West."" The next piece of evidence to support this is that there is another landform next to it that looks like the same type of landform. Where there are landforms there are usually more than one example of them.

The next reason I don't think the face on Mars was made by aliens is because the cameras weren't as good as they are now. It was 1976 when that picture was taken. Technology has advanced a lot since then. We have laptops, cell phones, slim computers, early stages of robots, and even tablets with greater processing power than space shuttles that landed on the moon. Cameras have also progressed a lot. The cameras we have now can zoom in and see you armhair from fifty feet away! That's the second reason I don't think the face on Mars wasn't made by aliens.

The last reason I don't think the face on Mars was made by aliens is the pictures were under some of the worst conditions. For example, the sky was clouded, the cameras weren't very good, and it is very hard to target Cydonia. Once they fixed most of those conditions you could clearly tell that the face was actually a landform.

In conclusion, the face on Mars can only be a landform. Once again, this is because the face is surrounded by landforms, the pictures weren't as good as they are now, and the picture was taken under some of the worst conditions. That's why I think the face on Mars wasn't made by aliens.",4,1,0.8838434219360352

Another example from the text that makes me believe that it wasn't made by aliens is that, ""People think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars,"" I believe this supports the claim that there is no proof of aliens because if there was then NASA would have already put in the papers so that could get money to go and explore Mars but, since they haven't put out any information about Mars obviously they haven't found anything to prove that there is life on Mars.

The second reason I believe that it was not aliens who made the face is because the astronauts might have just taken the photo when the shadows were in the right place.

NASA used their new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from Mars Global survey spacecraft reveal the face on Mars and the face was really a mesa. A mesa is an lava dome. On a JPL websit the revealed that it was a natural landform but not everyone was satisfied. On April 1998 the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face.

And the evidence shown was of the Face on Mars is that it's a natural landform. That's my three reasons why the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

In space there are a lot of mysterious things out there and unusual shadows are one of them. NASA unveiled the Face on Mars for all to see. The caption under the photo said ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"". NASA is basically saying that its a big rock formation that looks like a human head because of shadows. That's one of my reasons why the Face on Mars is a natural landform.

My second reason why its a natural landform is the technology/camera. In 1976 technology wasn't at it's best back then. But, the Viking 1 captured a photo of what is predicted to be a Face on Mars. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxiumum resolution"". Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

My final reason why the Face on Mars is a landform is because it is a landform. Scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Also the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West.

First, after NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the image caption said,"" huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This tells us that right away NASA never thought it was anything casued by aliens. Also, in paragraph 5, the texts states, ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars - evidence that NASA would rather hide."" But when you think about it, this wouldn't make much since. Defenders of the NASA budget wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars because it would help out their cause for NASA.

Next, NASA sent more scientists into space to do more research. When the Scientists got there on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a photo ten times sharper than the first Viking photos. Then in the article, it says, "" Thousads of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

Some scientists believed it was an alien articraft, but it probably was but i think it wasnt. I just think it was a rock shaped like a face to me.

Well, from the evidence given, it is very likely that the superstions are false, and the Face is just a landform.

The Face was captured again on April 5, 1998 by the MOC which gave a sharper photo. That alone was enough proof to show that the Face is just a landform. Even though it was very cloudy around Mars around that time, it would still be difficult to pass over the Face. The MOC scans over the planet with narrow 2.5 km-wide strips which would make it very hard to miss over the Face.

Lastly on April 8, 2001 NASA captured an extraordinarry photo of the Face. It was a cloudless, summer day which squelched all objections of it being too cloudy around Cydonia to capture a good photo. Each pixel in the photo spans 1.56 meters, whereas the best photo in 1976 only had 43 meters per pixel. The photo was so spectacular that you could zoom in 3 times the pixels size, so even if there were life, small shacks, or pyramids on Mars, you'd be able to see them.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landform. the 2001 photo gives enough evidence that even if there were life or monuments on Mars you would be able to see them. The photo in 1998 was also a good photo, so good that it would be hard to even miss over the Face. Also, even if there were life on Mars NASA would have no reason to hide it, it would help their company more than it would be a detriment to it.

I believe that the Face is a natural landform. The large landform on Mars is very similar and naturally made like landforms on earth and even more specifically the American West. A very good example of this is the Middle Butte in the Snack River Plain of Idaho.

The landforms such as the Middle Butte in the Snack River Plain of Idaho are made from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Knowing how the formation in Idaho is formed increases the evidence showing how easy it would be for Mars to have a similar landform. it is very well a natural landform, just on a different planet. Mars is such a similar planet to earth that the lantural landforms could be, and in this case are, very similar.

No matter what you believe, rather it is a natural formation or made by an ancient life form or aliens, all the evidence and proof points to, and proves, that the Face on Mars is in fact, just a natural landform that is most likely an equivalent of a bette or mesa.",2,1,0.8498983383178711

The face is ether a buute or mesa landforms because it is common around the American West. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Sanke River Plain of Idaho.

For example it says ""A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all of us to see. The caption noted ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head"" this is why I think it is a landform.

Another reason I think it is a landform is because as we got closer to the ground of Mars is got clearer and clearer. It came out to be a mesa. In the 70's they didn't have to best cameras so it looked a little blury and came out to be a face.

As cameras got better and better it became clearer and clearer. If they were to do it today they would really see what it was.

In the article when the author starts talking about the Face on Mars they give many reasons as to why the Face is a natural landform. One way you know that the Face is a natural landform is because 18 years after the original picture was taken NASA went back and took newer pictures that showed that it looked as if it was just a big boulder on Mars. In the article it states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.... revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that the Face was just one or a couple of years, but it went away and is now shown as a flat rock surface. Another way you know that it is a natural landform is because in the article it says that when the original NASA picture was taken they captioned it saying that it was a rock formation.

This explains that even though the people at NASA also thought that it looked like a face they still said that it was just a rock formation that happened to look like a human face.

I think people are going crazy. People are watching to many cartoons and they are starting to think that aliens are real. People on talk shows, books, and magazines are talking about it. There is a face on mars and they think it's aliens creating them. I think they it just happend from natural landform. To me it looks like an Egyptian-style pyramid. I didn't see any aliens in the photograph. There aren't homes where they could live. At first scientists thought that it was a Martian mesa, because that is common around that area.

What do you think about the whole thing? I think that people need to go up to mars and really see what is going on. So, we can go and show everyone this there aren't any aliens, and they are just a myth. ",2,1,0.7921367287635803

Need some reasons well here is three. They are doing this for money,they want to make it popular,and it took them a long time to make the very last conclusion.

In the article ""unmasking the face on mars"" people are saying that they see a face form with eyes,nose,and a human head. I believe that there is no face if you ask me. If you look closely to the picture in paragraph five it's clearly just a rock. NASA people are trying to proove there is a face is being shown. Trust me they are just trying to make a big theory.

Look at the article it says ""the face on mars has since become a pop icon"". It has starred in a hollywood film,appeared in books,magazines,radio talk shows and all. They want you all to make this formed rock popular they want you to make a big deal about it can't u see. There putting it on T.V,in movies,and on books its all for the money.

The face on the red planet ""Cydonia"" changed over time. If there was life on Cydonia the face wouldnt have changed like it did. In 1976 it looked like a shadow face. 1998 it had a white tent to it. 2001 it had racks like a rock. The face would had stayed the same if there was living life on it.

Another reason is it looks more like a trasformening rock. People tend to already had a picture of what soemthign is in there head. When the people that took the picture saw this thought it looked like a face. When you tell poeple what something looks like they wont fight you because in there head they seen it. The rock is just a time changing thing. 2001 it dosent even look like a fcae that they try and make you see.

On earth we have thing to prove that we live on here. On the red planet they only found this one thing. If there was life there would be more things to prove it and sooner. 1976 to 1998 is 22 years. In 22 years there has been only one ""face"" found. 1998 to 2001 is 3ish years. The same ""face was there but it was different. So 25 years has pasted on anf there has only been one thing the shows that there could be life on the red planet.

Now I under stand that it does look like a human face yes. And different people have went up there just to take picturse of it. But if there was life on this planet it dont you think it would have shown itself a little bit more and not hide for 25 years giving us one piece of evidence that its real.

If there was live on plante Cydonia it would had been more things to prove it. Also The face didn't stay the same. Another reason is a rock is more believibale then aliens. Just something to think about is they did think there was life on a different planet but earth dont you think they would tell people and not try and hide it for as long as they can. They would want the world to know more about it.",3,1,0.8460906744003296

The scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. That thanks to the shadows made it look like a face. And mesas are known to be quite common enough around Cydonia which is how they figured that out.

So a few days later NASA unveiled the image so everyone could see it. The authors reasoned that it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

First, the face is just a landform because a shadow coulod have appeared and make the rock look like it has a face. In paragraph 2 it say only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. This indicates that the shadow on the rock can make unusual apperance. Also in paragraph 2 it says Scientist figured it was just another Matian mesa, common enough around Cyndonia. This also indicates that things like this are usually happening.

Next, the face is just a landform because scientist have no proof that aliens excist. If aliens doesn't excist then aliens couldn't have mad the face on mars. In paragraph 6 it says few scientist believed that the face was alien articraft. Indicating that aliens are not proven to be real.

The face is really just an illusion. It is just a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that, ironically, make it look like a face. We only released it to the public to get an attraction to Mars. The program didn't mean for all these conspiracies. All we wanted was some publicity for mars.

We even took another, better picture to prove it. I know not all people believe us that it isn't an alien monument. If you look at the picture though, it is clearly a natural landform. The picture was ten times sharper than the original. Still you doubt are findings about the landform.

Again, I think whole-heartedly that it is natural. You can believe what you think it is. We don't even know of life on Mars, how can aliens make it if none are even there. You can be a fool and think that it is a alien monument, but the pictures show it. It is nothing but a perfectly natural monument on the possibly populated Mars.

You may never believe me unless you go there and see it yourself. Personally it easily shows to be a natural landform. Many believe to this day that aliens made that structure and that it is impossible to have a natural sturctue of that likeness.

7bb751c,"In the year of 1976, an object was discovered that looked like a human face on the planet Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars and taking pictures of possible places for Viking 2 to land. This 'human head' as they call it stretched two miles from each end of Mars. The passage states, ""It seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia."" NASA believed that there must have been a degree suprise among the mission controlers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when this 'Face' appeared on their monitor screens.

Days after this what seemed to be 'human face' was released for all to see. The authors say, ""It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" It did! NASA decided to call it ""Face on Mars."" This 'Face' became a popular icon throughout the world. The text states, ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" This object on Mars lead people to think that maybe there really was life on Mars.

When the MGS arrived at the Red Planet in September of 1997, 18 years after the Viking missions ended photogrpahing, Cydonia was still a big priority for NASA. Chief scientist, Jim Garvin says, ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim believed it was important to taxpayers. One year later on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time takig a picture that was ten times sharper and more clear than the photos taken by Viking. Thousands of people were waiting for the picture of the Face to appear on their monitor screens any minute.

Not everyone was satisfied with the picture of the Face that was taken that day. The author states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" The mission controllers were prepared to look again and noted, ""It's not easy to target Cyndonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work."" NASA does not pass over the Face very often, in fact, they scan the planet in 2.5 narrow strips.

On April 8, 2001, MGS drew close enough for a second look at the Face. Jim Garvin states, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West. The passage states, ""You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" If there were any objects in the picture taken of the Face in 2001 like an airplane or the ground or a house or pyramid, you could definitely be able to see them!

The Face found on the planet Mars is an extraordinary icon that will always be popular. Few believe that the Face could have been an alien artifact. The picture that was released for all to see noted, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Could there really be life on Mars? It is possible. ",1,1,0.7767912745475769
7bc14b3,"Imagine if you are on an spacecraft, and you see something unusual. It looks like a face on the surface of the planet Mars. Your first instinct might be that it was made by aliens or creatures we have never seen. Well, this did happen; in 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was flying over Mars and they stumbled upon what looked like a humans face, but they were not positive what or why it was there. This Face is just a natural landform because scientists proved it, there was no sign of abnormal activities, and mesas are not unusual in Mars.

This Face is a natural landform because scientists proved it was not made by aliens. The author states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonai for the first time Micheal Malin and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows how the Face was only a landform. ""The text states, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view' said Garvin. 'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each Pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This exemplifies how scientists used advanced technology to take an accurate picture of the Face. What they found was that it was a mesa.

Again this shows how scientists took advanced pictures and all they saw was a natural landform.

Furthermore, there was not any abnormal activity to prove it was aliens. Gavin said, ""As a rule of thumb you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This shows how the camera was powerful enough to have shown if it was really an alien monument. Similarly, Gavin states, ""So, if there were objects on this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This adds on to the idea that if there had been an alien civilization they would have been able to capture anything that was out of the normal.

Additionally, these landforms are not unusual on Mars. Infact, there are similar landforms on planet Earth. The article states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" This shows how mesas are common in Mars, and they are not strange to be seen. Furthermore, the text states, ""What the picture shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolate mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" This exemplifies how these landforms are not just in Mars, but also on planet Earth. However, this specific landform had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh, but the picture tooken byThe Mars Global Surveyor proves that it was a natural landform. This camera took a picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Clearly, the Face on Mars was just a mesa. There was no explanation found of how it could have been formed by aliens. First, there was no evidence found that it was an alien artifact; cameras proved that it was a landform. Plus, mesas are not unusual in the planet Mars. The Face seen on the Mars was another one of Mother Nature's ability to create spectacular scenes in the landscape. ",5,1,0.9084197282791138

Imagine if you saw a face on another planet what would you think? NASA saw one and thought it was a mesa others thought otherwise. I think it is a mesa on the red planet.

In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of formations on mars. The picture looked like a face so the people of the world thought oh my god. Aliens invaded mars and they will invade us run! But NASA kept saying other wise.

But two decades later (give or take two years) another picture was taken and to more and more people thought it was a face. No matter NASA tried to say it was rock formations but no one lisitened. No one lisitened to NASA because the conspirasicy theorisits of the world were feeding the fire way too much.

Then three years later

NASA relased another picture of the ""face"" but captioned ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth"". Now no one thought anything of the ""face"" everyone but the consipary theorists said it was a cover story but science won the day.

But i think it is just a mesa formed by astroids. If this keeps happening every time NASA relases a picture i think were in trouble. Well you herd my thoughts what are your thoughts.   ",3,1,0.8629456162452698

As a scientist from NASA I know for sure it is definitely not. NASA went into further detail with this ""Face"". We looked further into the face just to show people that this is not a face created by aliens.

Further more we found it was just another Martian mesa, common in Cydonia. Since the face was becoming popular, being in movies, magazines, radio shows, and books we had to prove that we are right. As a result in 2001 NASA took a even closer and more clear picture of this face on Cydonia. It showed that it was just illusions making the mesa look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Making this mesa look like a face. This revealed to all people that this face is just a natural landform.

In conclusion NASA knows more than just typical average day people. NASA has proved us wrong from thinking it is a face created by aliens. This is just an illusional face as I would say. As a scientist I do wish that there is alien life on Mars, but as far as we know there is none.

The position of the planet can also be the reason why the rock looks like a face. In paragraph 2, it says that the rock did have shadoes that could give anillusion of eyes, mouth, and a nose. In paragraph 8, It gives the season which caused clouds. Clouds are one of many reasons that causes shadows. These clouds could of ben in a cerrtain position that gave ""The Face"" illusions.

A possible explanation that the face is just a natural landform is erosion. In paragraph 8, it states that . Mars experienced a vey cloudy time. As known that clouds can form rain and/or wind which can be used to wither ddown rocks. Wind on Mars could be harsh and putting a lot of pressure aganst a giant rock causeing it to make indents. These indents can be seen as eyes, mouth, or even a nose.

As you see in the pictures that were taken by Viking 1, over the time period the face began to dissapear. In the pre-story,

""The Face"" was hand made by an alien then wouldn't you think that they would keep itin good condition . Instead ""The Face""

deformed over the time. Just like on earth, rocks break down over time.

There are many factors that can be said to prove that ""The Face"" is just a natural landform.

Cydonia, or Red Planet, revealed unusal shawdows which made the Face look like an Egyptian Pharaoah. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. After released on the JPL web site, the photo revealed a natural landform. Later in 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took another trip to Cydonia on a cloudless summer day. They snapped an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum pixel use. The picture later revealed a Martian equivalent of a butte.

7c28fb0,"The Face on Mars is just a natural mesa or buttle on mars. It was not made by Aliens or anything else, although it may seem in likeness to a human face. I know for a fact that the mesa is not a martian carving, it is too much like a mesa. The first image of it cannot be trusted, the linses are ancient compared to today's photography lenses. Although you would like to belive in the mesa, it is not clear enough to be seen in the lenses as what it really is and all that makes it look like a face are two holes and two hills.

The lense from the satelite that tooks the first picture was foggy and unable to clearly make out the complete image in great detail, as someone without their glasses could easily mistake another animal for their pet. They then got new, beter quality lenses and could make out the image better. They saw the mesa for what it was, a natural rock formation, weathered by time. It was an easy mistake for the old camera, along with the distance to make the mesa out wrong. The new technology was able to provide a much clearer image of the mesa and that it was not a face.

You may say that NASA faked the photo, hiding life on mars, though they have no reason to hide it. They could only benifit from a discovery such as life on another planet. It may even be found habitable to humans, given some time and oxygen. We may gain our own technology advancement through trade with the other race. NASA has no reason to hide the existance of aliens or to fake the photo, they would gain nothing.

Erosion has done much to help the mesa look as it does now, shaping the land to its liking. It could have easily made the hills and caves on the mesa, also, the sun cauld have been at just the right angle, shadowing the caves. Erosion is a long process and is always going on. The face is just a happening of erosion. That is probably how the facr formed.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is little more than erosion, sunlight's shadows and a bad camera. That is all it is and can be, NASA would have no reason to hide it as anything else. The conspiracy theories are just mad beliefs of crazy people who think the world is against them. The discovery of a new race would be quite amazing, though.

If there is ever life on Mars im sure the public would know by now. We all know once something weird or mythical happens the public is quick to find out.

On May 24 2001, a NASA spacecraft discovered a shadow in the shape of a human face. Some scientist believed that the face was caused by aliens, but many others believed that it was just a natural landform. Mesa's and butte's are two types of natural landforms. They are very common around Cydonia.

Around May, NASA put the image on the interenet for everyone to view. The caption of the picture said it was a huge rock with the ILLUSION of a face. An illusion is a when someone plays a trick on your eyes,this means it could look like a face but be an mesa. The way a person sees something is based on their own perspective. If one scientist sees a alien shape,another person sees a human face,and the other see a rock it is based on their point of view.

The picture caught alot of attention even by the chief scientist of NASA""s Mars Exploration Program,Jim Gavin. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team came to take pictures of Mars. The used a camera that had better quality than the Viking spacecraft. MOC's picture proved that the Face was only a natural landform. There were people who still thought it was analien so they took another picture. They used a camera that would make the image 3 times its pixel size, this means that if their was anything or size you would see is.

In the end,pictures proved that the Face shaped like a human's turned out to be just a butte or a mesa which was common. Many people are disappointed, but scientist have proven thier theory of ancient civilization on the Red Planet is incorrect. The Face still remains on the planet Mars. There are still many parts of the world that are yet to be discovered. Who knows what is out there?",3,1,0.8535985350608826
7ca5e5f,"So you think that aliens created the face that is on Mars? That is funny, there hasn't been any sign of aliens found yet anywhere. The shape made is most likely a cowensidence. It is also made up from shadows that are on the planet.

If you look in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it will tell some of the facts that are givin in the paragraph above. My team at NASA were deffinitly in shock,we had thought that it looked like a egytion head. We observed it for a minit and then laughed it off. But like I said before it is an elosion and it was just shadows that were on the planet. I am guessing that some of the featers are also from craters on the planet.

Im going to take a shot in the dark and say that you most likely thought it was from aleins becuase you have seen it on TV and you have to beleave every thing on Telivision. Well what about this,the weather man said it was supposed to be rainy out side and was going to have a temperture of 45 degrees,well it is bright out side and 70 degrees. Are you seing my point now? The movie you might see might have something that seems to be very full of facts and might seem real but anyone can do that but still lie.

Some people said Neal Armstrong was fake and a set up on Telivisoin,just for show you might say. But we have evidence ulike you. We have photo graphs and things that came off of the planet. Don't you dare try to argue with someone that knows what they are talking about and has worked in this kind of inviroment. You might not beleave it but you have to learn things from the past that happened at the station and things that have been descovered,so that you don't think that you found something new but in reality you are trying to do reaserch on something from long ago. Now tell me again why you think a fictional character would have made a face on a planet. Ohh yes thats wright becuase you can sit on a coach and beleave some shiny screen tryed telling you. Now does that mean you really think you think something like Big foot also egsist. Does that mean that you saw that movie Planet of the Apes and thought that there might be a planet that apes rule a world and have humans work for them.

There was no evidence left on that planet to show ailens where ever there or left the figure we saw. We have natrual land forms and that reminds us of mulitple things. So there is a possibilty that what we saw use to be a old volcaneo or somthing else.

Details that we took from the multiple photos we took don't match or even look like the first photo. All the othere photos we took was better quality than the first and none of them look like the original. So there is a chance that the camera caught somthing that with the unusual shadows was a once in a life time photo.

So what you are saying just doesn't match up with the fact and evidence we have on file. Thats why we beleive it wasnt left by ailens.         ",3,1,0.6386097073554993
7cd2bae,"I believe that the face is just a natural landform. I know this because people discovered or proven if or if not there is life on Mars. People always talk about martians, but never really find them.

Mars has peculiar weather conditions. They have dust storms. They dust gets whipped by wind. Mars also gets hit by meoters and rarely, astroids. An astroid hit Mars hard enough that a piece of it flew to the Earth. When Mars gets hit, it forms craters on the surface and can go deep into the ground. The wind could have possibly pushed dust into a crater and formed the face.

Also, NASA sends different space crafts and structure to take a look at Mars. Usually the crafts land on 3 or more legs. The craft could have possibly marked a dust mound. Wind three or more legs, you could form the face on Mars' surface.

What NASA needs to do is send more crafts and robots. I think they should do that to get mor eevidence then just taking some pictures. THe robots can do things that a human would. The robot can feel the face and dig to see what is under it. Yes, it would ruin the face but we would get evidence and details if we try.

In conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. We to strive to find evidence on why it is there and why it formed. Maybe there is Life on Mars. The world may never know.      ",2,1,0.8405563235282898

However, some people think that this could be an actule human life form on Mars, But, When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, they saw that it was just a natural land form.

7cfefa0,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landfrom. It was not created by aliens or other forms of life because there is no proof that it was but there is evidence that proves it is just a mesa or butte.

In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling mars when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. It was about two miles from end to end. It seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on mars. But scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa. They were common in that area on mars, but it had an unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

A few days later NASA unreveiled the image for all to see. The headline said that it was a ""huge rock formaiton, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth"". The authors thought it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It did.

After that the ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. It even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

But some people think that NASA was hiding it as being bona fide evidence of life on Mars. But NASA defenders said ""they wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars"". Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Mars became a priority for NASA.

So on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Mars for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. But not everyone was satisfied. The picture of the face was taken when it was a cloudy time of year on Mars, but some skeptics believed that the aliens were trying to hide the Face by using haze.

After that in 2001 NASA took another picture of the face with 3 times the pixel size, so if there was anything the martians used to build it you could see it. What the picture actually shows was a Martian equivelant of a butte or mesa.        ",2,1,0.8572492599487305

Many people say that we are not alone in this universe. Some people say diffrent planets have secret life forms on it. But, i dont think believe that a face on Mars was created by another life form beside humans. There has been theries for centurys about space, that we are not alone and people from diffrent planets exsist. I dont think so because it there were other life forms out there why havent they made contact.

Space is full of adventure, discovery, and wonder but to come to the realization that there are other life form beside or own. It would change how people think and would change reality forever. They put aliens on movies and telivision for entertainment only not to be taken into content. The face on Mars is just a creation of all the space debry and the astroieds that hit Mars and have sculpted in to resembling a human figure or ( human face).

The face on Mars maybe could have been there for a long time before but, we just didnt descover it till now. People dont know how large space really is. They just know what people till them or what they have discovered, but why would aliens really exsist? Some people say there is life on all planest and we are not looking hard enough.

Even if there were life on diffrent planents why would we just be hearing about it now and not sooner. What the picture actually showa is the Martian equivqlent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. The people of America and of this great nation dont need to be consirned about if we can defend then aginst an extra terresteral attack. Also, we dont know what knid of weapons they have or if they have powers or anything about them. We don't know there weeknesses or strenths. So, we would be litterally out numbers a maybe out-smarted and maybe out-guned and we might lose that fight to defend the world and out home.

Some people believe in aliens and that the Face was made by alliens ,because after NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see it caught the attention of people everywhere. The ""Face on Mars"" became known everywhere. It became featured in Hollywood flims, appeared in books, magazines, and even haunted grocery store check out lines. Who wouldn't believe the Hollywood flims and books? Everyone beliveved and some still believe the films and books. Be carful what you believe. Sometimes it's not true like the aliens.

On April 8, 2001 MGS (Mars Global Surveyor) drew close enough for a second look at the Face and mars. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center of the Face. Malin's team got really good pictures using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. In 2001 each pixel had to be span 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in 1976.

Some people were going over the photos and if there was any kind of objects or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks. You could see it. There is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face.

7d6ac01,"""The Face"" Is Not A Face

The 1998 dicovery of, the Face has gotten its fair share of publicity throughout numerous years. This photo that was taken on NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, as it was searching for possible landing sites. This ""face"" is nothing but a natural landfrom that happens to look like a face. There are many persuasive and factual reasons to back up the fact that there has been no alien formation on Mars.

First, there has been no real, hard evidence that this human-like figure is actually a face. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" even says,""it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" (Notice, it said likeness.) Just because one article and a Hollywood movie says that this was alien created, doesn't mean it really was.

Also, any natural landforms can look like something it is not. Have you ever looked at a rock or even a cloud and said, ""Wow, that looks like a [insert object or name]!"" There have been plenty of instances in which something has been mistaken to be someting it is not. For example, The Little Dipper, as we call it, is said to look like a spoon. Does that mean that there is a big, shiny spoon in the sky? Of couse not, so why should we say the same about a formation of rocks on Mars that happen to look like a face.

Lastly, NASA has even confirmed that this is just a natural rock formation. I know this because, NASA unveiled an image of this ""face"" and captioned it, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth."" So, this rock's shadows have given the illusion of a human-like face, which leads to the assumption that there is no real face.

You might be thinking,"" Well, why did the people who discovered this even release the information if it wasn't comepletely factual."" This is beacuse of the conspiracy theorists. Think about it , if you would have never heard about this Face on Earth in books, magazines, and radio talk shows, would you have believed it? NASA is a very trustworthy and credible association and if information wasn't released until it was proven true than none of this would have happened.

In conlusion, the Face on Earth is nothing but a myth, until there are reliable discoveries that have declared it real. Since there is no evidence that there has been alien formation on Earth, it is just a hoax. I hope I have given a sufficent amount of reasons to argue that the Face is not a face.

I predicted that it must have a degree of surpise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion lab when the face appeared on the monitiors.

Some other scientist belived the face was an alien artfact. I snapped a picture ten times sharper than the oraginal Viking photos. I have done lots of reaserch, and revealed a natural landform. I reasched the photo a lot more. After a lot of rearch, I decoved that there was no alien monument after all.

We decieded that we still did not have enough evedience. Perhaps, alien markings were hidden by haze. Still there is no evedience as we continued. After more and more reasch. There is still no alien monument.

We decovered that the picture is acually the Martian of a butte or mesa. They are landforms common around the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about that same height as the face on mars. In the end, there was not evedience of alien lifeform or artcraft.

""OTHER_PII i'm telling you they hid something from you, the public, and me, too. You may be more like mom with all the brains and being a NASA scientist and all that, but I take after dad and have it within in me to look deeper than the facade the government has put up.

First of all if aliens did create it w ewould have seen some in the picture/s, secondly there just isn't any/enough evidence to prove the accuisation, and lastly we, as NASA have plenty of evidence that this was not created by such cretures.

First of all there is not way that this face was created by living creatures. If they did we would have evidence like seeing forms of some type of homes or just the creatures themselves should have shown up but indeed none did.

Like in the passage ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it includes ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" But in fact there was nothing like this noticable in the close up photograph. The text also includes ""that it was a natural land form. No monument at all.""

Secondly, people with these conspiracys have little to no evidence that there could be any living life on face/mars. They wouldn't stop with their theories so NASA took it into consideration and went out there again, even though it is beyond hard to find it.

But it was on a sunny day. Still, there was no sign of living creatures nor aliens. However In the passage it states ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" Which I could see why some people would believe that NASA would want to hide amazing information like that. They could think that the people of Earth are not ready to quite that out yet. Then again thats just a bunch of non-sense. If scientist did find another place where living creatures could live, that would be a big discovery. Too big to even hide.

Lastly NASA has a lot more evidence to prove that it is jsut a natural landform other than a hidden alien planet. Like one thing from the article is ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illision of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors believed it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Also the author includes ""Scientist figured it was just another Matian mesa, common enough around Cydona, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptain Pharaoh."" So there is much more evidence to comply with NASAs theroies than the conspiracys.

In conclusion its pretty obvious that this is just a natural formation made to just look like a human face. The evidence makes it a clear choice. So this ""face"" is just a landform and we all have to come together and learn how to accepted what it gives us because no matter what its not like we can change it.    ",4,1,0.8907033205032349

Look, as someone who's been a scientist for my whole life, and only researching on Mars features, I think I would know if there were any aliens on Mars. There have been a few signs of volcanic activity, and volcanoes on earth have formed something the exact same height. So I believe that a random volcanic activity is what has caused this Martian Mesa.

Besides, on April 8, 2001, it was proven by other scientists besides me that said it was a mesa, and there is on in in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa abount the same height as the face on Mars.

So if you really think that there is aliens on mars that created that then you are just absolutely crazy.

The reality is that we don't know if there are really aleins, we just have faith in the unknown.

The people that believe aliens exist had a feild day over the recent discovery by NASA in 1976-2001 by the Viking 1. The viking 1 found an astonishing rock form that took the shape of a humans face. the first thing most people said was, ""There is alein life on mars!"" These people could be right, we have been serching for dozens of years for other life foarms, and its the perfect time to find a breakthrough in science and in astronomy.

To others the belief of the face, found on mars, made by an alein is a hoax. It is just a story for the public to stay entertained. The face on the surface of mars is just a rock and it is made by natural movement under and on the surface of mars and not by a life form such as an alien. In the article"" Unmasking the Face on Mars"" the author says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The face in mars brings apn no new information to astronomy because there has not yet been any proof of any life on mars.

The faith we have in this ""mission"" is more faith than we have had regarding new creatures in the deapths of the sea.

There are manyh possibilitys on how landforms made the face such as the hardening of lava, tectonic plates, astroids or other rocks that entered Marses atmosphere,or it could have been made by the rotaion of mars .

Over all the idea of aleins makes a good hollywood movie, but it doesn't make a good reality. As Mr. Garvin says, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars.""

7e09846,"The Face: Alien Artifact or Natural Landmark

Do you think that the "" Face on Mars"" is an alien artifact or is just a natural landform on Mars? Well, in my own personal opinion I believe that it is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, and took 10 pictures to get the perfet shot. I also believe this because, landforms are common around the American West. Although, some my think the picture is an alien artifact, it is not because NASA went back to Mars with an even better camera and, took even more pictures of the Face.

First of all, I believe that the Face is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, from their 1976 expidition, to see if the conspericy theories were correct, and they weren't. In the passage it says,"" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origninal Viking photos."" It also says,""

the image first appeared on a JPL wed site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I used these sentences because, they prove that NASA is corret, there wasn't any alien activity.

I believe that the Face of Mars is an natural landform because, landforms are common around the American West. The passage says,"" What picture actually shows is the Martian equivialent ofa butte or mesa- landforms are acually common around the American West."" I used thi sentence because, it shows that the landform wasn't a once-in-a-life-time sort of thing, you see them quite offten actutally. That is also something that people who don't believe NASA never take under consideration.

Some people may believe that the Face is an alien artifact, but in all truthfulness it is a natural landform. I say this because, in 2001 NASA got some amazing cameras to take the best pictures that they could possibly take to prove themselves right. In the passage it says,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" I used this because, it proves that NASA has worked really hard to get high quality photos of the Face.

In conclusion, I believe the Face is nothing more that a natrual landmark on Mars because, NASA went to Mars to get more pictures, after their mission in 1976, in 1998. I also belive this because, landforms are common in the American West area. Although, some may believe that the Face is an alien artifact it is not because NASA got high qualiy photos to prove it 2001. What do you think the Face is?    ",4,1,0.8696450591087341

My reasons for believing that is because there is no proof of aliens on Mars, there is no possible way that a human built because the only thing that has gotten to Mars is a bunch of probes, and even if we did have a human on Mars we wouldn't have the equipment to build something like that. There are no signs of alien life so how can it be made by aliens ?

The face on Mars is a natural landform. In the article it says JPL web site said that it was a natural landform. That means there is no possible chance that it was built by aliens. I think the reason why the radio, Hollywood, magazines, and TV said all that stuff was so that they could attention. People in the world for some reason are drawn to all that. They are drawn to the idea that there is a possible chance that we aren't the only ones out here in universe. The people that did all of that most likey just wanted attention, so that can they get more views or followers.

An ancient civilization on Mars just wouldn't make any sense. We had ancient civilizations too, but we didn't bulid every single butte in America. Natural landforms are so interesting that people just immediately think who made it and how it got there. There is no possible way that an ancient group of anything made that because there is not enough advanced technology. Even if aliens did exist and they did have technology why would they waste there time on building a face on Mars ?

If you are saying that it's not natural then thats like saying that the Middle Butte and Snake River where made by aliens. Just think for actual second about how that makes no sense because I don't go outside and see aliens trying to build a landform. Even if aliens did make it then how come they aren't still around or left any clues behind? Did they just all of the sudden build an amazing landform and just leave? No they didn't because if you put your hard work into something you are going to stay with it as long as you can and see how it ends up later in life. If there was aliens they would've left something so that we would know it was them.

The Face on Mars was not made by aliens. It says in the article that it is a natural landform. I don't believe everything that scientist say but I believe this one because it makes sense. All the proof you need is in the article and I added some things such as, how we can't find any aliens, how there are no signs of them now or even in the past, and that if they are real they wouldn't have that type of technology.

Now i will be talking about face one. this face is there in 1976. To my personal vision the face is still sorte of developing, or the picture is really blury. Although it's developing or blury you can still seea face. NASA claim's for it to look or be visualized as a viking. These face's do look like natural landforf's.

They look like wind or a storm formed them. In face one it look's like there is alot of wind when NASA took the picture. In face two it kinda revels a little more . What im thinking is there had to have been a storm or strong wind for face one to be so blury.

These face's seem as if they had alot of time to form. Can that mean there natural.

Think about this if these structure's were man made or alein made they wouldn't look like this so what is that telling us. Another reason is if it was man made it would be much smaller. These faces have to be natural landforms. Also to my understanding NASA has been watching the faces for a while.

Then in picture three it is just totaly blown over. It seem's as if wind just keept blowing over then time and time agian. If it was man made this would not have happend they would have kept it clean.

Many other Martian Mesas are in that area so it wouldnt be surprising if it was just another one. All though it would be enchanting to find out that there is life on Mars, the land mass is not enough evidence to support that theory that aliens or some sort of life built the face. Lets talk about the size of the face.

The face is too big to be a face of someone or something anyways. Unless there is a new species on Mars that is that big or maybe it is a ancient burial site like the ones that the egyptions made. The pictures would be able to see any life next to the face. They would be able to see if there were any shacks maybe house or aircrafts of some sort. Lets talk about what scientists think.

The Snake river Plain of Idaho is about the same size as the face and it reminds him of it. The face could have just been a couincadince. The face also could not have been. Small meteors could have crashed into the mesa to create the facial features of the face. In pictures of the face you can see a lot of different crates next to it. There a small craters and large craters. it wouldn't be surprising if it got hit by a crater.

This might just be me, but I'm almost positive that a landform like that couldn't have been made from making something like a face on the surface. I'm sure that as its grown over time, the hills make it look like a face. If some type of alien were to make that I dont think it could've turned into a mesa.

I know the Face used to be a lot clearer, and slowly turned into a mesa but I think it's just the way landform grew in. The face isn't very semetrical, so I'm sure that if it was aliens, they would've been more serious about this and tried to make it more semetrical. In the article, they say that 25 years ago, they were looking for a place for NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft to land. So, assuming that the spacecraft landed sometime later in the future, it never saw any aliens! If they had seen aliens, I think they would've said something, especially after 25 years.

I would say this situation is just like clouds. Sometimes you see clouds that might look like a dog or a whale, but you dont say anyone made those! You wouldn't assume it was an alien. I would say they are clouds that just happened to float by one another that formed into a dog or a whale, depending on what the cloud actually looks like. That's usually the case, a cloud could look like a big blob, but then float next to a different one and form into something unique. That happens naturally, just like the Face on Mars.

With all of the things I have said, I believe that my evidence and what I have pointed out will help other people know that the Face is just a landform. I'm not saying everyone that hears my ideas about this will automatically think its a landform now, but I do think that some of them will change their minds if they think it was made by any kind of living species. There are many landforms that were made just the way they are, even if it doesn't look like it. So, yes, the Face on Mars is just a landform, and hopefully everyone will soon know this!",3,1,0.8338150978088379
7f318e4,"Welcome my name is Bianca a scientist at NASA. Many of you may know about the strange ""Face on Mars,"" and how there are countless rumors about the famous being a natural landform or bona fide evidence of life on Mars. While scientists belive and have configured it is in fact a natural landform skeptics just do not agree.

However, May 24, 2001 when the photo was snapped scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, since it was common around Cydonia. Just this peticular one had unusual shadows that make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. When NASA uneiled the image the caption noted ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving illusion of facial features."" They said or reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. In fact it did!

Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists are just glued to the fact that they think the Face is evidence to life on Mars. They say its evidence that NASA would rather hide than show, but reality is us as NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars!

Although, few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact conspiracy theorists were driven to prove it was evidence of life. And so on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his MOC or Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When the image first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed...a natural landform. Proving there was no alien monument.

After all, skeptics were still drilled to the idea that it is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorists said perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze. So our NASA team on April 8, 2001 the global surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo!

Finally, after all photos were taken and examined the 2001 pictured demonstrated that what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Much like most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. So after all the Face on Mars was acutally just a natural landform. All rumors have cleared the air. Scientists have configured!",4,1,0.884150505065918
7f3c6dd,"The Face is a natural landform. First, aliens aren't real. Second, they don't even have that type of machinery to do it. The Face was infact created by natural occurances and it appeared because of a natural disaster. Therefore aliens did not create the Face.

Aliens aren't real. We have seen them on television shows and movies, but they are fake. When we talk about there could be life on Mars, that doesn't mean that it is an alien, we just don't know what it is.Why would aliens even create a big landform of no use, it just doesn't make any sense. An alien definately didn't create that lanform.

Next, the aliens would have had to use machinery inorder to shape it, which they don't have. The aliens would have to have something like a drill inorder to shape it how they want to. It is just like here on earth. Unless the aliens stole our machinery, or they are really strong and they can carve it with their hand or a shovel or something, then aliens definately didn't make the landform.

In 1976, the picture looked unclear and blurry, but it looked like a face. Then in 1998, It looked less like a face, and it was still blurry. Finally in 2001, we found out that it has no characteristics of a face. The explanation for that is that either the pixels weren't sharp enough to see it clearly. Or it is because it was cloudy and foggy.

Another reason that we could have thought that is a face is because their spaceships weren't as advanced as ours now and they couldn't see the landform from that far away and with how foggy it was, like the article said in paragraph 8. We have more advanced technology and we were capable of seeing the real truth about the landform. We have more technology inorder to get clearer picture than back then and in 2001 it was cloudless, like the article states in paragraph 10. Our technology is more advanced that we were able to discover the truth.

Also, aliens couldn't have created it because the article states that if there were any other objects in the picture, and that you would have been able to see them if they were there. If there aren't like any houses or transportation there, then how would the alien survive? Exactly, they wouldn't. So aliens infact couldn't have made the landform.

You might try to say that we didn't create it, so it would have to be them. Well you are correct. We didn't create it, but it is just like what we have here on earth. We have hurricane, tornadoes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions. Maybe a natural disaster like that happened there. We may not have created it, but that doesn't mean that something like a natural disaster couldn't havecreates it.

From natural disasters to blurry and unclear pictures. This all can explain a lot of things. Like the fact that aliens aren't real and maybe eroding happened and that was the only place that didn't erode so it was rose up and shaped like that. Or that natural disasters can occur from time to time. Just remember, when you are sitting on your couch and a story comes on about this, aliens didn't do it, a natural disaster did.

7f3ff0a,"There are many facts that lead me to believe why the ""Face on Mars"" is not an alien artifact and just a landform. There are many obvious facts that prove scientists at NASA right. According to the text, the face was found in an area where there are many landmasses, such as mesas. This led scientists to believe that the so called ""alien artifact"" is just another mesa, because of how common they are.

Another fact that led me to believe this, is that NASA would have no reason to lie to the public. If NASA had wanted to hide the fact that there are aliens, they wouldn't have released the photograph in the first place. NASA was made so that we could know more about space, why would they keep something important like aliens from us? NASA would actually benefit from having an ancient alien civilization on Mars.

According to the text, the first picture of the ""Face on Mars"" didn't have very good quality. Though most scientists didn't believe that it was some sort of artifact, many were curious. They took another picture, with better quality and released it to the public.

As they had suspected it was just another mesa, but of course, some people will always have doubts, even if the facts lead directly to the correct answer. These are some of the reasons why I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is not an alien artifact, but a landform that coincidentally resembles a human face.       ",2,1,0.8350304365158081
7f840dc,"'Umasking the face on mars' well at NASA we are discussing the face with someone wo thinks it was created by aliens. I would have to disagree to that. My arguement would be that it is just a natural landform.

Why do i say it is just a natural landform well because aliens arent real. Also in 1976 you could barely tell it would happen to look like a face way after 2001. If aleins would have created that then when they first created it then why did it not look like a face then? It's just a natural landform that was formed into a face.

In 1976 it just looks like lump on the ground and in 1998 you cant even see where the eyes nose and mouth would be and if they would of created it then surely they would of made it more noticeble. In 2001 it looks like a turtle shell , it has cracks in it and is shap almost like an oval but not excatly and i say an oval because there is no sharp edges. The reason i am explaining the shape and apperacance is because if someone were to creat a face it would take years to form out into one. Later on in the years it doesn look like a face but im gonna disagree on it wasnt created by aleins it is just a natrual landform.

That was my argument on aleins did not creat the face that it is just a natrual landform. It formed into looking like a face but didnt right when someone first saw it so there for how could any know it was suppose to be a face like i said. It just shaped into one over the years. Then people wanna make an opinion that is on aleins creating it. I think it is just a natural landform.",2,1,0.8433325290679932
7fb27b8,"The 'Face' on Mars is a natural landform, not an alien structure NASA is keeping a secret. Many of the top scientists at NASA wish it was an alien structure. There have been multiple photographs that show no hieroglyphics or signs of alien life. Some of the people on the mission said that it reminds them of landforms on earth. Mars' Face is just a natural landform.

Many of the top scientists at NASA wish it was an alien structure. NASA's funding for projects is dwendeling fast, an alien structure on Mars would be huge for them. Why would NASA lie if there really was life on Mars? They wanted the Face to be an alien form as much as everyone else did.

NASA wouldn't lie about there being life on Mars, if there was they would have funding.

There have been multiple photographs that show no hieroglyphics or signs of alien life. In 1967 the Viking 1 photographed the Face on Mars, 18 years after the mission it was photographed agian. In April of 1998 Jim Garvin photographed the face, ""a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" that photo revealed a natural landform. When the photo was asked to be retaken on a clear summer day, it again showed a natural landform. All the new photos point to the Mars' Face being a natural landform.

Some of the people on the mission said that it reminds them of landforms on earth. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program found that the Face on Mars was the equivilant of a butte or mesa on earth. Buttes or mesas are common around the American west. Garvin even said that ""It remeinds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" The team that Garvin led to take the picture in 2001 agree that it is a natural landform.

7fec7af,"Landform or face? Is everyones first question when they hear about the figure that looks like a face that was found on Mars in 1976. NASA has studied this topic and has come to the conclusion that it is simply landforms. Now the question is what kind of land forms and how did they form?

NASA has been studying this topic since 1976 to 2001. Team Nasa has been reshearching and studying picturers and has come to the conclusion that the face is a landform. We are highly certain it is a butte or Messa .A butte or Mesa is a lava dome. We compared the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it was the same hieght as the face on Mars. NASA has studied pictures that are so high tech that if there was small shacks on the planet you could see it! This reshearch has been fun for team NASA.

As part of the NASA team I can tell you we did thorogh research to be absolutly certain it was not created by aliens. If this were created by aliens it would be a big step for NASA and the world. I hope this information was helpful to you          ",2,1,0.7918015718460083
7ff1ac8,"Aliens may or may not be real, but if they were they could not make this. I know this is just a natural landform. Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.

First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.

The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.

The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West."" Then to prove it even more it says this. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar."" So that just said that these ""faces"" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.

These are my 3 reasons on why i think it is impossible that aliens made it. It's just a natural form. I am not saying aliens are not real but i am saying that they did not make this face without us seeing it.              ",3,1,0.8562679290771484
7ff619f,"The Face is a natural landform,it is not something that was created by aliens. Aliens don't exsist so how could it have been from an alien. Mission controllers said that it is not easy to target Cydonia,it is hard work. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is landforms common around the American West. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform because it is hard to find,it actually shows the Martin equivalent of a mesa,and aliens don't exsist.

The Face is a natural landform. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,so if there were objects in the picture you could see what they were. Each pixel in the 2001 image spamsa 1.56meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. It also says in the passage that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Some people believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. Thats when mission ccontrollers decided to look again, and thats when they said, ""Its not easy to target Cydonia, it is a lot of hard work"".

With all this data that has been revealed people should think that its just a natural landform. If there was aliens that did this their markings would be other places besides just here. Even though some people aren't satisfied with this more things in the future can happen to make them believe this. Maybe if more pictures are taken then peoples thought of view with change.

7ffc1a6,"Why would you think the Face was created by aliens? When photographers take pictures of Mars, you never see an alien in the photos. There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens. Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform.

First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it. Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa. They are common for the area that the Face was found in. Why do research if scientists know it is only a mesa? Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting. No one has ever seen an alien, so if NASA released pictures they would get loads of publicity. NASA isn't going to let people lose interest in their foundation, therefore they aren't going to lie to people.

Next, we have the information that tells us the Face is just a landform. When new pictures of the Face were revealed in 1998, the truth came out. Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument.

Of course, people still weren't satisfied. Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution. The new resolution helped capture the real size of the Face. After extensively studying the pictures, Jim Garvin states that it ""is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"". He goes on to say these types of landforms are common on Earth, mainly in the American West. The Face is just a regular landform.

In conclusion, that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Almost 30 years of research went by until they came to their conclusion. The Face is only a meer mesa. It was created naturally, and not by aliens. No one can argue with facts!",4,1,0.8610898852348328
8011911,"In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the ""Face on Mars"". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.

When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that ""the Face"" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that ""the Face"" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.

Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture ""huge rock formation..."" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of ""the Face"". The articles states the the image was ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"". This image proved that ""the Face"" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.

So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph ""on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"". It also says ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West"". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.

The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that ""the Face"" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars. Who knows?",4,1,0.8925029039382935

The so called ""Face of Mars"" is believed to be something made by aliens by many people. Some people think this because it looks like a face. When actually it is just natural landform common around the American West (paragraph 12).

First, I can see why some people believe that the landform is something made by aliens because it is something non common. And never-to-be seen before, something so cool and unimagineable because it looks like it has a face on it. And that some times people just want to believe that there's new and unheard of in the world.

In paragraph 6 is also says, ""photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet..."" In doing so is shows that scientists provived evidence that the large thing was a natural landform.

In conclusion the ""Face of Mars"" was proven to be a natural landform, not an alien artifact. Yes, some people may still believe that it was something caused by aliens and thats their opinion.

80b1f21,"The so-called ""Face on Mars"" is not what its famous title implies. If it's name was to be re-done to be politically correct, it would be renamed ""The Mesa on Mars."" The landform would be renamed that because it is a mesa, if there was life on Mars we'd know, and because the only reason we ever called it a face was because of poor camera quality in 1976.

In many Western countries, there are landforms called Mesas. They're quite amazing, and a few probably do look like faces up in space. But do people believe that aliens created them? Why, no! Mars is alike to Earth in ways, so it makes sense for it to have some of the same landforms that we do.

If there even was alien life on Mars, the public would know about it. Just like they found out about the ""the Face on Mars"". It would get NASA publicity and money, so they'd tell the world about their findings. So if the face really was created by aliens, NASA would tell us. But they know its not, so they won't tell us otherwise.

At first in 1976, the mesa did look like a face. Most of that is due to the shadows that were cast at the time and the quality of the camera. It wasn't the best. But, cameras kept evolving and NASA eventually went back in for better pictures. Once they did, though, it did not resemble a face as much.

In conclusion, ""the Face on Mars"" is actually a mesa. Science and good camera quality has proved it. And if that's not convincing enough, it is a mesa just like we have in the U.S.,

NASA would be the first to let anyone know if there was life on Mars, and because it only ever looked like a face due to bad camera quality. Now, there is not as much mystery to ""the Face on Mars"", and it may not be as much as an adventure, but NASA

It resembles the butte or mesa landforms in the American West. They are naturally formed in nature. As my colleague said in his text they resemble eachother enormously. Also, we used the absolute maximum resolution in the latest picture we took in 2001. It was made very apparent that this was not aliens at work but again just a natural landform. The only reason that people aren't believing the truth with our technology is because these conspiracy theorists. Finally, the biggest piece of evidence that the face is a natural landform is that if NASA discovered this, we would benefit tremendously. We are not hiding this from anyone. We here at NASA would get more money, funding, and attention. We mainly would want the funding to perhaps interact with the aliens if they were there, but they are not. So that is why I, a scientist at NASA, can confirm that the picture from 1976 is just a bad picture of a natural landform. Also, I can confirm that we here at NASA aren't hiding the truth from you. If there is ever aliens we will make sure to tell you, the people, first.      ",3,1,0.8264665603637695

There are many reason to why the face is just a logical thing that can happen. It could've been buttes or mesa landforms that are located in the American West. Also, there is no reason NASA would have for trying to hide something so major from the world. Lastly, if their was aliens on mars, wouldn't their be more evidence supporting the aliens instead of nothing?

Garvin from Mars Global Surveyor, talks about how it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho as stated in paragraph 12. Anyone could go to Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho and see for themselves if they look alike. A simple way to put it is that their are so many things this ""face"" could've been other than aliens. Which is why most people don't believe in this ""theory"" because it is far from practical.

Although NASA could hide what they saw at Mars, why would they? There is no reason for NASA to keep anything they discover a secret, or try and hide anything from us. NASA wouldn't have even shared the photo if they felt that they didn't want for anyone to know, to stir up this controversy in the first place! The astronauts were most likely just as shocked as we were when they saw the image.

Lastly, there isn't enough evidence to infer that there is any type of life form on Mars. In paragraph 9 of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it talks about how it isn't easy to target where the face is. If the face was a form of life there would be more, and it probably wouldn't be so hard to find. Most likely there wouldn't be one face but many.

Even with every fact in the world there are still the great questions we all have from time to time. Even with the facts we all know about. Though I think that there is no possible way there could be any existence on Earth. You could always say ""what if."" Which is why I hope you take my words into accountance when you think about the face on mars.           ",4,1,0.8088958859443665
80ea52e,"You think that was an alien? It is a landform by one of the storms there, anything that fell there, or just the way the planet is. Ther is no such thing as an alien as we know. I believe that it was on of those three things.

First I think all of the planets that we know of has storms. The was probably a rock udder neith it. Then the red sand came on top of it to make a face. There is most likely tornadoes that are in that area as wall. Tornatoes do some pretty weird things and that could be one of them.

Next we have also sent rovers into space before to look for stuff. Maybe one of the rovers got hit and fell on mars. Then it got covered up in the sand when it crashed. That is the most likely possiblity but it could be some rocks as well. Also anything else that is on the planet as meterals of the the planet.

My lastly, I believe it could have been just the way the planets natural landform is. On earth there is a lot ofthing that are really weird that is from when we got her. That is just the way the landform is like. It will most likely stay that way in till something comes in and mess it up. I personal believe that is was the way it is because of the natural land form.

This what I think what made that face and not an alien. If you dont believe me then that is fine, but how do you it was an alien. I said that it was caused by bad whether, something that fell, or that is it natural land form.

80f3e2e,"The reason I, the scientist think and know that the face is just a natural landform is because, we have pictures of Mars and the ""face"" picture.

The first reason why my claim is true is because firstly, there is NO proof of life being on Mars of all the years it has existed and there could possibly be no life on that planet because there is NO way that there could be life on Mars, because of its condition. Mars is NOT fit for humans to live on or any other natural organism. I'm not just saying a that a human could live on the planet but, you wouldn't even last 5 seconds on Mars. In fact, Mars has volcanoes. Maybe its just a lava dome? Who knows? But what we do know is that there could possibly be no sign of any human or other organisms on planet Mars. On April 5, 1998, when the Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a pictures ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. And justin that picture, there was no proof of any supernatural life (alien) life or human monument on Mars.       ",2,1,0.8402777910232544
8131512,"I think this is a natural landform. I believe this because there is more evidence to support this idea. So in these next two-three paragraphs I am going to tell you why.

The first fact that clarify's that the face is just a landform comes in the last paragraph in the article. In this paragraph it clearly states that the picture actually shows a Martian equivlant of a butte or mesa - landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin.

Another paragraph that supports the evidence is clear and correct is in paragaph eleven. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This supports me evidence from the paragraph above by telling how much you could see in these pictures.

In these last few paragraphs I have given you evidence from the article that support that the Face is a natural landform. So I hope I persuaded you to believe that the Face is a natural Landform. ",2,1,0.829187273979187
815397d,"Do you think aliens are real? If not, good for you! If so, let me tell you how they aren't. I'm a scientist for NASA and I'm currently studying 3 figures on Mars that look kind of like faces. It all started twenty five years ago when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a shadowy figure of a human face.

When the images were shown to the other controllers they were surprised, of course. Unfortunately that surprise didn't last. The scientists just figured it was just a Martian mesa, except the shadows on it had made it look like an Egyption Pharroh. The image was released a few days later for everyone to see, the authors believed it was a great way to attract attention to Mars. That's exactly what it got, attention.

Although the ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon, it is believed by some that the face is evidence that there was once life on Mars. Which some claim it's evidence that we'd rather hide. I would like to dissagree with that statement though. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team had snapped a picture even better than the orginal pictures. When the pictures were surfaced on the internet, it appeared that the ""faces"" were just a site of natural landform.

Three years later after people still weren't satisfied, we decided to take another look. The pixels were better in the second picture, that even if there were aliens you'd be able to see them! Luckily the picture actually shows landforms common around the American West.",3,1,0.8718872666358948

Although the face on Cydonia may look like it was a human face, when the first picture of the face was taken, cameras were not advanced enough to see what it really was. Although you may say that NASA is trying to is trying to hide evidence of life on Cydonia , many other scientist also believe that the face was just another Martian mesa. Also the discovery of alien life would benefit NASA.

NASA unvieled the image of the face to the public for everyone to see. Face became a pop icon, It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in magazines, and on radio talk shows. Very few of the scientist believed that the face was an alien artifact, it

became a priority for NASA

when in 1997, Global Surveyor

MSG arrived on cydonia NASA said they would photograph the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Another time on April 5, 1998 Another global surveyor flew over Cydonia and got a picture ten times better than the original Viking picture. The picture revealed a natutral landform, the face was a butte or mesa, landforms that are common around the American west.

This evidence shows that there was no alien monument after all. The face was simple what the Scientist thought it was when the picture was first taken of the face in 1976. IT also shows that the theorist were wrong about NASA wanting to hide the evidence that there is life on Cydonia since alien life would actually benefit NASA.",2,1,0.8415806889533997
8159b69,"Do you think aliens are real? If they are can they make landforms and make them look natural? IN 1976 NASA captured a photo on Mars that looked like a face. Some people thin that aliens made the face. I know that the face is not made by aleins and is a natural landform. The reasons I know this is because there are things like this that happen on Earth. Also NASA says that the face was only shawdos that made it look like a face and they also sent other ships with better cameras to take pictures.

First is that things like this happen on Earth too. The Grand Canyon was a natural thing that happened. Landfroms are common in the west U.S. Rock formations hapen everywhere on earth. Also NASA says this is the equivalent to a mesa. People still did not belive it was natural.

Another reason I know this is natural is because NASA says that the eyes, nose, and, mouth where only shawdos and where not there. People still belived that is was aleins. NASA sent another space ship up to mars to take pictures. So they sent the Mars Global Surveyor up. It can takes picture up to 10 times better than the Viking 1.

Last is the Mars Globoal Surveyor. It flew over cydonia and snapped a photo that was 10 times better than the Viking 1. In the photo you can see that it is only a rock formation. Also in the photo you can see it has not dark spots that where the eyes,nose,and mouth as you can see in the Viking photo. You can still see a what appears to be a mouth in he rock though. In 2001 the MGS took a photo and it has no markings that llok like a face.

Many people would love for a civilization to be on mars but the face is just a natural landform. People are getting worried about possible life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist are trying to make everyone believe something that is not true.

Many people are wondering if the face on Mars is part of martian life or if it just a landform that coincidentally looks like a face. Many peole have asked u ""Why and how does the face look so much like a life form?"" The face is what was once a mesa or large hill of sorts. And it is about 2 miles long from one side to the other. Also there is a possible lava dome under this formation. These landforms or mesa are just the ones we have in the American West, they are everywhere and are extremely common. Just plainly the face looks like a face out of pure coincidence. No matrian life form would make this and if they did we would know about it.

Many conspiracy theorist are asking us ""Why are you hiding the fact the martians have built this 'Landform'?"" If we did have in fact proof that there is in fact life on Mars we would want everyone to come and join us to help us with finding more alien life. We wouldn't just hide one of the largest finds in the world if we id find life on Mars. It would encourage people to look everywhere to try and find more life. But since this is just a landform and not a race of aliens we will have to wait until we find life somewhere. Plus it would help us at NASA as a whole beacuse we don't have much funding and our budget is being cut a lot. This would help regain public view and help all of the people here have better wages and help with finding more things about space.

One of the most asked questions ""How do you know that there isn't life on Mars?"" If we did know there was life on mars there would be a lot of more activity on the planet. The face would have had more detail to it. Another reason why we don't find life on Mars is becasue we would have seen symbols or structures on the surface. It would have been more productful place that what it is now. And if there was any life it would have been long dead and covered over with the dust on Mars. This landform is nothing to get all excited about.

This is just a landform and is just coincidence that it looks like a landform. There is not life on Mars and everyone needs to calm down. We have given high resoloution photos and it is just a mesa. If we do find life or hints that there was martian life we will alert everyone. ",4,1,0.8975447416305542

Have you ever wonderd what the face on Mars is? I have and I'm here to tell you about what I know about this face or piece of land on Mars. Would you discrice the land to be something the alien's made. Well working with NASA has tought me some things. And I will tell you what this face on Mars is now let's get started.

We found out that the face is just a landmark of Mars it's not a face. The way the cloud's were facing and the shadowing made it look like a face. And Now that we know it's not something another race made we don't have to worry as much. We also know that we took that photo in 1976 and again in 1998. We have inproved our cameras by a good amount since the last time we took it. Then when we took it in 2001 the image was much clearer and we could see the photo.

From the text it say's that we took 3 photo's of the site as year's went on. In fact we didn't have high-resolution or 3D image's back then. So we didn't really have the technology back then and now we do. Sending another robot take's year's to get to Mars and time, taking photo's that is another problem. Now that we have better technology for this we can take better picture's.

To explain this the cameras that we had back then really didn't have good pixle resulution. So we really couldn't get a good picture to capture this exciting moment of history. Plus we can now get excited about our trip to Mars later on. And we know what to expect a little bit. They said that we would take off to Mars in 2020 or around that time. And we need trained and willing people to take on the mission.

Now to sum this all up into one paragraph, ok let's see if i can do it. The face of the Alien on Mars really is a landmark not really a alien. By the look of the picture, the weather during the shot of the photo had dust and other partical's that were in the way. And the shadow's made it look like it was a face. And when we attempt to reach Mars in 2020 we know what to expect when the day come's. I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed typing it. Hope that you learned something from this.

Many people where not satified when the photo was tooken because it was winter in April '98 (a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet) the camera on board MGS had too peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.

The picture actually showed an equlevent picture of a nutte or mesa (which are landforms common around the American West).

82830f3,"What are your thoughts of the ""Face on Mars""? I think it is just a natural land form. I think it's just a landform becuase Earth has it's own form like mountains, so it could just be a mountain. There could be other theories that it isn't a landform, but I think that's what it is and here is why. Earth has techtonic plates, Mars might too, so far, we haven't found existing life on any other planets other than earth so Martians couldn't have built something like the pyramids.

To start off, Earth has techtonic plates we have known about them for many years and we know that the plates are always moving. With the plates always moving that's what formed the Himalaya Mountains and is what casuses them to continue getting taller. I think the ""Face"" on Mars is just and example of techtonic plates that are costantly moving and making the ""Face"" more definant every few years. Just the same way as the Himalayan Mountains not every year do we see a direct change in height with just our eyes. We have to measure it out to find out how much those plate techtonics have moved. That is what I believe is happening with the face, I think that since we aren't able to view it every year and measure how much more defiant it is that the year before or if it has even changed.

There's two sides to every argument here's the other side. If the face hasn't changed we could just asume there was life on mars that built it, but as technology increases and we can have a better view of the face and see how much more defiant it was from 1976-2001. It would be a more logical idea to think that it is just the planet moving or plates shifting. SInce on April '98 it was a cloudy day and winter perhaps alien markings were hidden by the clouds.

Although, as I continued reading in the passage, on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia they were able to get a second looke at the Face. In 2001 the resolution was much better and you could see the image more clearly. Garvin said, ""As a rule of thumg, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the airplanes on the ground or the Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The picture actually shows the Martian equalicant of a butte or mesa landforms common around the West in America. Since the photo can go up to high amounts of resolution and we should be able to see of there is proof of Marian life and their buildings, I don't think a real thing. RIght now the face looks like a natural land form.

To conclude my argument that the face is just a natural landform, I would have to say even though, there are some conspircy theories only one thing can be proven to be correct in science. Earrth has techtonic plates and so there's a great chance Mars does to, then only thing that could lead anyone to belive there was life on Mars would be the one photo that was taken in April of '98 when it was cloudy and winter. Lastly, there hasn't been any evidenve of life on Mars or any other planet, so therefore it was just a natural landform on the planet. ",4,1,0.7527451515197754
82a825d,"This is not created by aliens, it was created by landforms and only landforms because aliens are not smart. What would they do with a face, just make a rock out of it? Scientists agree that is was created by natural landforms.

The only way it could have been created is by natural landform that happen way longer than when they dicovered the face. In paragraph 7 it says ""Revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien minument after all"". That states that there was no aliens involved with the face. What would aliens use to make the face in the rocks?

Scientists say that in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West"". So this means that it doesn't really have any evidence that aliens made it. This just means that it very well could be just natural landform creating things.

But, some people may think like the people in paragraph 8. "" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze"". So right now it shows that there could be a possibility that aliens could have made the Face. This one piece of evidence could be the evidence they are looking for.

In conclusion, no one knows what made this interesting Face on Mars. But we do have a lot of information about what could have made it if it wasnt aliens. When we don't have a lot of information here, we can not really think what this Face was made by. All in all we think this Face was made by simple natural landform.    ",3,1,0.8583283424377441
82bb7d4,"Twenty five years ago the Viking 1 spacecraft was taking pictures of Mars, when the spacecraft got a picture of something that looked like a human face, they named it the Face. Scientist from NASA have done futher research on the Face and think that it is a mesa, but others think that the Face was created by aliens. The Face on Mars is simply, a natural landform, and was not created by aliens like some people think.

When the scientist discovered the Face they were very excited because they thought it was something special, but the feeling was short lived. The scientist figured out it was a Martian mesa, which is very common around Cydonia. To better describe the Face would be to say it is: a huge rock formation that respembles a human head. A mesa is a rock formation and rocks can look like all kinds of things, even a human head.

Pictures were taken of the Face in 1976, 1998, and 2001 the resolution on the pictures getting better as technology advances. If one simply looks at the pictures they could tell that the Face is just a rock and it was not alien-made. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original pictures, it was then that the scientist decided that the Face was a rock. The people were still in denial, so NASA set out to get more pictures in 2001. When the pictures came back it was clear that the Face was still just a mesa and was not made by aliens.

At this point the scientist were satisfied, the Face was just a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. One scientist even compared it to things on Earth. Scientist Jim Garvin said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". The Face is a mesa that was formed naturally just like a mesa on Earth. They both look the same and were not created by aliens.

The Face that was found on Mars in 1976, was not made by aleins and is just a mesa that was formed naturally. Multiple pictures determined that it just happened to look like a human face and upon closer examination was not alien-made. The Face has been compared to things on Earth like a butte or a mesa multiple times. This proves that the Face was not made by aliens and is a natural Martian mesa.  ",3,1,0.889257550239563

In my opinion I think that it's a natural landform. I have 3 examples, first when the camera captured the picture it wasen't clear enough because there were wispy clouds. Second in the artical it said ""it spotted shadowy likeness of a human face"". Third the artical aslo said ""formed by shadows giving the illusison of eyes, nose, and mouth.

First the camera captured the picture, but it wasen't clear enough because when they captured the picture there were wispy cloud which can make it hard to take a picture or to see the picture. This example shows that they might of seen something else such as the face ,but it could be wrong because they captured the picture when there was wispy clouds.

Second in the artical it said ""it spotted shadowy likeness of a human face"" which can mean that when the picture was captured the camera could have of captured some shadows to which can create an illusion of a face when in reality it could be the showdows. This example shows that the camera captured the shadows which can create and illusion of a face.

Third in the artical it also said that ""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This can mean that people see it in many way's. the picture creates an illusion that can make you think that it's a face with eyes, nose, and mouth. This example shows that the picture wasn't taken right which can cause an illusion, many people see a face, but that's because the picture creates an illusion of a face.

In conclusion many people have different opinions some say aliens created it, but say is a natural landform. Some people may have counter calims first counter claim is why would NASA lie to us. Second counter claim is that the picture showed a face so it is a face. Third counter claim is that they had a good camera so if it shows it then it is a face. My rebuttals would be that NASA is not lieing about the pictures. Second the picture might create an illusion that makes you think it's a face. Third not all cameras show exactly what you want to take a picture of these are my counter claims and rebuttals and also my example and explanantions.      ",3,1,0.7376861572265625
82c9864,"I believe the face on Mars was not created by aliens. I believe the face is just a natrual land mass that looks like a face from far away. It's almost as if you were to see a person you think you know, but as you get close enough to see their face you dont know them at all.

I believe the face on Mars is a natrual land mass for many reasons. One main reason is that the face is just and elevated area of land. Over the past years many astroids and space debre have hit or landed I could say on Mars. So if astroids landed on the elevated space in places where the eyes, nose, and mouth should be making it look as if a face was on Mars. The article states that the rock formation was as if it was an illusion of the features of a human on the mountain of rock. Another reason is that in the past the ""Face on Mars"" could have been a mountain. Meaning that the winds, dust, and dirt could have worn down the mountain making it into a mesa. The article states that many mesa's have been spotted around Cydonia, making it possible for the ""Face on Mars"" to be just another mesa. The article staes that NASA have taken many pictures of the face and they all revealed ""a natrual landform."" NASA stated that there was no alien monument. Another reason is that Mars used to be an active planet. So if the ""Face of Mars"" used to be a mountain it could have got run down by lava flows in the area. Making it into a landform thta looks like a face.

In conclusion there are many facts and theories about the ""Face on Mars."" People who think the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens will have a much tougher time proving that it was created by aliens. Therefore there is many more facts about the ""Face on Mars"" being a natrual land mass. These are just some of the reasons why I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural land mass.",4,1,0.8991175889968872
82d0240,"Do you think the face on Mars is a natural landform? According to many scientists and conspiracy theorists, the face on Mars is a natural landform. Nasa spoke out about the face on Mars. Also, Michael Marlin and Garvin shared their opinions on the face. The face on Mars is a natural landform because of what the picture revealed,showed, and had captioned.

The face on Mars had a caption from Nasa. After the discovery of the picture, Nasa unveiled the image for all people to see. The picture had a caption noting a huge rock formation. The formation resembles a human face. It has a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a noes, and mouth.

The face on Mars had revealed somthing. Michel Malin and his Mars orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a sharp picture. The picture was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. The website revealed a natural land form (meaning there was no alien momument).

The face on Mars showed somthing to Garvin. The picture actually shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. It reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain is a lava dome. It takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

The face on Mars resembles a natural landform. There is alot of evidence to support this claim. Such as Michel Marlin's,Nasa's, and Garvin's evidence.

The only reason that they think it was aliens because everyone around the world always talk about how aliens live on mars! You can tell by how the face looks like that it is a human face. The reason that make it look like an alien face because of how long it had been there for,and that was about twenty years,and also that its covered up with rocks and dirt.

But to let you know that its not a person that aliens had created,because if you look at paragraph seven that Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), took good,very sharp picture of it,it revealed . . . a natural larmform.

That it was no alien monument after all. But they had to get more evidence to really make sure that it was a ordinary human and that was not created by aliens because lots of people belive was not satisfie,and actually belive that it was created by humans.

So whe they look back at it they discover somthing, they discoverd that it was a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. And thats what had lead people to know that it was landform human face.     ",2,1,0.8900917768478394

I understand that some people may think otherwise, but scientists figured out that it is just another Martian mesa. Meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars.

We have taken three pictures of the face and studied them intensly. It doesn't matter how much better the picture is because it is proven that it is a natural landform. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see that they were!

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. I really do not understand why or how people think that aliens created this landform. Why would they have done it? What would it be for? Why would they just make a huge, random, human like head? I do not know. You have scientists proving that this is just a landform and yet you still have people who doubt the logic. There will always be people who doubt the logic.

We took a picture on April 5, 1998. Thousands of anxious wed surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. No surpirse there. But even after that not everyone was satisfied. Skeptics said that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. So on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day- we took another picture. The photo was extraordinary. This photo proved a lot of skeptics wrong, but there will always be those people who doubt.

Nevertheless it is proven that the face on Mars is not created by aliens and that it is just a natural landform. It will always be a natural landform. Nothing else. I guess some people are just determined to make life interesting. And by all means life is what you make it. The face on Mars will never be forgotten of course, but without the suspician of aliens the face is not that interesting to many people. The face might be fun to learn about, but its not something you will remember throughout your life.    ",4,1,0.9128381013870239

The face on Mars is fake because on the day the face was first seen, outside was verry foggy.

This means that the cameras would have to see through haze.

However some still thought that the face was made by aliens, even though it was winter and in bad wheather.

Then later we took a picture of the face on a clear day and didnt see a face.

This makes me think that there has never been a face on Mars

Another reason that I think that the face on Mars is fake is because the statue was to be aproxamently two miles long and maybe even longer.

This makes it seen unreasonably tall.

If the face were to be two miles tall then that would mean that many of the other rocks would be smaller, but they are not actually the surrounding rocks are much bigger.

My last reason that I think that there isnt a face is because our pictures arn't the best.

The cameras that took the original picture took 43 meters per pixel, and the camera that took the picture in 2001 made a pixel every 1.56 meters.

This leads to the fact that no face had ever been found on Mars.

Only the camera made it look like a face.

I think that the face on Mars is fake because on the day of the original photo the wheather was foggy and the camera had to see through the fog, I also think it is fake because the face was aproxamently 2 miles long which is a verry big rock, the last reason I think it is fake is because the pictures taken were verry bad camera and on lt had a little amount of pixles.

The fog made it nearly impossable for the camera to take a clear picture of the mountain on Mars.

The face was also suposed to be about two miles tall which means that this mould be a verry big rock, but the rock besides it is much bigger then it.

The old cameras that NASA owned were bad compared to what the more modern pictures were taken with.

82ff441,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a very conterversal subject that has people in awe about the very thought of exteresterial life, but is it really a sign? Many people, and even scientists, think so, but it still isn't convicing enough to many. There are many theories it could be. It could just be natural landforms like a butte or mesa or maybe is just a marking of a impact of somekind that formed the shape of a face coincedently. Like I said before, the story of the ""Face on Mars"" is very mystery story but I think it is all a joke.

Scientist have gathered many pictures of the ""Face on Mars"" and have studied them very throughly. One conclusion they came to was that it was a natural landform. The landform they thought it most looked like was like a mesa or butte because of the height of the face is most like a isloated mesa, as said by Jim Garvin. There are many buttes and mesas out around the American West as well, the face being a mesa or butte isn't uncommon. That is one theory scientists think the ""Face on Mars"" is.

They other theory, that I pose is that it may just be a coincedense that a faced formed because maybe something from outer space like a meteor or asteroid hit the planet at that location. It is possible because the moon and other planet have craters, so why can't Mars. This is the other theory that I think the ""Face on Mars"" was formed.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is a very conterversal subject. Scientist think it is just landform like a mesa or butte. I think it is a result of a impact of somekind resulting in a ""face"" on mars. That is why I think aliens didn't create the ""Face on Mars"".    ",3,1,0.8632182478904724
82ff8fe,"The Face on Mars was not made from an ancient alian civilization. We have proof of this because our cameras are ten times sharper than the cameras we had to orginally photograph the face, the shadows just create an illusion that the formation is a face, and the Face on Mars has been confirmed to just be a mesa.

The first photo we had of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976 by Viking 1, which would not have had the most advanced cameras. The photo is blurry and unclear, not a very reliable source to base alien belief on. Even the photo in 1998, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking phtos."" Compare the photo from 1976 to the photo taken in 2001. The 2001 photo clearly shows that the Face on Mars is in fact not a face at all. Any belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens should now be wiped away because of how clearly the photo shows that the Face is just a landform.

When the original photos were taken in 1976, there was the illusion that there was a face staring right back at the Viking 1. Shadows around the Face created this illusion that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh. When the 1976 photo was released for people to see, the caption read, ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Even the experts immediately recognized the Face on Mars as just a natural landform with shadows.

Though some people believed the Face was an alien artifact, this theory is disproved quickly because in truth the Face on Mars is just a mesa. The Face on Mars is in the area of Mars known as Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having lots of Martian mesas. Martian mesas are very similar to mesas or buttes found in the American West. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Jim Garving quotes, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a lava dome the takes the form of an isolated mesa, and is approximately the same hight as the mesa known as the Face on Mars.

Though some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa. This is proved true by the advanced camera quality, the proof that it was just shadows creating the illusion that the Face on Mars was actually a face, and the fact that the Face has been confirmed to just be a mesa.",4,1,0.8496564626693726

So infact it is not an artifact of a alien civilization because there are landforms just like it on earth from domes of lava that take the shape of an isolated mesa.

If this was an actuallly conspirasy than why is it not being hidden from us. ""Although few scitests believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the REad Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" They did not take more pictures becasue they believed that there was some kind of alien artifact, they took mare pictures because the pictures they had from before were eighteen years old. So things on mars could have changed during those eighteen years.

There is no evidence for aliens having built the Face and, saying the Face is a natural landform makes much more sense.

Some people have said that it has been built by aliens but NASA is just hiding the evidence. NASA would not hide such evidence even if there was any. NASA would be able to profit if they found proof of ancient or modern lifeforms that built the Face. NASA would receive a bunch of funds to go explore Mars, there would be many people lining up to go, and many more positions at mission control buildings would open up. This would give NASA a lot more oppurtunities to go explore and make money.

Other people have been saying that maybe the evidence hasn't been found yet, but aliens have built the Face.

Pictures haven't shown huts or any other buildings where aliens could have lived. There are also others who say, ""How does a natural land formation end up looking like that?"" Well, the features on the Face are really just shadows of higher points on the Face or holes in the Face. There are also many landforms on Earth similar to the Face such as buttes or plateaus.

Some people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens or any kind of life on Mars, and NASA is trying to keep the public from knowing.

The first reason is that it has been confirmed by NASA that the human face is just an illusion! This illusion created by shadows gives it the appearance of a human face. Now some people may believe that NASA is saying that it is an illusion because they want to hide that they have been given a sign of life in space. Most people do not know that if there was life on Mars then NASA would benefit, which I will speak more about in the next paragraph.

The second reason to convince you that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform is that if there was life on Mars, it would be no secret! NASA would financially benefit from life on Mars. Think of all the publicity NASA would get and how much money that would bring to them, they could fund a lot more programs and projects.

The third reason is that we can not question the power of the technology they have at NASA. NASA has taken several looks at the face and each time the results are the same. They have extraordinary cameras and photography technology at NASA. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, most common in the American West.

The first reason is that the ""Face"" isn't even a face. People only thought it was before because that is what the picture showed them. Now, with higher resolution pictures, it is very clear that this is not a face. It is a mesa.

Another fact to prove that this is a mesa, is the region that it was found in. Cydonia is a region on Mars that mesas are very commonly found in. If the face was some kind of landform, it would make sense to be a mesa taking into consideration of what it looks like and what region it is in.

Some people might argue that you cannot see the face clearly since it s usually very cloudy over that region. Well on April 8, 2001, a spacecraft went over the face on a clear day and got a picture. Because of the resolution of the picture, if there were any sort of planes or pyramid-like buildings, they would be very easy to see.

So, there are the facts. The landform looks like a mesa. You can tell by the high resolution picture that was taken. And it is in Cydonia, a region full of mesas.

This Face looked like a human face. Reaseaches was amazed how this face popped up on mar's. The face was talked about all around the world. It was in magazines, books, and radio talk showes. This face on mar's was amazing at time. It started out in Hollywood and started to spread around.

The face on mar's started to die out of it's fame. Then reaseaches came a cross it again but this time flew over it and took a photo of it again. This time the reaseaches could see a little more deatail of the face. This took place in 1998. The NASA say they flew over it for the first time.

Reaseachers study on it really hard but thire mission faulted again. Everyone says that they think it was from alliens. Even a few reaseachers say they think it was from alliens. It was hard for them to see if it was from alliens or not.

You can't just look at an unusual figure then automatically assume that it's something totally different without even observing the details around that object. Few scientists believe the 'face' was an alien artifact, though it was just a mesa.

It takes a lot of time and money for the correct equipment to take in and to judge whether or not this is a face. People have taken many missions and explorations to Mars snapping photographs as soon as they could get a good shot of it.

In today's generation people have a better chance to prove somebody wrong or right by getting evidence. Luckily technology is more advance and accessible, so the evidence will be more clear and approving to your target. Though it's very hard to spot your target in outerspace, the Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine. The Mars Global Surveyor was close enough to get another view. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the firld of view. They captured a photo using the camera's maximum resolution. The picture was better than the phone that was taken 30 years in the past. The picture was actually shown to be the Martian equivalent of a mesa. ",2,1,0.8299983143806458

People have even proved that it was a shadow on the landform. You can also conclude that there are no alien's roaming around in space making face's on landform's.

People have no evidence that there are alien's roaming around in space. Alien's are only in the movie's that you see, that's only my opinion though. Even if there were alien's out there, we should have found them by now. With all our space gadget's that we have that can look deep into space, i'm pretty sure we would have found alien's by now.

Even though people have ""spotted"" alien UFO's, they have no proof. People could have said they even spotted it, but then again since their on video, they could have photoshopped it.

Different forms on the surface of a planet is just a natural landform because, their is no life on any planet except for Earth, NASA does real reasearch, the theories are just statements that you can't depend on.

First of all, there is no life on the planet of Mars. For example, they would of seen life when they took the picture. Also, it states that it just looks like an unusual landform. Finally, Mars is to cold for any life because that is why the astronauts have to where suits.

Second, NASA does actual research. For example, NASA actually goes up and looks at it. Also, states that when they went up to the planet they snapped pictures of the ""Face"". Finally, the text stated that it was a huge rock formation that looked like a face.

Lastly, the people that making theories are not always true. For example, the text states that when NASA took the picture, they came up with a theory that claimed ""it was too hazy to see any life."" Also, it stated that they came up with theory that stated that NASA is hiding information about it looks like a bona fide which is evidence that there is life.

Some peopl might think that there is life on Mars because it looks like a bona fide. They are wrong because the picture that was taken didn't include any sign of life.

In conclusion, there is no life on Mars. The pictures didn't show anything about life. Also, the NASA actually goes up to Mars and checks it out. Finally, the theories that are made can't be depended on because they didn't check it out. There is no life on planet Mars.",3,1,0.7521287798881531

It looks much like a landform equivalent to a butte or mesa which are common in the American west. shadows around give the illusion to the eyes that this strange figure has eyes, a mouth, and a nose.

Proof has been found from high tech cameras that shows that this is just a landform and was not created by aliens. After we found the what seemed to be alien markings we decided to look again. Its has the same height as some natural landforms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. If they was anything that could have left a mark by aliens we would've been able to see it.

You can dipect the size of something in a photo 3 time larger in real life. So if there was anything on Mars that shows aliens were there than we would definately be able to see it, but there is none so that leads us to the conclusion that this odd looking figure is just a natural landform and not built by anybody.

To conclude my arguement on whether or not this strange looking figure is actually made by extraterrestrials or just there by nature I belive this is just a natural landform. There is proof and that it was not made by aliens and none that shows aliens made this figure. We used our best equipment to find an answer by research and strongly belive in our answer. There are no markings of aliens of any sort on Mars that could have built this figure. There is an illusion that this shape is in the shape of a face, but isnt really.

Firstly, when NASA got the first picture, I concede that it looked somewhat alien-like, however, that was a huge misunderstanding. A more closely taken picture shows that it is, in fact, a natural landform. I know this because when the picture was taken, there was no alien monument. Therefore, no aliens, right? But the wispy clouds that were there when this picture was taken, envoke skeptics. A third picture silences them.

Secondly, once the skies above Cydonia (the place on Mars where the face is) are cleared, they go in for the third picture of the face. This picture proves to be the of the best quality. Stated in in the text, it reads, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.""

Proving this photo to be the most accurate. And when they examine the photo,it shows that the picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, common landforms in the American west. Garin then says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

With the clearest pictures taken, we can all see that the planet of mars has no aliens, for the Face is a natural landform.

NASA would send space crafts and rovers to Mars so we could study the creatures. Finding out how to survive on mars and the other planets is important and is something humans should learn how to do just in case if something happens to earth and we aren't able to go back to it.

The proof is that a little while later after the face in Mars was found scientists figured it was only a Martian mesa, something that was common around Cydonia. The only reason why it looks like a face is because it had unusual shadows on it.

The other reason why I beleive aliens didn't casue the face was because the authors of magazines and other articles thought it would be a good way to enguage the public and attract attention to mars and it worked. Plus when Mars Global Surveyer flew over the area one more time to get a better shot at the face it reavealed that it was just another normal landform and not an alien monument.

It was neraly two miles from end to end. Scientists have discoved that it was just another Martian mesa it was close to be around the Cydonia. But this one had shadows that made it kinda look like a Pharaoh from Egypt. NASA only put on the newspaper""huge rock formation.....which resembles a human head.....formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth."" They put that on there to get the people worked up and make them worried and excitied. If it was ailens like they believed, dont you think that they wouldnt of stoped the search?

They said it was good for the people and the taxpayers. I dont think that would of stopped them. I think that sciencetist found out that it was just a landform and didnt want to tell people about it. So they stoped the Viking Mission search and told the news that it was for the taxpayers. \

Apil 5,1998 was when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. The team snapped picture. They were shaper pictures than before, people were waiting day and night for this one picture of them. When they got out it proved that it was just a landform. Even then people like you, still didnt believe them. So the people came up with that "" The Face on Mars is located at 41 degress north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998.It is a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.Pehaps, said skeptics aliens marking were hidden by haze."" Why would people say this? The camera they used was ten times shaper than before on the Viking Mission. Even if it was cloudly they still would of gotten closer and got a clear image of that is looked like. And they did but you people still wont believe them.

Something very mystereous happened in mars 25 years ago. NASA discovered a landform in mars that looked like a very large face. When NASA looked closer in they decided it looked like a pharoh, which is like an old egyptian god. Ever since NASA revealed the mysterious face has become a big pop icon, has starred in movies and multiple talk shows. There has been only very few scientists who belived the face was made by aliens. NASA was very interested in the face so they started taking closer and closer looks. NASA used more powerful lenses which let you get a better look at it.

We here have had also weird land forms happen here on our own plant .Sometimes we see rockes even here that look like faces but we do not think they are human face's or an animal face's. Landforms can be sometimes surprising on how they form. They can look as if it was something when it really is nothing at all. That is what happened at Mars a landform formed and it got the shape of a face but we know that Mars has not had live of people on it yet of course .We also know that no human has gone to Mars or landed their to proove it is a face when we know it is not. No human has lived on Mars so how can we say it is a human face when NASA has done alot of reascearch that only people have lived on earth not on any other plant so far. People also know that aliens do not exsite. Landforms can sometimes counfuse us to think something else that does not even excite at all. But like always NASA well be doing more rescearch to show people it is just a normal landform that just some people think it is face but it is not.

Face or not face we will one day see who is right the people that think it is a face or the people that do not think it is a face.

The face people may think is an alien artifact may not be an alien. It could simply be a natural landform. Most people call it the face on Mars.

The picture that was shown revealed that the face on mars is equivilent to a butte or mesa. The butte and mesa are landforms coomon around the American West. Garvin, a NASA scientist, said

""The face is a lava dome that takes the for of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.""

85e497c,"Things aren't always as they appear, just because it looks that way doesn't necessarily mean that it is that way. The formation on Mars does look like a face but it is just a land formation it's not like land formations are rare. Coincidences happen all the time, this is just one of those times. You can't judge something based on how it's looked, you have to really pay attention.

Formations are a very common thing, both on Earth and on Mars. It is nothing strange, what is strange is that it looks like a head. But even at the picture was taken in 1976 with a much lower quality of camera so things wouldn't have looked as clear as a more modern camera, the other picture was taken in 2001, technology would have advanced and improved much in that time span as it was 25 years later. The quality would have improved so it would have been much easier to see and to know what it really was, it was just a coincidence and coincidences are just as common as land formations.

Coincidences happen a lot, and this is just one of the instances that it happens. It may look like a face and something that was made but when you look at it again, with a different perspective you see what it really is. Like sometimes you will have food, like chips and it will look like a face or an object, but just because it looks like that doesn't mean that is that. Or sometime you will see something, but then have to look again to see if that's really what you saw, it's the same concept. Just because you see it doesn't mean it is that or that is even there. Magic is a good example as it is just an illusion, it's happening in front of you but that doesn't mean it's actually there, because when you see how it's really done it's not so magic. The clouds may look like animals floating in the sky but they are still just clouds. All of this brings it back to the same point, that the land formation may look like a face that was created but when you really look at it and realize what it is you know what it really is, just another land formation.

You may say that aliens made something like this but that just doesn't make sense. That's like saying that people made the Grand Canyon or that people made the Rocky Mountains. These things would have made by what was there and things that affected them, not by people or aliens. There is no evidence that aliens even exist, so with lacking that proof how can you say something that never existed or at least something that is unable to be proved existed made this.

It all loops and loops and loops. You end up with the same thing and it just becomes repetitive. You can say that aliens made this but you lack proof, where as it's just a land mass has plenty of evidence to back it up. It is just a coincidence that it looked like a face.",4,1,0.7757108211517334

Although it may look like supernatural it has been proven that its nothing more than nature at work.

In Cydonia, the area in which this landmark was found, it is quite common for Martian Messas to form although in this case the shadows gave this land mark facial like features as mentiond in paragraph 2 of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". Paragraph 3 continues to bring this point our by saying ""The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.""

If thats not enough to convince someone that its just a natural landform then paragraph 7 mentions that when Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a 10x sharper picture of this formation, it appeard on a JPL web site that revealed it to be nothing more than a landform. Afterwards they went back a while later, as mentioned in paragraph 10-11, and took another picture that was even clearer and closer to the point of where if there was anything such as an airplane or shack hidden in this rock, it would be seen. When taking the picture it mentioned in paragraph 12 that it was in fact nothing more than a butte or messa which is a common landform in the American West.

Defenders claimed that this theory was invalid because life of Mars would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide it? To further their claim that the ""face"" didn't prove life on Mars NASA decied to take more HD pictures of the landform.

In 1998, NASA took picture of the face that were easier to see and 10x sharper than the originals.

The photo NASA relesed was astonashing and the people thought so too. The face on Mars quickly became popular and was in TV shows, books, magizines, and talk shows.

I believe that the face on Mars is a natural landform and was not created by ailens or another form of life.

The area of Mars where the face was found is called Cydonia and these natural landforms are common there. It is clear Mars is not inhabitable and it's impossible for life to exist there. NASA said that it was a common Martian mesa and it was just how the shadows fell that gave to appearence of a nose, eyes, an mouth. This makes pefect sense considering how common the mesas are. They all look like something this one just happened to be a face. There is no evidence of ailens to create this huge artifact nor proof that it was man made.

The Face on Mars was very popular and widely known. People still disagree on how it was created but I believe it ws natural. All signs point to that. There will always be people who say it is more than a mesa and that it is an ancient ailen artifact but I think they are wrong. NASA, scientists, and thousands of people have concluded that it is a common landform and nothing more than that. I choose to believe that it was not ailens and it was by pure luck. Some believe dfferently but there is no proof to support that theory. ",3,1,0.9125428795814514
86e07ef,"The planet, Cydonia was discoved to have a face-shaped figure that stretched two miles long! Although some people believe that alien-life or some life-form has occurred or is still occurring to this day. I believe that the face figure is just another natural formed landmass like several we have on earth. For instance the Middle Butte found in the Snake River Plain of Idaho has a lava dome which takes form of a messa.

In paragraph eleven of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", Garvin says, ""As a thumbs rule, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger then the pixel size, So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what there were!"" This explains that there is no way of showing or providing any evidence of aliens or lifeform on Mars.

The author also mentions that Garvin says, ""It;s not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it's hard work."" In this paragraph nine it also consentrates about the angle it is looked apon. I feel like if it was hard to find the perfect angle and measurements to take a closer look at the face, there could have been mistakes made without realization.

Even though no one knows whether or not if there was or life on Mars or if there still is. The likelyhood of this theory is very low. There would have to be a water supply, nutrients to feed off of, sunlight, shelter, etc. for any living organisms to survive.

Everyone should be allowed to have their own beliefs, but sometimes people believe in things that are hardly believeable. This could help save time and convience for in the future whenever NASA finds solid evidence that there is no evidence of aliens on planet Mars. Even if NASA would like the fundings for finding existance of lifeform, it would also be a great discovery that there isn't because they could narrow the list of safe planets us ,humans, could live on if there was any kind of diaster to happen to our planet.

Many people for twenty-five years have wondered if the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars' was really made by aliens and if could be a accient artifact left behind by aliens. ""The Unmasking the Face on Mars"" had probably lead lots of people to thinking that their could be a really big chance of aliens being real. Ever since the face on Mars was discoverd lots of people thought that their really could be alien life it could be just a natural piece of landform on the planet Mars. If you look closley at the 1976 picture its a low quality picture since its from 1976 than twenty-three years later in 1998 it was taken again lots of people who had seen it were not sastisfed it was a winter april in 1998 it was also a cloudy time of year on Mars. Even though the cameras took the picture ten times sharper it had been really cloudy so you could barley see the picture to have real proof if it was created by aliens. Later in 2001 they had gave it a other shot making it the most recent. The 2001 picture had still been some what the same as the 1976 picture. To me its just a normal natural landform that was created itself by the planet. lots of things on earth look like other things it is just the way the landfrom is created into.",2,1,0.8932414650917053
873636f,"The Face, an interesting topic to many people. Although some people question its formity. Is it a natural landform? Or was it created by Aliens? People have their opinions on what it is but after doing more research from NASA, this article explains what the Face really is. It gives you background information to help understand what the Face is, a natural landform.

""The Face has been seen by multiple NASA scientists. Many argue that it was created by Aliens while others argue the Face is just a natural landform. In paragraph three of the article it states ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles as a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The paragraph said it was a rock formation, which is part of natural landform. The Face was just a rock forned like a human head and that only the shadows are giving out an illusion of a human face. After a few years scientists went back to Cydonia to explore more about this odd structure. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiters camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial Viking's photos. On a JPL web site it was revealed that there was no alien momentum after all, it was just a natural landform. People were still not satisfied with this research. So on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor went back to Cydonia to snap more pictures of the Face. Once he got the picture, the text states in paragraph twelve ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a Butee or messa-landforms common in the American west.""

This article gives more research and information about the Face being a natural landform then it does about it being created by Aliens. In some paragraphs the text gives you background information to understand that the Face is a natural landform. People may still have their thoughts about it being created by Aliens but as NASA explores more about this structure they have all the proof they need to prove that the Face is yet another natural landform.",3,1,0.8810963034629822
8784f93,"Have you ever wondered if the face on Mars was created by aliens? The face on Mars was not created by aliens it is a natural landform. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team got a picture of the face that was good enough to see that the face had no alien monument.

Some people think the face on Mars is created by aliens or think it's bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Scientist Michael Malin found out the right answer. That the face is a natural landform. The camera Michael and his team used was 10 times better than the one used to take the photo of the face in 1976. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program says ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" That quote shows how good the camera is.

Today, people still belive it was aliens who made the face on Mars. But what they dont know is that its really just a landform, thanks to Michael Malin and his MOC team we now know the truth.",2,1,0.9214346408843994
87bfbd7,"Do you believe in aliens creatinf landforms on planets? Than you might've heard about the Face on Mars being created by aliens. It's possible that it is not created by aliens, there is a possibility that is was created by a naturally. The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

The Face is a landform that was not created by aliens. Nobody really has evidence that it was created by an aliens. Several people do belive it was created by aliens though. But there is also no scientific research or evidnce that aliens are real. Which all leads up to, ""Is the Face on Mars really made by aliens?"" the answer is no

Micheal Malin and his team snapped a photo of the Face that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. In the last sentence, paragraph 7 in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it states that there is no alien monument after all. This is because the landform was made naturally not by aliens.

This shows that is is possible for the landform to be made naturally and not by aliens. The landform has no sign that an aliens was around the landform either. Which is why the lanform is natural, not built by some other thing such as an alien.",2,1,0.850844144821167
87cd32d,"Is it possible that the face on Mars could have been created by aliens? Some people believe that the Face on Mars was formed by aliens; however,

I do not believe that is possible. A few of the pictures taken of the Face on Mars were taken when it was cloudy,but that is the only information that suggests that aliens could have made the face. Many scientists have done extensive research on the Face on Mars, and they have found that it is nothing more than a natural landform in the shape of a face. If you believe aliens formed the face on Mars, then be prepared for multiple facts that go against that belief.

Numerous scientists have studied the area in which the surreal face formation is located, and they have found various mesas. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the place in which you would find the face. Because of these facts, it is believed that the Face on Mars is just another Martian mesa that is coincidently shaped like a face. NASA even captioned one of the pictures saying ""Huge rock formation that was formed by shadows, giving the illusion of a face."" This explanation makes a tremendous amount of sense more than aliens creating the face.

Although quite a few people vehemetley express their opinions that the face is evidence of life on Mars, NASA says that they are not hiding any information about alien life. Why would NASA keep life on Mars a secret? If life was found on Mars, NASA would share the information because they would make a lot of money from it. They would make history if they had proof of life in Mars! Some defenders of NASA even wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. There is absolutely no way that NASA would turn down that amazing oppurtunity and keep the evidence to themselves.

The picture taken by Michael Malin is another reason to believe that the face was not an alien creation. He took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos by using his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC). The picture taken on April 5, 1998, revealed that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. There was no reason to believe that the face was not natural, but some people still believed that aliensdid in fact make the formation. The tenacious scientists were still determined to find evidence to make everyone see the truth.

April 8, 2001, was a cloudless day in Cydonia, and Mars Global Surveyor was able to get close enough to the face to capture a extraordinary photo.

The picture was taken using the camera's maximum resolution. If there were objects in the picture near the face, you could have seen what the objects were. There was nothing unusual aroung the Face on Mars.

The picture shows a Martion equivalent to landforms common around the American West. It reminds some people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is the same height as the Face on Mars. This evidence supports the idea that the giant, face-shaped formation is a natural landform, nothing more, nothing less. Aliens are not even proved to exist, let alone form a landform like this one.              ",5,1,0.9019745588302612
87e6129,"one reason i think that the face is just natural landform is because it says that viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship. viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. scientists figured it was just another martain mesa, common enought around cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like and egyptaian pharaoh.

In the article it says that The ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. The face icon statted in a hollywood film appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Most people belive that face was an alien artifact, photographing cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars global surveyor (MGS)arrived in red planet sept. 1997.

The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!    ",2,1,0.9011574983596802
882fdc3,"Is it easy to prove that a picture is real or fake ? Well people have thier own opionions. The key is to have information about your argument and be able to respond to a counterargument. If a photo is being climed real, but your not buying it you should have information to back you up.

This ""Face on Mars"" photo is real, and aliens did not make it. It is a natural landform becuase no objects that would be on earth are found in the picture."" You would see because you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size"". The photo was taken many times and NASA finally got a clear picture of it.

About the weather being impossible to shoot a picture because it was winter, thats not true but ""MGS is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips"". It wasnt easy getting a clear picture in the weather conditions. MGS had captured a good final picture with a good angle that made media go crazy.

Our facts have been proven and researched thouroughly. NASA has studied the face and has gotten good picures for everyone to see. The picture blew up and was everywhere, people were fascinated that it looked like a human face. After all the research ... the picture had not been made by aliens, it was a natural land formation.

8865423,"I have just read ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and many people are convinced that the Face, found near Cydonia, is just a natural landform. However, there are also many people who believe this Face to be of extra-terresrial activity. However, NASA has gave us more facts that prove the Face to be a mountain-like landform rather than an extra-terrestrial phenomenon.

First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.

Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,"" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.

Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,"" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution."" Also, paragraph twelve states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West."" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.

In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",4,1,0.871934175491333
8882d49,"I have to help seal the deal that the faces are just nautural land forms and not something supernatural. Even Knowing that nasa wishes there was ancient people living on mars doesnt mean there actually is. They may be very smart people but they have no proof that this was done by a type of living being. They clearly state that everything they get is only facts and off research and strictly that nothing else. These people who are doubting nasa abviously have no idea what there talking about if they think nasa is purposley lying to us. They say that these faces are very normal and common and that this one has very different shadowing to help it look like adifferent face. They have shown many other faces or land forms like this in the past, I would understand if this was the first one and maybe that would give them a litlle reason to doubt them like they did. nasa says they have seen similair things like this on our earth. That should tell you that what is going on now isnt anything different or special to us. I understand why you would think its something crazy special but its really not, nasa them selves got all happy over nothing as well until they got another look at it.

They said they thought it was something they havent seen before but it just ended up being something they really see on a ebery dat bases. Nasa also stated that the types of cameras they used would have easily made it clear to the people that this is normal. These cameras can zoom in so close that they would have been able to see if anything moved they could see it. the only thing that was oving that day was the clouds in the sky which is normal for mars. They said they look for small stacks and things moved and even pyramids but yet nothing was abnormal about this situation. These people make even less since because if it can happen here on our normla land it should be normal for a planet like mars to do it to. Mars is the most similair planet to ours. So if it happen over here why is it so breath taking that it happens over there as well. They say that they shortly live dthis little moment and it ended up being the same old stuff, this place Cyndonia is the most common place to find these landforms shapped by who knows but they can be suspicious and very norml at the same time. They said that they think taht this face would bring much attention to mars and they were absolutly right about that. It makes sence why some poeple think different. I mean everybody has they own point of view on thuings. They wil stick to it to, they will consider them selves right still after you prove them wrong. People will always have there own perspective on things no matter what. so that means that mostly everybody will have some one that disagrees with them one way or another. Since this has opened up to the world in manny different ways, it makes it a whole lot easier to make up assumptions and nad there own way of thinking when it comes to this very starge but normal situation. Poeple have even seen thingslike this on the moon and that didnt phaze a single person. Its just people these days and how they think. they will just pull your leg.",2,1,0.8236442804336548

894d76a,"Most people have seen the mysterious face on planet Mars. There are many possibilities of how that landform got there. Many people in the world believe it came from aliens or some other species. You can think that, but really there is no possible way an alien could have made that. I'm going to explain to you, why that can't be possible.

On the planet Mars, landforms like these form all of the time. People make big deals out of stuff like this, because they are curious just like you. That is why there are movies, books, and magazines about the face. If that was an alien marking, we would have found more evidence about it. Finding the face is very difficult, because of all of the wispy clouds. If there really were aliens, wouldn't they be making more markings? Unfortunatley they haven't, so there is no acutal proof that an alien made this landform.

When we did our research, the landform is actually a butte or mesa. Those landforms are common around the American West. People overthink these situations, and automatically assume that an alien created this. Anything is possible, but when we were searching for the face, it was a cloudy day on Mars. That could have caused the clouds, to make the face appear. The face could have also been the molten rock from lava, and caused it to form. There are many possible ways, but not the way of aliens.

No one has acutal proof of aliens. There has never been one that we have caught. No one has any information on them, or what the alien looks like or how thier personality is. We have no records on any type of alien, and no one else does either. Just like there is no proof an alien made that face on Mars. You can't assume some other life form made a face on another planet. People make quick opinions, and people all over the world will believe it when they have no information about it.

Mars is a very interesting planet, and suprises us very much. Since the first picture was taken in 1976, and then the last one was in 2001, why haven't we seen any aliens? That is why there was no acutal alien who created the face. If you worked at NASA, you would believe us too. I hope we have given you as much information you needed. Now you know there is no aliens up on Mars who created this. We hope you have reasoned your theory about The Face on Mars.",4,1,0.8724424839019775
8951a7f,"What is the face on Mars? The face of Mars is called a mesa which is a type of landform.

Many people believe that this landform wasn't a creation of Mars or mother nature, but others may beileve other wise. This creation has many facts to back up its existence such as a spacecraft watching it at all time, no life has been found, and how could they have created it. So in all alians could'nt have build such a formation only Mars her self could have.

Spacecrafts have help us with so many thing when it come to the topic of outerspace. These technological pieces of art help us find spots to land, help use to see whats the aera is like and so on. But one thing the space craft has proven is that aliens doent exist on mars. The Viking

1 was taking photos at all times of the surface of Mars, so how could have thes so called 'aliens' make it. This question is simple because they couldn't. And based on the information there is no one on Mars so how could it have been.

Mars is a planet not suitable to sustain life on his. Mars does not have suitable breathing air so the likely hood of life beeing there is slim. Most people think aliens have created this hugh structer, but even if there was life on mars how could they have created this structer. Building a structure of this size would take a long period of time that the spacecraft would have eventualy picked up. And by not haveing the right equepment the 'aliens' couldnt have done it.

Building a big structure like this would take time, but would also take a lot of heavy lifting. This landformation is to big to becreated by hand or by hands. The only real logical way that this structure could have been created is by technology, and the only technology even close to Mars is the spacecraft the Viking 1. So it would be impossible for any thing to build soemthing of that size in that amout of time with little resources.

There is a possibility that there could have been something else that created this structure. But we cant look over the fact that there was been no finding of life on Mars. This structures is called a mesa and earth as countless of them so to see one on Mars couldnt be that much of a shocker. And the face appears because of indents in the rock that are slowly going away. So in all its very unlikely that aliens created this landform.

Aliens couldnt have build such a creation only Mars her self could have. This is proven on the information about the spacecraft, how theres no life on Mars, and the creation of it all disprove the fact that aliens could have build this landform.

The messa was revealed to the public as an attraction to gain peoples interset in Mars not to assure proof of aliens. It could not have been created by aliens because it is a natural landform like any other massive landforms on Earth. Also it was revealed to the public to be an attraction.

The messa: ""The Face on Mars"" was discovered in 1976 by a voyager named Viking. The messa was revealed to the public a few days later. The authors reasoned it would draw attention to Mars.

Things like the Appilation Mountains were not created but are natural landforms. the same thing goes for ""The Face on Mars,"" it wasnt created by aliens but is a natural landform.

They used an digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, and because the text states that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or measa landforms common around the American West.""

The first reason why I say that it was not an alien head is because It was just a natural landform. That is because when the had the chance to take the picture they did and when it first appeared on a JPL web site showing that it wsa an natural landform, that it was nothing that you could now but not tell no one. Some people thought that it was still a alien head but had no proof abut it they had proof that it was an landform.

Another reason why I thnk it is an alien head is because they had digtial image 3 times bigger than te pixel size so if something was there they could see what it was, it was best Viking photo ever so they could not have said nothing. You could see almost anything out that picture even something small you could see it so there wa no way that it was an alien face.

Last reason why is becase when they got a look it was actually a ""butte or mesalandforms common around the American West nd it's as common to see around there. I was very hard work in order to do that anyway so if they were wrong why would they waste so much time doing this anyway. When they came back everyone was waiting and when they got the picture it was just an landform and they had so much proof about it to.

So, proof was also given that the mysterious Face on Mars was a natural landform.

Many also believe and say that it looks like Egyptian Pharaoh. Inaddition, people engage to the public and attract attention to Mars. So, humans made it become a pop icon and starred in a Hollyood film,appeared in books,magazines,and radio talk shows.

The Face on Mars is just a regular landforming and not created by the aliens. Even if it looks like Egyptian Pharaoh or mesa there were is no proof of life on Mars to create the face.¨When Mars Orbiter Camera team snap pictures it was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos¨. This means that when Viking snap the picture it was not as clear as this one. Then, when it is not clear you assume something by the way it shape like in this situation.¨ What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West¨( Garvin,article 12 ).

The Face looks like it was created by aliens but why does every landform on Earth looks like it is created by aliens.¨the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, aliens marking were hidden by haze¨( Skeptics,article 8 ). Yes, it may has but this camera has the best pixal size and they could see everything.¨ As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixal size¨( Garvin,article11 ). There is not yet evidence on Mars to proof that aliens are in fact living on Mars. This landform on Mars is just like what we had on the past years on Earth.     ",2,1,0.8892031908035278
89f2ea4,"The Viking 1 photo taken in 1976 is a photo from Mars of what seems to be a face-looking structure. Many believe that this is some sort of alien life form left behind, but some believe the reality, in which this is just some type of land structure or a land-form.

This land structure has shadows and divets on it that resemble the facial details of a human face. NASA has been searching for alien life-forms or any life on another planet for years and some believe that they have finally accomplished this. A lot of people think that this is some sort of fossil or ingravement of a once-living alien or a species of unknown classification.

As this very well could be the case, with the fact that it is sort of engraved into the ground of the planet, the most likely explanation of this abnormality is this--this is a coincidental pattern on this rock-like form. There is no more to it. Coinicidental.

As stated in Paragraph 5, this form has spraked a lot of attention throughout the years. Many people believe many different theories; some reasonable, and some not. Conspiracy Theorists state that they believe NASA is hiding more evidence about this, but that cannot be true, because if this was a life-form, NASA would be rolling in fame, not hiding it from the world.

This is Mars we are talking about. We have tried for years and years to get human life onto this planet, and to attempt at finding life as well. The conditions of Mars are unbearable, so there is no possible way a creature could survive. We're not ET.

As stated in Pararaph 12, Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte n the Snake River of Idaho."" This is most definently a landform. Mars is considered the Red Planet. Mars is covered in dirt, grime, and dust. This could have easily formed with winds hitting the dirts.

As you can see in the progression of the pictures, these are obviously shadows from the sun, or dirt formations. If this was a life-form, these divets in the body would not be fading away, they would stay fossilized and stay put. In 1998, it does not even look like a face, nonetheless in 2001, either.

Next, as you can tell in the lower image featured in the paragraph, you can see another structure just a couple of feet to the left of the ""face"", and nobody seems to care about that. It does kind of look like an animal, so are we just going to question every single little pebble that we find on a planet? Didn't think so.

In conclusion, this 1976 photo taken on Mars by the Viking 1 spacecraft is most definently a landform of some kind. There is no possible way that a creature could sustain life on a planet like this. This discovery is obviously just a hoax or a coincidental find. If scientists had found this structure a couple of years later, it would not have looked like this face, so they would have never even questioned it.     ",4,1,0.7653020620346069
8a1fcce,"In 1976 NASA captured a picture of a landform on Mars . The landform resembeld a blurred face . Many people beleive that this martian ""face "" was created by aliens . However these theories have proven to be false with photos, and common logic.

Since the first sighting of the face more photos have been taken . Each new picture is clearer than the last . A photo taken in the year of 2001 shows the face to be a landform and nothing else . In fact the face is a mesa which is a common landform in the American West.

Some critics support theories that NASA is hiding the knowledge of life on Mars. It would be a giant step in discovery and extremely exciteing if these ideas came to be true but unfortunatly they haven't .

Despite the many theories that surround the face, the face isn't a face at all (though it would be cool if it actually was

8a44244,"On May 24, 2001, about 25 years ago the NASA's viking spacecraft was circling the planet. It then spotted a human like face. It was huge! It was nearly two miles long. It looked like it had been staring back at the camera from where this picture had been taken.

The face is clearly a natural landform. When Mars Global flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin snapped a picture ten times sharper than the first photo. When this picture was taken it was a very cloudy day. This means that the camera had to peer through all the clouds to get this good of a picture. But skeptics say that the aliens images were hidden by the haze. That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform.

This is a great natural landform and it is very questionable at first, if this could really just be a natural landform. But knowing that the NASA has went out more than one time and taken pictures of this face really does show that it is not aliens. Not only have we taken pictures but we have proof. These are all the reasons why it is certain that this face is a natural landform.    ",2,1,0.8373444676399231
8a48d1b,"I think that the face on the surface of mars is a natural landform. I dissagree that it is made by aliens or any living organism.

The reason I think that the face is a natural landform is because if it was made by aliens then I think there would be more of them not just one. With us humans we have many different statues monuments tall skyscrapers not just one of them. For example the pyramids they we obviously were not naturally made but there are many of them that are exactly the same. So if that was made by aliens I feel like there would be many more that resembled the landform or some other odd landforms.

In the 12th paragraph of the article it says this is a martian equivalent of a Butte or mesa so there are many things that are odd that happned naturlly on Earth also. In the passage Garvin said,""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of Idaho"". Garvin also said,""That there is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the face on mars.""

My next point is that many people say that N.A.S.A

is just keeping secrets of aliens away from the public. If there were aliens than N.A.S.A would probably tell them becuase it would get them so much more publicity and therefore probably more money to fund a mission to mars. So I think that would just be a stupid idea if they kept it a secret.

In conclusion I think that the face on mars is a natural landform and not made by alies                       ",3,1,0.8569360375404358

From the looks of it, it would be questionable about aliens becasue it looks like a face that people wouldn't exspect for a landform to look like, but stutistics shows that it was just a landform and nothing else.

You and many other people may want to believe that there was life on mars years ago and it hasn't been discovered yet, if there was ever any life on Mars we would've find many more clues by now. If anyone has read this article then they would know that it is just a landform and there is and never was any sight of life on Mars. In this article it says "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.

But when theres nothing up there and we have half the country thinking there is thats a problem, which we have to let down easily.

So just because it was winter and hard to see you people are telling me that we are wrong? That we are lying? Nope, not true. Even with the pictures from summer...

8a7446c,"There has been a lot of debate circling wether or not the infamous ""Face on Mars"" is an actual alien made structure of a face or just a natural landform. In my professional opinion its safe for me to assume it is just a natural landform.

Although it resembled a face in the first picture it doesn't necesarrily mean it was created by life forms to look like a face. The only features you can make out on the so-called ""Face"" are deep holes for eyes, a pointed part for the nose, and a line for the mouth. It doesn't have any distinct features. If if was made my martians they most likely wouldn't want a monument of a human's face so what is it supposed to be? I'll you what it is butte or mesa, a natural landform that is common on Earth.

Another reason you know it isn't a face is the camera quality of the first image. The camera quality in 1976 wasn't as advanved as today's technology is. The pictures in both 1998 and 2001 were both much more clear than the original photograph. Although you can make out somewhat of a face it doesn't mean thats what it was. It could have just been a blurry picture.

Conspriacy theorists say it actually was aliens and they made the face but NASA would greatly benefit from finding actual life on Mars. If NASA found legitimate alien lifeforms it could benefit the whole world. If they were non-hostile they could teach us how to make and use their technology. We could learn a lot from them, like why the landforms on their planet resemble faces. NASA has been trying to find alien life for years, if they found it they woudln't deny them and say they don't exist.

There are a lot of people that think it has to be a face. And the pictures are from 25 years apart, so anything could have happened to the landform in that long. Natural wear and tear could have washed across the surface of it and rendered it a natural landform. In all seriousness they could be right but it would take a lot more than 25 years to ruin solid rock.

The ""Face on Mars"" had a good 25 year run. It was mostly scaring people and giving conspiracy theorists ammunition to shoot at the government to try to get us to admit there is other life out there, but its time to face reality. It is not a face. It really is a landform. If there was life on Mars you could see it with the cameras we have today, but sadly, no such luck. It's not a face on Mars, we just have imaginations that run wild with wonder.",5,1,0.8987001180648804
8aaa311,"The Face of Mars was created by aliens! No

it wasn't because it was a common landform in Cydonia and it looked like a face because it had unusual shadows that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh. The landform was called a Martian mesa, they are well known for looking like faces and are very common in Cydonia. If you think that aliens created the Face then how would it change over years and be in the land? I think that the landform was created by the erosion in mars and that it happens a lot.

Rock formations like the Face are well known in mars. But the Face was iconic because NASA unveiled the photo that was taken by viking 1 to the whole world and the world was surprised. They thought that the Face was created by aliens of course but that was because it was from a different planet and they didnt see all the other mesas that were in Cydonia. The photo also gave out many illusions of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. So people thought the Face was still created by aliens, but how? It couldnt have happened because the Viking 1 was snapping photos of the land form for 25 years and no aliens appeared in those photos.

The MGS and the MOC showed much clearer pictures than the Viking 1. The photos revealed a natural landfor not created by aliens. But not everyone was satisfied because the photo was taken 41 degrees north martian lattitude whre it was a cloudy time of the year therefore the MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze.

Garvin says ""it's not easy to target Cydonia"" because the MGShad to look down 2.5 km-wide strips. The MGS snapped the picture at he right moment if it didn't we wouldn't have a photo. But in 2001 on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the MGS drew close enough for a second look Malin's team took one last photo in the highest resolution. Each pixel in 2001 spans 1.56 meters wich is way better than the Viking 1 photo in 1976. What the phos showed you ask? The 2001 photo showed what looked like a butte or a mesa often common in the west of the United States. It was a landform not one created by aliens.

""The aliens made it"" you said, but it was a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars. This shows that landform do form in mars and on any planet. Although we don't know if aliens are real or fake they did not make this. To conclude things, The photo that was taken in 2001 gives you a vivid look at how the Face was formed and shows you how lava makes them.

8ab16db,"Face in Mars is Natural Landform

Is the Face on Mars created by an alien? The answer is no, in this paragraph I'm writing some reasons that prove that the face wasn't made by an alien. One of the reasons is that they took a picture 2 sharper. Another reason is that scientist saw a Martian mesa common in mars. And the last reason that I think it's a natural landform is that in 2001 picture 3 show that it was only a mesa.

First in 1998 a Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, or mars, for the first time. A picture was taken and it was ten times sharper. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting to see when the image first appeard on a JPL website. The picture showed that the face was just a natural landform.

Nevertheless, a new high-resolution image and a 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft revealed that the Face on Mars was really a mesa. The scientist thought of it as normal because the mesas are common in mars.

And lastly, another picture was taken in 2001 an better image with more pixels. The camera had cought the camera's absolute maximum resolution. In paragraph 10 the author states that the picture taken in 2001 the image had 1.56 meters per pixel compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

That is why I think that the mesa, or the Face on Mars, is just a natural landform. And that it wasn't created by aliens. That is why I think its just a natural landform.",3,1,0.8168716430664062
8afd659,"Science. Scientific. Fact.

These are the words you should have going through your mind as you wonder about the Mars landform, found by NASA's

Viking 1; The face. The pharaoh. The man on Mars. However, there are some who...Wish to believe.

To these folks, it is also the face. The

Alien. Martian on mars. These, are the people who we call conspiracy theorists. Conspiracy theorists are nothing more than mere people who wish to emphasize something and twist it up to make it, of course, a conspiracy. These said theorists want to change the perspective and point of view via others, and themselves as well.

However, fact cannot be contained.

When it comes to the face on Mars, as previously explained, there is indeed, fact over opinion. In many aspects, not to mention. Landforms, shadows, and shading galore. In pictures, the face seems to contain basic details to give t the ""person"" type of vibe off. However, there is just one problem.

With the face being known as looking human, there are details still missing. Such as, the rest of the body. There would possibly be an outline of something more around the face, or where a body may be. We cannot go down and literally dig on Mars, thereore pictures were, or are the nex t big thing.

There is a lot of shadowing going around on Mars. The thick clouds, the different angles of rays of light shoning through.

This leads us to our final conclusion. The face is a landform. With the precise shadowing and the shape of some sort of facial stucture, who would know what to think. Blaming conspiracy theorists is not a preferred move, however, the theorists may forget to use fact. I believe, fact is that the face is a mere landform. An artwork of space.

Some, however, wish to believe. Maybe, we should let them. ",3,1,0.8246707320213318

The Viking was taking pictures when it noticed a shadowy figure. Can you guess what that figure is? Conspiracy theorists have their own vision of what it was made by, but NASA's scientists had the facts about it!

In paragraph two it says, ""The sensation of the face was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa."" The conspiracy theorists think otherwise. The conspiracy theorists think that the face was made by Aliens. They also think that the face was really think that it was made by Aliens, and that NASA knows it was, but they just do not want to reveal it. Conspiracy theorists think it's Bona Fide, and that it's evidence of life on Mars. This all shows that the conspiracy theorists have different points of view than the NASA scientists do.

In paragraph seven it says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting then the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" When scientists put the image out online not everyone was satisfied with what the scientists said. Conspiracy theorists still think that it was made by Aliens. This shows that the scientists at NASA have facts and that the conspiracy theorists have only a picture.

In paragraph eleven Garvin says, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects in this picture like aiplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" In paragraph twelve it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Garvin added, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This shows that NASA thinks that the face was just a natural landd form.

In paragraph eight it says that the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Now everyone is saying, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" They all think now possibly they were made by Aliens. This shows that we may have made a serious mistake in how the face was made. The face could've been made by both natural forming or by aliens.

In conclusion, the face could have been made by Aliens and we just do not know it. We could have been wrong for all we know! So we need to think to not doubt ourselves. We all need to think, was the face really made by aliens? It could've been! We need to learn to work together on our theories not against each other.

8b21814,"There has always been an argument about the ""Face"" on Mars since it was discovered. Many people believe it is natural, and others think someone made or put it there. A mask that looks perfectly in task can't be a landform, many people say. Since the face has been in magazines, books, and even tv shows, it is considered something everyone has an opinion about. There has been many pictures, and photographs taken of the face. In 1967 it came out as a clear mask, untouched as some would describe how it looked. Scientists and other specialists have studied and researched it as time has passed. Some people say it looks like it belongs with the Egptian culture. Spacecrafts, rockets, and monitors have supervised the face ever since it was found. Debatable I would say whether it is a landform or it is natural. The argument is quite fascinating in many ways. Books have been written about it, talk shows on televison have talked about it, and people have came up with evidence and facts for what they believe of the ""Face on Mars.""

If you are a person like me, you would believe the face is a landform. I could easily tell, and prove it is indeed a landform. It is too close to the sun, you would instantly die. When people found out about Armstrong's trip to the moon, they were excited. But can anyone go to Mars? Of course not, it's way to hot. The distance from Earth to Mars is a wide spread. Going to the moon is one thing, but going to Mars is another. Thinking and dreaming about going to Mars is all nice until you realize it is not possible. Everyone knows you can go into outer space, and the moon. But everyone also knows you can't possibly go to Mars, and come back alive. Plus to get there and back, would be tough. Fuel doesn't last as long as you think it does. Just ask the Apollo 11 crew about that. You have to be prepared and knowing the possibilities on what could go wrong. It also takes a lot of money to go to the moon, think about how much it would be to go to Mars. Nobody could have put that face on Mars. People would think you were insane if you told them that.

The Face is ordinary, there is nothing else like it or even close to it. Everyone has their own belifs and stories of what they think happened. There has been many people who tudied thius face. It is definitely a debate. Hopefully one day we will find the truth. Maybe it will be breaking news like it did when they very first found the face. ",2,1,0.8525810241699219
8b5116e,"Final Draft: Is the Face on Mars really created by aliens? No, the Face is not created by aliens since Mars is also created by land, so it is not unusual if there is a landform that looked like a face. The Face on Mars could have been created by when Mars itself was being created. Many people may think the Face is a alien artifact, but it is based on an opinion and not facts. An example is that, there are a lot of landforms on Earth that looked like other living things, but they are not created by humans instead the land itself created it.

The Face on Mars was discovered around Cydonia on the red planet, so it is common to have another mesa around it. It is better to conclude an idea with facts and not

just some random guest, so the Face on Mars doesn't have much evidence that said it is made by aliens, but instead it has evidence that said it is created by the natural landforms if Mars. On April 8, 2001, MOC took a picture of the face close up and show it to everyone that the face doesn't really looked much of a face, but it looked like a hill that you can climb onto. According to MOC, the Face on Mars doesn't looked like a face, but ""a natural landform with no alien monument."" The picture that they took in the 1976 could have been an illusion since it was a cloudy time and the face was blocked with clouds and dust.

The picture that the Mars Global Surveyor took has shown that, there wasn't any objects of transportations, Egyptian pyramids or life on Mars that show that the Face was created by alien. People may keep assuming that the Face is created by aliens, but according to the author of Unmasking the Face on Mars, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West."" There are also other landforms that could have similar description of the Face that are found on other planets. The Face creation could have been created by a lava dome since according to the Garvin, the author of Unmasking the Face, the ""Miidle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho was a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars. Even though we know that the Face on Mars isn't created by aliens, there are other explanation that there could be life on Mars, but it the evidence that we have right now, strongly suggest that the Face on Mars is created by landforms.",4,1,0.9158820509910583
8b5367f,"Do you honestly think that from reading the article "" Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and from reading theories and looking at pictures of the face that it is a real face? Honestly people it is a natural landfrom. If you look at the three pictures taken in the years 1976,1998, and 2001 you see that it is very blurry at first, but then throughout the years you get a better look at it. As the years go on the ""face"" loses its shape and doesn't look much like a face anymore. The landform is cracking and it looks from the sky like a mound.

My first reason I think that the face is just a landform is that the way it is indented, it could be a mountain or a tall hill. If so, then you could see how between the years 1998 and 2001 the face could have had an avalanch or a simailiar situation happen to it. Cracks form and it looks like by 2001 the left side of the face has a huge indentation in it. If you look closely in the 2001 image taken from the spaceship ""Viking 1""

if you look at the outline of the face's shape, you will see how it kind of slants up like a slide. That is reason to beleive that the Face could be a hill, or a mountain or even a small or large mound.

Okay so econdly, do you believe in god? If you do then did you ever think that since god created everything, that he might have created this so we could study off of it and learn scientific facts. He could have put it there so we can study it and learn and eduacationally grow smarter with this. Another scenario is he put it there so people who want to be scientists or astronauts, that they could see this out in space and have a deeper curiosity for the thin they love and are interested in, whether that is space, or landforms or astrophysics. You never know it could happen.

I can see how you might think that this face structure is not a natural landform. You never know it could be a mound put there covering dead bodies. I know it sounds gross, but think if there is or was another species out there living on mars. Aliens or extra terrestrial creatures could have buried important objects or heirlooms to them there or have buried family or other creatures who have passed on there. You never know, but I can see why you might think that the face is not a natural landform. If I think about it too much my curiosity is kind of wanting to believe all of the unknown stuff such as history or mysteries unknown and veiled by this ""face"" object.

It could be a landform of mysterious identity. It could be a mound of buried treasure or bodies. We may never know. As it says in the passage,"" An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called Cydonia"" [1] This face object may just be there to arise our curiosity.

I have to ask more question about that too and they said that face look like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyrmaids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. Some of them don't believe it because they don't see it and they just guess that answer. But when I looked at the picture I think I saw that crown and their face look shiney and in 2001 that face look destroy . I don't believe in aliens but if there was some aliens in that planet they might made that face too and they hid away from that face. I wish I see that picture for real and take some picture and prove it.",1,1,0.8292144536972046
8b96e59,"Summary

The ""Face on Mars"" was found during a search for a possible landing site for the sister ship of Viking 1,

Pictures were taken during the search, a showy likeness of a human face was spotted.

An enourmous head close to two miles from end to end, was looking back at the camera.

Scientists believed it was just another Martian mesa, common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. But it had unusual shadows that made it look similar to an Egypt Pharaoh.

The ""Face on Mars"" is a huge rock formation, which resembles a human head.

Shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and because of this, it caused alot of attention to Mars. People believe that it was an alien monument, but proof showed that it was, just a natural landform.

Argumentative Essay

Few Scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact.

Photographing Cydonia and the Face became a priorty for NASA.

Eighteen years after the Viking missions ended, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos in 1976.

Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. To no surprise at all, revealed . . . a natural landform. No alien monument after all, Just rocks.

When the photo was taken it was winter in April '98. A cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to look through wispy clouds to see the Face, skeptics believe that because of this the alien markings were hidden. As said in the article

""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.""

The pixels in the 2001 image spans to 1.56 meters.

While the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel.

In a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, if there were objects on the ground in this picture, you could see what they were just by looking at it.

The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, commonly found around the American West.

""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" ",1,1,0.88005530834198
8bb7ea1,"Have you ever wondered about the Face on Mars? You probably told yourself it wasn't real, or you're one of those people who have done their research and love the idea of it being real. Well, I'm here today to tell you how it's not created by aliens. Aliens don't exist to our knowledge yet, so therefore we cannot assume that it was made by them.

First, as we refer back to the 2001 picture, it looks cracked and it looks like it was covered. In the 1998 picture, it looked like it was somewhat burning. In the 1976 Viking 1 picture towards the middle of the article, it shows the shadows, making it look like a human face. The eye was caused because of a hole, so it was dark. The nose was caused by the shadow on the right half of the face.

Then, NASA knew it was going to get popular very fast, and it did. It was a pop icon all over the world. For example, ""It had starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" (5). That goes to show NASA was in it for more fame, because who doesn't want to see a face on Mars?

Finally, it's just a natural landform! As the article states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image appeared first on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform"" (7). You shouldn't always believe what you hear. It wasn't (an) alien(s) who made it. It was a natural landform with a few shadows on it, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

The Face on Mars wasn't made by aliens. The pictures show it. NASA also just wanted to get popular off of it, because they know how us people are. We'd die to believe anything is true. It's also just a natural landform. Why would you believe what other people say? Why would you let others make you believe soemthing, why don't you just believe what you want to?",4,1,0.8423519134521484
8c1c2c0,"Yes, there is a Face on Mars and some people say The Face was created by aliens, but that statement is not true aliens did not created The Face. In fact it is just a natural landform. This landform was actually a lava dome that just got shaped funny when the lava got hard enough to stay the same for the rest of time, unless something happened really bad on Mars. We can state the fact that aliens did not build The Face because we have used the best camera and seen that there is no evindence that aliens build The Face. It is just like something we would see on earth it just happened naturally like how the Grand Canyon got on earth no human or alien built the Grand Canyon. It is just a natural thing that had happened just like The Face on Mars. In the picture that

NASA took has been zoomed into and the zoom would have picked up anything that was on the ground and there was not anything that showed that aliens or anything had build The Face there was absolutly nothing around the face that the aliens could have even used to build The Face out of. Therefore The Face was in fact not build by aliens. The Face is just a natural appering thing on Mars and there is no sign of anyone or anything building The Face on Mars excepcially not aliens. ",3,1,0.9016743898391724
8c7ca7b,"The Face of Mars is not created by aliens, NASA's Viking 1's picture was only thought as "" made by aliens"" because of the shadows. In 2001 NASA took another picture of the Face on Mars, but with better resolution. It was proved that the Face was in fact just a natural landform in Mars, called a mesa. One reason this was not created by aliens was because the Face was found around Cydonia, a region in the Red Planet. A Martian mesa were common around Cydonia.

First of all, It only looked like a face because of the unsual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. Scientist from NASA even took picture of the Face more than 20 times already, and as the resolution got better; pictures of the Face got more clear, and one can see that it is just another landform in Mars that look like a landform on Earth. Scientists already proved that Mars was once just like Earth, which meant there were many different, odd shape landforms. Even in Earth there are a bunch of landform that look like something else, so this means that Mars will also have odd shape landform.

Secoundly, one can be fooled by everything they see, even sugar look like salt. The point is, the Face in 1976 does kind of look like an Eqyptian Pharaoh but in the picture taken in 2001 showed that it look like a common landform from the American West. Just because it look like a Face does not means it was created by an alien life form. Currently there is no prove that alien life form even exists, if NASA ever found of about alien life form, the news will leaked out and the public will be able to see it. Do not be decieved, you can not just make up random fact just so satisfied your curiousity, look at the facts more then make a guess on what might have happened.

With using common sense, one can see that it is just another landforms in Mars that look like Lanforms from Earth. One might be thinking ""NASA could jusy be lying to us, the government does not want us to find out about alien life form in the first place"" that might be true, but why would the government release this news out in the fist place if they didn't want the public to find out about any alien life form. In the article it even stated that a few days later after NASA sees this they release it out for the public to see.

NASA's scientist have already told the public about how they found new kind of landforms on Mars, so that's one reason to know that there will be more; that does not means that aliens created these ""monument"". There is currently no proof that alien exist or even if they created this Face on Mars. Currently saying, this is just another amazing landform found in Mars that is unique abotu Mars. It also looks like the Face have eyes and nose, but it is just and illusion created by the shadows.

In Conclusion, you can say that this is an amazing landform that is created by God. It was release because NASA thought it would be a good way to engage the publin and attract attention to Mars, which it did. It also make others believe in aliens more than they ever did. This was a win-win for both the public and the scientists. As technology advanced we can see more clearly that it is just a natural landform that exist in Mars. It also proves that Mars might just once be like Earth because of their landforms. Instead of Venus as Earth twin's sister, Mars and Earth are look alike than ever. Garvin, Mars Global Surveyor even said it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.",4,1,0.9073482751846313
8cbf347,"Some people might think that the Face photograph taken from 1976 is an alien artifact, an alien monument, or an Egyptian Pharaoh. However the Face is in fact a natural landform or a Martian Mesa. A Martian mesa is common around Cydonia or the Red Planet.

The evidence that the Face is a natural landform is because the Face was found around Red Planet or the Cydonia that commonly have Martian mesa . Even though the Martian mesa looks like a face, it is actually a giant rock formation ""which resembles a human head...formed by shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Also, when the Face was taken again on April 5,1998, by Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team with a ten times sharper camara compared to the origional Viking photos, it reveals that the Face was ""no alien monument after all."" Still, some doubt the picture of the Face because it was not in the right weather or angle. However, when Mars Global Surveyor took the picture of the face again at the right angle and weather, it revealed that the face was actually a Martian which is equivalent to a butte or mesa.

Some people might still think that the Face is an alien artifact, alien monument, or an Egyptian Pharaoh. However, the Mars Global Surveyor showed and provide evidence that the Face was a natural landform or a Martian Mesa that is common around the Red Planet. To sum it all up, the Face is a natural landform according to the evidence that the Mars Global Surveyor provided.        ",3,1,0.8606066107749939
8d3c254,"Many people think that the face are created by aliens. Myself thinking i dont think aliens are real. This face from Mars in 1976 is natural form from Earth. We're still researching on the real idea of what is may have came from in the pass years. Also, many says it may be a reflected or shadow from something. Other scientist conclude that it may be just rocks in a hug formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows or dust giving illusion of eyes, nose ,and mouth. They called it ""The Face on Mars."" Most of the commuication of it started in a Hollywood film. Appeared in books ,magazines, radio talk shows , even hauted grocery store checkoutlines for 25 years. I think theres just a rock with holes in the it , looking like a human face but no one will never know til someone takes the trip to find out. By many think it was aliens creating it, people just assummed that idea. Other scientist still today wonder what it really is or how was it really created. There may have been a ancient civilization on Mars years ago. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for research to post a better and good viewer of the Face on Mars. Im thinking , by revealing alot of research, taking pictures and not approving that the face isnt changed by the amount of days and years, that it may just be a natural landform and that theres no aliens monument after all. There will still be other thinking and having their own opinions about the Face on Mars. Everyone wont just be satisfied with one fact or option about the face. Still many and most scientist are till snapping camera shots of the face and posting them on the web. More and more people and scientist will have diiferent thoughts about it and the world will never know what is going and what is it really until someone actually observed face to face. In my opinion, I think by wasting time doing research on something so little that have been lasting for years, no one never had the time to really go observe the reality about the face. Doing this research and conclude things will never tell the people answers about what the face. ",2,1,0.881679356098175
8d625bf,"Why do you think the ""Face of Mars"" was made by aliens. I think it is just part of the landscape. I don't believe aliens created a ""human face"" on Mars. Idon't believe it because the mouth and eyes are fored by shadows and NASA is based off research and theorist are based off conspiracies.

First, the mouth and eyes are formed by shadows. You can see the face from a far, in the picture tooken in 1976. When the picture was taken up close in 2001, it just looks like a mesa or a butte. Up close on a pictures, taken in 1976-2001, doesn't look like a face. It looks more like a messa or butte.

Second, the NASA is based off research and the theorists are based off conspiracies. NASA have checked three or four times. Theorists only think they know. They were just guessing. Jim Garvi, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, says he looked and it was only a mesa.

Based on the evidence I have, I think the ""Face of Mars"" is apart of Mar's landscape.    ",2,1,0.9062907099723816
8dbbb38,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" in NASA they are arguing and discussing what or who made the face. Some NASA people are thinking that the face was made naturaly. Others are saying that aliens used rocks and other things to create it.

The face on Mars is probaly naturally made because if you look at the images in the beginnig of the article, it has three different dates. If you look at the first one, 1976, you can see the face clearly. In 1998, the face is starting to get a little blery. Now at 2001, you barely see the face, in fact there is not a face anyone.

If this face was man-made or made by aliens, the shouldn't the face be more clearly in 1976. If man did make this face, how would they get there in the first place.

The face on Mars would be naturally made, cause no human or alien could make this.",2,1,0.8237837553024292
8dd4edf,"Today I am discussing the topic about the ""Face"".

I am discussing this topic with someone who thinks that it was created by aliens.

So today I am going to talk to him about it, and give him facts that it was indeed not greated by aliens.

That it is just a common landform that is on Mars.

One reason is that NASA would say if it was there.

We would tell people if it was really created by aliens.

We would tell people because, it would be very benifitial for NASA.

I mean NASA's budget wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

I there was why would we hide it. It would be one of the most greatest discoveries in NASA's history.

We could then really look into building a civilitation on Mars because, we would know that it has been done before.

We would want the world to know that NASA has found what once has been a civilization on Mars.

I not going to lie to you, it also would bring in alot of money for us.

Just like in the past it was a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appered in books, magazines, and radio talk shows.

We would want that all to happen again, so why wouldn't we tell.

Another reason is that we how such advanced tecnology now we would be able to see if there was an ancient civilization.

One example is the pictures that was taken of the ""Face"".

The camera that took the pictures spans 1.56 meters. So in the picture you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

The point is if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground, or Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you would be able to tell what they were.

My last reason is that you can compare the ""Face"" to common landforms on Earth.

It can be compared to something equivalent of a butte or mesa.

A butte or mesa are common landforms around the American West.

It can be compared to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

That is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mese, which is what probably happened on Mars, because they are about the same height.

So now you know my reasons why I think that the ""Face"" was not created by aliens.

Those reasons again are: NASA would tell becuase it would be benifitial to us, we have the tecnology to tell if something was there, and it can be compared to similar things on Earth.

NASA would want all of this to happen so why would we keep it all a secret?                                   ",3,1,0.8209288120269775
8de2ee2,"Pardon me, but i would like to disagree with you. What the picture acually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The Face on Mars is just a natural land form. The Face on Mars is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Just like we have many lanforms here on Earth, infact there is a lanform in Idaho. It is located in The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain, is what reminds me most of the Face on the planet Mars. We have more lanforms like the Face on Mars in the American West.

Conspiracy theorists say that the people of NASA are hiding the evidence of life on Mars. I mean think about about it, why would we hide evidence that would benefit this whole organization? Most of the people here at NASA wish that there was an early civilization on Mars. If we did find life on Mars we would share it world wide, it would be one of the greates scientic breakthroughs in history.

In paragraph 12 it states that what the picture shows is actually the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform, common around the American West, this statement is basically saying that there are many landforms that can look like faces or any type of other iiregular feature.

In paragraph 7, it explains how Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a much better picture than the origianal Viking photo. When Michael Malin and his camera team snapped the photo it revealed a natural landform, giving proof that there was no alien moument at all. And with that being done, it gives us even better reason to believe that it is just the way the ground looks.

The last two paragraphs in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" are most likely indicating that things can look different up close and also, from a distance. As I said in paragraph 1, paragraph 12 even states that landforms like that are common around the American West Meaning, that there could be a landform anywhere that looks like an alien, a martian or even an egyptian god!

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over this red planet. The MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed a natural landform. This concluded that there was no alien monument on Mars.

But many theorists, like yourself, stayed unconvinced. Again on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. This time the photo was taken by Malin's team, and they used the camera's maximum resloution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. The image taken actually portrays a Martian version of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

I as a scientist believe that Mars came from the atmistsphere and the many things that hang around in space or maybe it came from the sun or another planet. ''I can asure you aliens built this planet''! Do you have proof? ''Well I saw a picture''. Explain to me what the picture appeared to be.''It was a ''huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human mouth.''

It may have looked as if it were a face but that does not mean in anyway shape or form that it was an aliens creation. People often say things like this to be heard or recognized and it works. So of course you will hear things like this but you have to take it into your own hands as well as NASA did. I am a scientist and i do not know everything but, aliens sound outregeous. I still have to do some researching too but, I will figure it out.

The ''Face of Mars'' became a pop icon.''It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted a grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!'' Now as I told you , people say these things to be noticed but only an intelligent person would really look over it before speaking on it. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Finally we found out that there was no alien monument after all , after flying over to Mars to take pictures.

8e69430,"The Face, is it a natural landform or actual life on the planet Mars? In this argument I believe that the Face on the planet Mars is not alien life, but is a natural landform that has formed over periods of time.

I believe that the Face is a natural landform because of the information from the text.

Starting of on May 24, 2001 when the Viking 1 space craft found the face when it was searching for an area for its sister Viking 2 to land.

In 1976, the Face was not that clear at the time until 1998 when it started to take more shape.

I believe that if it was not a natural landform, NASA would have probably kept quite about it until they offically knew that it was or was not a natural landform.

Just because when it came, people are statring to think that the Face is ""bone fide evidence of life on Mars.""

If there was life on Mars, people all around the world would know about the it, and possibly would try to travel to Mars to see such life forms.

Yet know has tried, we humans have only sent robots to do the work on Mars for us.

On April 8, 2001 when they took the picture the second time, they have recievced a photo that they could compare to the picture that the Viking 1 took in 1976.

I believe that it is just a landform because the qoute from Garvin when he said ""It reminds me nost of Middle Butte in thr Snake River Plin of Idaho"" so it must just be a landform creation when it can remind some on of an experience the already seen.

In closing, from the facts from the story I believe that the Face is not alien life, but it is a natural landform that has been created over time.                                    ",3,1,0.8898302316665649

Come on people, you have got to get over the possibility of life on mars, we have been searching for forty years now.

First thing is, it is just a mesa on Mars. The shadows on it and the concaves give off the optical illusion that it is a face. There is no life on Mars, therefore there is no way it could be artificial. ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their moniters. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cynodia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh.""

(P. 11) This excerpt shows that with a camera as such a high grade as this one that there was barely anyhting on Mars surface that could be hidden.

While there is the smallest chance of the consiracy theorist being correct about the structure being artificially constructed and such, NASA would let this out. Let's go ahead and assume the theorist are correct. Spot on. NASA has been cut off by the government and has to pay for all of their journeys. NASA would bring this to the public in the hopes of getting funds and people wanting to work there for the future that could be.

People have got to get over the possibility of life on Mars, even if it was there it is probably as small as bacteria this moment.

Of all the things you could've said, you said aliens.

There's more proof that it is just a formation other than an alien.

Your mind will change after you read this.

By the way, do you realize that the ""Face of Mars"" is a pop star?

First off, there is no trace of aliens on the planet.

NASA has been saying for years that it wasn't aliens that did it.

Why would NASA lie to the whole world?

Also, why would aliens make a human face?

It is just a huge rock formation that resembles a human head and that has been proven.

These kinds of thoughts always happen because of the media.

They always make something different from what it really is.

Now a lot of people think that NASA is keeping information from them, and that there is life on mars.

Whenever the media gets the chance to say something about aliens, they always take that chance.

Why do you people listen to everything you see or hear?

Isn't it dumb to think alien exists?

Let's be honest, what real proof do we have of aliens?

The fact the huge rock formation looks like a human face is just a coincidence.

Just because something has to do with space, doesn't mean aliens have to be a part of it.

Aliens are not in space so deal with it.

Sorry to upset you but we have to face facts.

Also if there were aliens, it would be best if the world didn't know.

But there are no aliens so we don't have to worry about that.

Face the facts because they don't exist.

Don't be a media follower because they are full with false rumors.                                                                                                      ",3,1,0.7535603046417236

""This mask is not made from aliens. This was a natural landform that created it self. There was nothing there that shows some life form lived there."" I said.

""The thing that made it could have not been seen on your pictures."" said the enthusiast.

""The machine we used to take the pictures, its pixels spans 1.56 meters. Once you saw them, you could zoom in on them. If there were any life forms on Mars, we would have seen it. Taking the pictures wasn't easy, You had to find the face first and then be able to take a picture. When we finally got the picture, it is more then likely that the cameras didn't mess up. Besides, what kind of thing would be able to create such a face?""

""You never know what's out there.""

""Yes, we do, and we have no evidence of any living creautures on that planet. Therefore, it was made naturally.""

The guy I talked to later became a beleiver that the face was a natural landform. He also got a job at NASA and devoted his job on finding out how the face was made.

NASA and we has been seeing a figure that looks like a humans head, but I don't like it's that, i think that it is a lanform. The nose could bumps from if people dumped things there or it could be bumps. The eyes could again be waste that people dumped and it formed into bumps or the nose and eyes could be hills on the face.

I also think that the face could be landforms because they are common around the American West and it looks like from the front it looks like a circle but if you look at it from the side it looks like a rectangle. The face could be a landform because we ended up revealing that it was infact a landform.

I belive that the face is a landform because of the shape on the bottom and because from all the pictures we gathered when we put them together they look like a landform, just because the things that look like eyes and a nose doen't mean that it could be an alien, the landform could have bumps or hills that formed from people dumping waste on it or from having hills on it, or it could be dents on it from things stepping, walking, or things falling on it.

8f24354,"The Universe is an intruging and undefined place that we have begun to understand. Although we have started the search of other planets, there remains a plethora of information that is still undiscovered. Existing life forms have not yet been proven true on any other planet besides our own, Earth. Based on evidence and scientific understanding of the world we live in, the Face on Mars is a structure created by random chance.

Pictures taken on other planets, including Mars, only tell us to a certain extent what the planet is like. Rock, dust, and crater formations are seen in many areas of planets. Just as with Earth, other planets change throughout time from asteroid collisions, internal movement, and natural occurences. From the era in which we live in, we can only know so much about the planet Mars itself. Just as well, full scale space exploration has only recently become possible with innovation and technology of our society. As seen in paragraph seven, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" This proves to us that new additions to technology have been made in a short time period, from 1976 to 1998, twenty-two years. We can see from this that everything, with a second, more detailed look can change.

In addition to technological improvements and understanding of the universe, our belief in social media and public news is phenominal. We trust in almost everything that news reporters, magazines, websites, and spreading word tells us. Rumors and false reports spread quickly and in a wide range. Also, expounding on existing rumors happens often. When the public heard of the Face on Mars, word of aliens and other beings existing on Mars dispersed through the people of Earth. Many people had believed that NASA was keeping such information in secrecy from the media. As public interest peaked, NASA was persuaded to investigate the landform on Mars once again. The public interest can be seen in paragraph five, ""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" This shows us that our belief in public reports is true. We believe in what media and others tell us, not always specifically what the source, in this case, NASA tells us.

Lastly, NASA researchers are professionals who work with outerspace accounts everyday. It is more plausible to believe in what they tell us rather than what others tell us. As concluded in NASA's research it is seen in further pictures that the Face on Mars is just a landform. There is no extraterestrial link with picture or Mars.

In Conclusion, Pictures and technology back when the original, Face on Mars, was seen is old and outdated. Newer technology proves to us that the picture just happens to be by coincidence and chance. Social media may spread rumors or false reports and should not always be believed. Public attention should be given directly to the source in which the information has come from. Therefore, NASA's research and conclusions should be of our most interest and paramount importance. The Face on Mars is not of alien origin and is simply just a landform created by chance.

We know that it is just a landform because we see them all the time here on planet earth. It is the same thing on Mars too. When we went in April in the year of 1998 it was winter of there. Which is a time for cloudy days. When we went The camara on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the so called face. We could have easily mistaken the shadows of the clouds for eyes, nose, and mouth like shapes. It could also maybe just have dents and or holes in the landform. It probabbly is just a level hill with a few holes or dents that would make it look like a a faceof a human. But we know its not a human face because how would people know whatwe look like. If they would look like us they would more then likely function like us too. So that would mean we clearly could go to mars too. But we can not so clearly no human like creature would make this.

Some people still believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is the work of aliens. I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is not the work of aliens, but a natural landform.

The article gives good evidence that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another weird natural landform on Mars. In paragraph 5, conspiracy theorists claim the ""Face on Mars"" is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide. In paragraph 3, NASA unveiled the image for all to see in 1976. The caption noted, ""a huge rock formation...which resembles the shape of a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars; which it certainly did just that. The authors of the article wanted to attract attention towards Mars and NASA even claimed that it was a huge rock formation in the caption. Later, stating that shadows gave the huge rock formation the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper and clearer than the original Viking photos. The picture taken in April of 1998, would most likely not have shadows to give illusions of the face, nose, and mouth. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

Here again we can see NASA trying to prove that the ""Face on Mars"" in still just a weird natural landform on Mars. Someone who stills believes that the ""Face on Mars"" is the work of aliens might say something like this. The ""Face on Mars"" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps alien markings were by haze, skeptics claim. However, that was back in April of 1998, and the most recent photo taken was back in 2001. The photo taken in April 2001, the weather was perfect-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The photo taken that year still looks like a natural landform on Mars.

The excellent reasons stated above prove yet again that the so called ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform. NASA has clearly proven that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another strange landform on Mars. ",5,1,0.8815277814865112
8f6429a,"Many people are thinking that the ""face"" on Mars is an actual face, or they say it was created by aliens. It was proven very well that it is not an actual face. One it is an rock, two the angle the camera was at cought the shadow of it so it seemed as if it was a face, and three the only reason it was told to be a face was for marketing.

My first reason was because it is a rock on mars. It states in paragraph three that it is a huge rock in formation of a human head. therefore that is one reason it is showing everyone that it is just a rock. The rock over the years has wathered down and it has more crevisises and it is losing the foerm of a face. If there was an actual face barryed under there it would never really lose its true form.

My second reason is that the angle of the camera was so that you can see the shadow and if they just wouldve gotten a better angle you woyld be able to see that there was nothing really there. If you were too also look at othere surroundings you would be able to see that there are many other masas on Mars. It also states that it may have been the pixles in the cameras. If we had the technology we have now when they first found it you would most likely have a better picture of it and be able to see what it actually looked like.

My final reason for it not being a face is that the only reason they continued on the theory of it being a face because they wanted good marketing. So itr seemed as if they kept the theory continued because they wanted to have marketing for NASA. Obviously it worked, because the story stated that they started to have hollywood film it appeared in books, magazines, and even raido talks.

Thoes are my reasonings that the ""face"" on Mars is actually just a rock. It was proven to be just another one of the many rocks on mars, the angle of the camera could've been off, the kept the theory going just for marketing.      ",4,1,0.9001522064208984

Many people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. The Face on Mars was not created by aliens due to it's common landform shade.

Mars Global Surveyor was used to take pictures of Mars. The picture showed the Face was the equivalent to the size of a butte or mesa. Butte or mesas are common landforms around the American West. A famous one is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Martain mesas are very common around Cydonia. Cydonia is a region of Mars. It is not uncommon for a rock formation to resemble something like a face. The shadows on Cydonia gave the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth on the natural rock formation.

People who support that the Face was created by aliens believe that there is life on Mars and that NASA is hiding this information. This is not true. NASA wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Life on Mars would be great business for NASA and they would have no reason to hide it from the public.

The first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Eighteen years later, Mars Global Surveyor landed on the Red Planet. The technonlogy was way more advanced now. The NASA scientists were able to get a picture ten times sharper that the orginal Viking photo. This proved to the thousands of waiting web sufers that the Face was a natural landform.

NASA realeased this picture to the public saying that this was not a face on Mars only a mesa. This attracted the publics attention and it became a huge pop icon that appeared in books,magazinse,radio talk shows,and even in grocery store isles for Twenty-Five years.

Maybe there was once aliens, but the facts just don't prove that to be true, therefore it is indeed just a natural landform.

The picture clearly shows that this formation could not possibly be that of alien descent. Scientists have proved on three different occasions that it is merely another isolated Martian mesa, which was common in the area Cydonia.

Scientist's have proven that this famous face from magazines and once starred in a hollywood film is just a natural landform in a region of mar's called Cydonia.

This face is just a natural landform and how we know its a natural landform is because the article states, "" It's just a huge rock fromation, Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"". It's not an alien monument It's just a natural landform on mar's.

So that is why this iconic face of the 1970's and 80's is just part of the planet mar's itself and wasn't put there by another living speicies on mar's like aliens It's just some shadow's that come together a little bit to give the illusion of eye's, a nose, and a mouth in the region of Cydonia.

9055d9f,"Since 1976 people have been in awe of the mysterious ""Face on Mars"". It has been discussed in films, books, magazines, and talk shows. Some people even believe that it was formed by martians thousands of years ago as a monument, but recently scientists have disproved this theory almost entirely.

One of the reasons this theory is faulty is that the face was just a butte similar to one that can we see here on Earth. We have designed telescopes to discover if this was true or not and we found out that yes, it is just a natural landform on Mars. The shadows happend to be in the right place when the telescope had passed over the butte which caused it to seem as if it was a face. Concpiracy theorists could say that the martians merely just tampered with the sun or Mars so that the shadows would align every so often, but this is just speculation. This leads me to my next point.

The topic of martians has been a big one since the mid-1900s. We have dicovered many things about Mars since then and no evidence has pointed toward there being life on the planet. Scientists have although, discovered flowing water near the polar caps on Mars's surface. But even if there is enough water, lifeforms can not merely live off of it alone. Organisms need nutritious food to survive. Plants could not even live there because of the soil's lack of sufficient nutrients and it's harmful toxins it has. Besides, Mars is so far away from the sun that the plants would take almost twice as long to grow. Without the ability to have any food, the martians -if there were any (which I have already discussed)- would have died in the beginning of thier lifetime. Now you could say that they could be cannibals. This is just simply not right because if they were, they would have all died off before they could begin to work on the monument on Mars or even discover the technology to build it.

This battle of whether the ""Face on Mars"" was made by martians or not could go on forever even if we discover more about it. Who knows, the theorist could come up with some evidence later. But in the end, theorists are just theorist after all. They are just speculating even if the whole world knows what is fact. ",3,1,0.8389203548431396

If aliens were real don't you think they would have came down to Earth and taken over? I mean they probably have the power to do it. If natural landforms can be created on earth why can't they be created on Mars?

It was even said by Garvin that it reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It was probably just a mistake that happened when something ran into it. Just cause it looks like aliens did it doesn't mean they did. It is possible for a human to do it. But when there are no such things as aliens it just means that something ran into it. There are all kinds of thing flying around in space. He/she needs to think of the logical side and realize that something just ran into it

I was surprised when i heard about the face. There may have been an acient civilization on Mars and we just don't know about it. We didn't have telescopes that would see that far until i don't know when. But when the dinosaurs were around there could have been an acient civilization. And isn't Mars the planet that has the most wind? Maybe we can't find anything that they left behind cause the wind may had blown it away.

Now people are going to start saying that the Ancient Civilization was aliens. But it could have been people that, after the dinosaurs, died moved here. Some people believe God made us by the sand of the earth. And some believe that we evolved from monkys. But no-one knows for sure. Our ancestors could have been living on Mars and we moved here cause this place is better. We haven't found anything that would support my theory but it is possible. Maybe they burned all the documents so we wouldn't know the truth. And science always says that creatures adapt to their new enviroments, so why can't we. Most likely we created that on accident and we left it when we moved here

Some people may disagree with me and some may agree with me. But i have my theories and they have theirs. My theory may be wrong, but that doesn't stop me from believing it. Their theory is probably wrong, but i don't know that. They could be right and i could be wrong. Or I could be right and

they could be wrong. But i have some really good points. Aliens aren't real. We could have created that and left it their. We could have originally been from Mars. Who knows? Because I certainly don't.",3,1,0.8154918551445007
90db3bf,"How is there a face on Mars? Was it created by natural landfroms or was it created by aliens? Well according to information in the passage, it says that the Face was created by natural landforms. In paragraph 7,

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field view,"" said Garvin. When we took that second look, that's when we knew that the Face was created by natural landforms.

To explain to the scientists that believed the Face was an alien artifact, you are incorrect. The Face was created by natural landforms. As the scientists who believed that the Face was created by natural landforms, we did our research and proved the scientists who believed that the Face was an alien artifact wrong. To state my claim that the Face was created by natural landforms, is that the picture actually shows that the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Therefore shows that the Face was created by natural landforms.",2,1,0.8925018906593323
90e7cdf,"In this passage there is a debate on a 'human faced rock formation""

whether it's a natural landform or a alien artifact. Many believed alien markings were hidden by haze. While others believed it was a natural landform based on evidence. Scientists have alot of evidence that the human face rock is just a landform. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size"" meaning if there was any type of alien life form on Mars then the digital images would show some type of evidence of it.

Instead, scientists just keep finding evidence and taking pictures that points everything about the human faced rock back to a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is loacted 41 degrees North martian latitiude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. In regards to that the picture actually shows the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa. Trying to convince someone to believe what scientists say i wold bring out alot of information about the human faced rock showing it's just a landform by telling that person scientists figured it was just a martain mesa, common around

Cydonia. Many say the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.

With many saying NASA would rather hide conspiracy theories, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization. Althougth few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact photographing cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived on the Red planet. While eveyone was waiting for a picture of the face and it was revealed it showe no alien monument after all. Mission controllers prepared to look again ""it's not easy to target cydonia"" saif Garvin. In conclusion all evidence scientists are collecting about this human faced rock all comes out to be just a natural landform.",3,1,0.8786327838897705
90ea4f5,"In the article ""Umasking the Face on Mars"", there are diffrent theories on what exactly they think this is. The logical answer is that the face is just a natural landfrom the article states not logical reasons and conspiracy theories not provided from NASA, they have done their research.

During the article it provides pictures varying in dates from 1976, 1998 and 2001. Over these years it begins to form and show more. Its classified that it really is just a mesa. Different research and other many pieces of evidence back up this statement. It is just a natural landfrom.

Twenty five years ago when the viking 1 was out it spotted the likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles end to end. They unveiled it as a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. Others refused to belive this and insisted that the NASA had to be covering up something, even though they provided all the research and more than needed.

The ""Face on Mars"" attracted films, books, magazines, radio talks. Some people still thought the face of it being something else was something they would rather hide than bring to the public eye. Even though they had all the facts and research to back up their theory of exactly what it was. Which was a natural landform thats all. People say it even looks like some other landforms they've seen or come across.

The face that was found on mars was accused of being many things and an amazing finding. To this day im sure there are still disputes over what it actually was or is. Although it was proven, not to be a face or an alien artifact. It was just a land formation that took place or just a rock formation. It was a natural landform.",3,1,0.8920230865478516
90fe430,"The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" had many people talking and asking if there was alien life on another planet. Obviously that is not true because they had pictures that it was just a landform,it could have been a rock, and this has happened before, it is very common. The ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" does not prove that there is another life on Mars.

First of all, the face is a natural landform, a picture is proof of it being a landform. They also took pictures of the so called face and determined that it was a landform. In the passage it says "" When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

The picture was the proof in the pudding. Therefore there was not alien monument.

Secondly, this face on mars could be a rock. The world has seen many of weird shaped rocks to consider that the face was a weirdly shaped rock. In the passage it says "" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" The thing about rocks are that they can come from anywhere, can be found anywhere, can look like anything, and can be anything. Therefore it is a rock, a weirdly shaped one.

Thirdly, it is common to find things like this. In the passages it says, ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" There was many other reasoning for this rock other than thinking that there was life on another planet. Therefore it is common it happens all the time.

Although people say that there is another life on Mars, so far there is not. There is proof with pictures, it is just another lanadform like a rock , and it is very common to find these things. To conclude, maybe one day they will discover life on another planet, but this was a false alarm.    ",4,1,0.8964333534240723
915416d,"I believe the face is just a natural landform because its not possible for a planet to have a face. I feel that NASA just wants the public's attention, yea they have pictures but with technology now anything can look how you want it to. Pictures can be very decieving and these pictures don't look quite real. In the article it not everyone was satisfied, that's because noone really believed it. Not many people really even believes in aliens so why would they believe that markings have been left behind by them.

Im sure that Mars is just having a few natural changes because its so old. Also the article explains that they have a digital camera that makes thing three times bigger than pixel size meaning that this ""Face"" doesn't quite look like a face without this effect on it. And so what if it did look like a face that doesn't mean that there's life on this planet. Its just having a natural change after many years, that's why NASA is waiting years to go back to get another picture, because its changing in those years.

Maybe its just that I'm the type that has to see things for myself in person to be able to believe but as far as the little information they have on this planet I will never believe this. See in the first few pictures what looks like what's happening is the ground is slightly erupting which makes it forms oddly. Just coincidently it happens to look like a face.The 2001 picure honestly didn'tlook like a face. So that's partly why I feel its just a natural change on Mars.",2,1,0.8682484030723572
91680e1,"Mars the red planet is our next destination for the human race and we want to find out as much as we can about it before fully exploring it. Something interesting has occured and many people think that it's the work of aliens. Why would aliens want to buid a giant face? Is it really the work of aliens or just a natual landform? I'll tell you why it's just a natural landform and not an ancient Egyptian-like pyramid.

With the recent photographs of the so called ""face"" it has become clear to me that it is just a natural landform as seen in the picture taken in 2001. The phoograph shows that the mesa is made from the same dirt as the dirt around it. If aliens wanted to buid shelter, wouldn't they want to buid something more sturdy? Also wouldn't there be a quarry of some sort to get the resorces to build that thing? It is just a natual landform just like the ones you would see on Earth.

As said in the article, the time of year that the photo was taken was during a cloudy time of year so that could have made the photo blurry and harder to see thus making the mesa look like a face. Garvin even says that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Mars is a cold desert planet with very little atmosphere or resources. There have been signs of water on Mars but that is long since gone. If there was life on Mars it's long gone but it is very unlikely for life to have ever existed there.

Space harbors mysteries and we as humans have a desire to uncover them. When something wierd happens (the face) we get to work in uncovering what it really is. There really is only one way to find out what it is for certain; we have to go there and see for ourselves which will bring up more and more questions about space.",4,1,0.8098998069763184

''I dont know how that got there, but i'm telling you now it wasn't made by aliens.''

As you can see the three different photos showing the figure on mars was just a misunderstanding. In the 1976 photo it looks blury, but in 1998 and 2001 photos you can see it more cleary. In the article it states '' The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face.'' So that means the clouds made it look like a face.

Also during 1976 the pixels on the camera could have been bad so it could't take clear pictures. In the image 3 it shows it more clearly, so that means technology has gotten better. According to the article it says ''Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That proves that the camera in 2001 was better then the camera in 1976.

Nobody will ever know if aliens made that figure on mars that looks like a face.

It could have been a butte or a mesa. For example in the passage it states ''There must have beem a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

919ecf5,"The statement that has been gooing around stating ""the face on Mars was created by aliens."" The statement is false, the face you have seen on mars is a natural landform. The photos you have seen was a hill developing in the process over time. We have taken a photo of the strange spot on the planet Mars and it has been reported,that it is a natural landform.

We did not have the same technology as what we have had in the past. When we first took the picture we did not have the same technology so we had a blurry picture. But when we have our technology now, we have better cameras so that we can get a better image of the big red planet called Mars. We have no proof that aliens have built this face in the surface on mars. This face you see on the planet is just a landform.

The face you might see in the photograph is just a mind illusion that you might see a face. the face you see is a hill that has been formed by the ways of the planet its self. It might have been molding from the dust and the wind dragging the red sand and dirt off of the hill its self.

We have no way or knowledge to know that aliens have built this face on the hill. The face has been forming for probably thousands and thousands of years. We think the forming on mars, like craters and hole in the ground, plus the face is just a natural landform forming on the crust of mars its self. How would we know if other forms of life built this face?...We dont know because we do not have that much knowledge about the space. There are infifnity of space out their that we have not explored yet so how would we know if the aliens have built this.

The thought of this statement that aliens have built this face in the crust of mars is ludicris. The face on mars has been formed by natural landformings in the crust of Mars. The theory of aliens made the face is as dumb as a bump on a log.        ",3,1,0.8955171704292297
9211106,"Many scientists working for NASA, as well as myself, have found, and taken pictures of a natural landform on Mars that resembles a face. We have discovered a very unique landform. Some people, like you, believe that the face is some form of an alien monument. I do not believe that this is a claim that can be supported, nor is it a true claim, but I can see where your ideas come from.

The scientists I work with, along with myself, believe that this is definantly just a natural landform on Mars. When the pictures first came from the Viking 1 spacecraft, we were suprised, but that didn´t last long. We realized that this is just another Martian mesa. We realized that the only reason why this landform looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh was because of the unusual shadowing. Taking another picture of the face was necessary to us when MGS arrived at Mars in 1997. When the MGS flew over the face it took another picture that was much better than those that the Viking 1 took. This picture really proved to us that this was just a natural landform. Since that day was cloudy, some people didn´t believe that the picture was sufficient. In 2001, we got yet another picture that proved to us that this was just another natural landform. With the technology and the camera used to take the picture, if there were small shacks near ""the Face"" or unusual markings on ""the Face"" we would have been able to see them. There was no actual markings or Egyptian-style pyramids near or on the face, so we decided it is just a natural landform similar to Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

When we first found this face I could see where you were coming from about thinking it is an alien monument. You may think that it could be something they worship, or it just represents something like our statues do. You may also think that NASA scientists, like me, just don´t want to share about the fact that there might be alien life-forms, but I think that if we knew anything about that we would want to share and profit off of it. Also this is not an alien monument because if we thought that it was, we would want to explore it more and get it out to the public, but we´re not. This should probably give you and your fellow believers about it being an alien monument a clue that it really is just a landform.

So, in conclusion, this natural landform that looks like a face is simply just a natural landform similar to what we have on Earth. Aliens did not create this to resemble a face, it is just a result of shadowing on the landform. ",5,1,0.904217004776001

Then when they put that photo out of the face on mars people were using it in haunted grocery stores checkout lines, radio talk shows, magazines, books, and hollywood films.

Then even some scientists belived that they face was an alien artifact so when people did not belive them they went and took more picture of the face but it was mars cloudy day and people still did not belive them. So NASA went back for another one but to get a better picture they had to get closer to the face and role the ship twenty five degrees to the center they also had to go over the face very often because it was hard to get the picture.

The spaceship would look over mars like a faxing machine but lucky for them going around the face very often it got to a point to were their was no clouds and they were able to get a good shot of the face. So NASA was able to get a better picture of the face so that people would belive them that it was a face in the surface on mars.

The face was not accutally formed from the viking 2 but from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on the moon.

Yes, I understand it's' a planet we haven't been on yet don't you get that, they could have perfectly normal things just like the Earth that happen every day. Do you understand now?

No?, well on April 5, 1998, when Mars GLobal Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time and the MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharer than the origina Viking photos. It is a real landform that was caused by natural things that happen, it was no alien monument. It is very hard to get to the face in space because our teams have to go different places, we have to look at different things.

I see your point of view though, I get that MOC could have gotten the picture wrong, but you see it was ten times as sharper than it had been years before. Yes, it was cloudy to and that could have caused some major differnces comapred to when it is sunny. The ""alien markings could have been hidden by haze"", you never know though, but we don't make it over the face very often, it's hard to get a better view from it.

The picture could have been photoshopped to make it look different, I know its in the late ninety's but it wen tto a Jet Propulsion Lab where the face started to apppear into a face. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common arounf Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharoh.

Many scientists believed it was important to NASA and very few believed it was an alien artifact, after eighteen long years the Vikining mission was over.

Do you believe me now when I say that aliens didn't create this face on Mars? It is very posible that they did but, not very likely that they did. You have to look at the facts that it might actually be a natural landform, this argument could go either way but again look at the facts and how we got a ten times sharper look at it and how Mars works, it could work the same as Earth and we don't consider Earth to have aliens on it, we don't blame aliens on our land features.

Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform. I'll explain my thinking as me being a scientist at NASA.

My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible.

My second reason is that they photographed the face. Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head. My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos! When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, it clearly revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien . these three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head.

In 1976, there was barely anything to be classified that their was even a face, even though it was forming by 1998. Three years later you can see a face clearly on Mars. Seems weird? Not really because it was later then noted a ''huge rock formation.'' The face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian a latitude where it was winter in April.

Therefore, the face actually shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. Landforms like that are pretty common around the American West. Facts over time has proven that it was just a landform that isolated messa about he same height as the Face on Mars.

Proven with pixels, in 2001 scientist took photos and compared it to the images in 1976. Also, April 5, 1998 the (MOC) team took some pictures revelaling that is just only a natural landform.

93f73be,"You may have thought the Face was created by aliens. It could be a possibility, but think of the research and observations of the scientists. You can't just predict something and think of a conclusion. You must go through a process of research and examinations. The scientists researched and examined the Face and was just another Martian mesa that was around Cydonia.

First of all, the image did have characteristics of a face. The text stated ""a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation..which resembles a human head....formed by shawdos giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" The Face could simply have been the shadow of something or the lighting that caused it to look that way. ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" The photograph from the Viking could have been a worse quality than now.

Secondly, the photograph that was captured in 1998 is more reliable and more efficient than the other one. This picture has a more clear view and is better to observe. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camer (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing....a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The landform could have been created from erosion or weathering or even different types of weather or climate. In fact, maybe a closer view could have looked a different shape.

Furthermore, there was another shot taken in 2001. With an even better camera quality, which showed different types of shapes or objects, other than a face. In the text it said ""On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.""

Garvin stated ""We had to roll the spacecrafts 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The pixels having a better quality made the observation even better. The camera could even make the objects 3 times bigger. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" They were trying to say that if it was created by aliens they could have been able to tell because of its texture or shape.

In conclusion, the Face was not created by aliens, it is just a natural landform. The Viking photo made it look like it was created by an alien because of its structure and the way it was formed and shaped and it was only because of the quality of the picture that made it seem like it was. With the more recent pictures and 10 times better quality made the scientists come to a conclusion that it was just a structure.

Day's at the Lab went by as any other day for the scientist's, not finding anything new up in space, just a few minor event's here and there, but nothing big. I went in my office, and was informed today we were going to try and find any possible landing site's for Viking 1's sister ship, Viking 2. As usual we went to work. Orbiting Mars for what seemed like an eternity! I'm literally bored out of my mind, until out of the corner of my eye I see something, not just a star or anything, but to my eyes looked like a human face staring right back at us through Viking 1.

Confusion is all us scientist's felt when we saw that face on Mars, just plain fear and confusion. Nothing was spoken much about it among us scientist's since we were all super shocked and speechless, that was until we were on our lunch break. All I heard was ""Alien's"", really alien's can they possibly pin this ""face"" on Aliens! The table next to me also seemed to think alien's made this Egyptian-type face. I dont know what came over me something just clicked and I said ""How can you possibly pin this on alien's?!"" of course this started a one-on-one argument with me and another scientist ""What do you mean, how can it not be Alien's"" he answered. ""First of all, it was spotted near Cydonia, a part of Mars where Martian Mesa's are commonly being found everyday, so how do we not know it isn't just another Mesa?"" ""If you think this is a mesa, how would it take form to look like a human being's face? Dont you think that is too much of a coincidence to happen?!"" at that I left it alone, maybe it was too much of a coincidence, but that wasn't going to affect my thought on the ""Mesa""

The word on the ""Face"" spreaded around the world, becoming a hot topic for people everywhere, most of them thinking it was made by Alien's. I didnt really get much into it until that scientist kid came up to me again, ""Still think it wasn't made by alien's?!"" ""Of course, why wouldn't I?"" ""How can you not think it was alien's! The picture became known to the world and everyone think's it was alien's, which they are probably right!!"" ""How can we know for sure this was created by alien's!? Think about it we dont have great technology yet, that ""Mesa"" was in the form of a face because our photo was too blurry and it was really cloudy!!"" I really didnt want to end up on the wrong foot with this guy so i just walked away.

April 5,1998- I walk into the office and apparently we are going to take a look at Cydonia for the ""Face"" again. This was actually a releif to me, because I know that now our technology is way more advanced and we could see with a sharper picture what this thing really is, a mesa. So it happened Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took a picture ten time's sharper than the old one! As to my conclusion, the egyptian face ended up to be a mesa! This mesa took form of a face because of the shadow's that went over the mesa.

9459254,"25 years ago, a NASA spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling Mars, taking pictures of landing sites that its sister spacecraft, Viking 2, could possibly use. While circling Mars, it snapped a photo of a landform that seemed to look similar to a human face. Thay called it the ""Face on Mars"", and it became hugely popular, making appearances in movies, books, radio talk shows, and even grocery store checkout lines in the form of magazine covers. Contrary to some popular belief, wasn't anything to do with aliens, and here's why.

The Face on Mars is what you would call the Martian equivalent of a mesa, a natural landform that is common in the American West. The scientists assumed so whenit first appeared on screen, but this particular mesa had shadows that made it look kind of like an Egyption Pharaoh. When releasing the images to the public, the author of the article made it sound like the eighth wonder of the world, trying to attract attention to Mars, and it worked.

The photographs that were first taken of the ""Face"" were very hazy, and many people believed that there were some sort of alien markings under all the fog. The truth is, they took amazing photos with maximum resolution on April 8th, 2001, and there were no markings, aircrafts, little structures, or pyramids to be seen anywhere. What the picture does show is that the ""Face"" is, in fact, a kind of butte or mesa on Mars. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Eploration program, said it reminded him of ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."". So, In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform that got a bunch of hype in the press.      ",3,1,0.9058331251144409
9468359,The face on Mars has a lot of people thinking there is life there but studies show there is no sign of life on Mars. The face on mars is very big so people dont really think it was made by aliens. Just because it big that doesnt make it made by aliens but in outer space there are a lot of astroides flying around so some of them may have hit a mound of rock to where it has made a face. People still want to believe that there is life out in space there could be but there are no studys to prove that there is life. In conclusion there is not lif on mars and that face could have been made naturally because how long has the face been there before we took the picture. There could have been someway that the face was formed. Look at Earth there are many formations that have been naturally made. There are other studies that the ice caps on Mars have tiny bugs in them.,2,1,0.8498257398605347
94bbf8d,"I am a scientist at NASA, and I am going to prove to you that NASA was not created by aliens, it is just a natural landform. Other scientists, including me was around Mars taking photos. We took a lot of photos and when we came back to check the photos it looked like a human face. I used a new method step by step to see if it actually was a human face, but it was not. It turned out to be a rock shaped as a head, and the rock made you have an illusion of the eyes, mouth, and nose.

To many people are concerned about aliens going to attack, but it is not true. Some scientists just want you to think there are aliens that based off what they have saw. If you look on a JPL web site you can see that it is just a natural landform. After all there was no alien monument. The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms.

According to what the theory is, another reason for it being a natural landform is because NASA would rather hide and the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Half of the time on photos things start to look like ghost or even aliens for this matter if you are scared and are thinking about aliens being alive or by you. The Face is a natural landform according to the mission controllers, where the lab is. Monitors will lok like a face when you first take it but you have to clear the picture up a little bit.

For the Face to seem natural to you, you have to believe that there is no aliens out on what people call bona fide, of life on Mars. You always want to make sure that you are not just having an illusion. To make sure you are not having an illusion you are checking what ever is happening twice. For an example of a natural landform, there would have to be pictures taken and on the natural landform there would have to be a mapping spacecraft and that normally looks straight down. For an example of a alien landform, there would be UFO's with bright lights shining and would have to have a hide out for them to live and to not be seen.

This is my evidence that I gathered from the method that I used to prove to you that the Face is just a natural landform. Yes, NASA does have a Mars but, that does not mean that there would be aliens, just because it says Mars. If you ever have need some help on getting a person to believe you about something like scientists wise, come to my website JPL and message me. Their are creatures but they are not on the Face of NASA. Do not ever forget if you take a picture and you think something is there try to clear it up or get someone else to clear it up.

After they found it few days later NSA said ""It's a huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head..formed by shadows gving illusion of eyes ,nose,and mouth."" If your not a sceincetist it sounds more realistic. Right? Next I'm going to tell more facts that it was not an alien that create the human face on mars.

When globa surveyor came in Sept. 1997 they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot of the face. Micheal Malin went to mars he took hs team and a camera that too ten times sharper than the orignal camera they took it with before. When they uploaded the picture all NSA found was landforms . Their is no such thing as aliens mountment. Some people were not impressed with this answer and cause it was located differntly in the winter time and alein maring might of been hidden by the haze. The MGS team even went out there again with a cloudless summer day and was 25 degrees in the center of the face and even used a different camera again and made it bigger and sharper. If there was any mountments or traces of aliens or space crafts you could obivously see it, but they did not find anything like that. NSA did find a lava dome that takes form of an isolated messa about the same height as the face on mars.

There is not any life on mars after all not even aliens. It as just a natural landform that freaked some people to thinking their are aliens. But you can not agrue with a sceintifc fact thats been proven over and over again with differnt season and diiferent angles. The answer they kept getting back was a naturel landform.

Back in 1976, when the original photo was taken, the camera technology on Viking 1 was not very well, and the cloudy atmosphere did not help any. There is really no way to tell what the landform is in the picture. Now in 1998, when the second photo was taken, you can more visibly see the mesa start to take shape as the humanoid face goes away. Cameras have improved in the last 20 years, and are able to capture pictures with greater detail. In 2001, the picture is fully resolved and you can see how the landform is natural. The mesa is just like the one we have on Earth, in Idaho. Also, compared to the 43 meters for every pixel in 1976, the last picture taken in 2001 has 1.56 meters for each pixel, resulting in a higher revolution and seeing the object more clearly.

The only reason the formation look like a face is becuase of that shadows. The angle that they were at made shadows that looked like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The carma they were using at the time also wasnt that great. It was good for the time but it is not as accurate compared too more recent camras.

In the next few photos of the face of mars you can clearly see that it is just a rock formation and not a face. The face of mars was just a rock formatoin and some perfictley placed shadows. In the most recent picture of it you can see that it looks nothinhg like a face and just like a hill or big rock. Some people might say that NASA is just trying to hide the alain life but this is false.

If NASA really found life forms on a diffrent planet they would tell every body because they would make a lot of money. Every body would be interested in the new life forms and want to learn all about them. They would help found NASA to do research and do every thing they could to learn more. This meaning NASA would expaned a lot. It would get so much more income and job applications.

The the face of mars looks just like some of the natural land forms on earth. This is also just another way to prove that it is not a sign of alein life.

The world has seen the ""Face"" taken by NASA a few years ago. Some people say it's a natural landform and some people say it's an alien creation. NASA has figured out that it's just a natural landform on Mars and nothing else. NASA haven't explored all of Mars and can state it's an alien creation, there might be more than just one and they all could be natural landforms. It might look like a really weird face from above, but NASA has already stated that it's a natural landform.

NASA has explored a lot of Mars, but not enough information to say it's an alien creation. They've just found one and it looks pretty like a huge face to some people. They might find more out there just like this and it's still and ordinary landform. On Earth there are a lot of these landforms around the American West. NASA has taken a picture in really high-quality camera to show that it's just a natural lanform there.

Before Amercia had these great cameras and computers, they weren't able to get a clear picture of the face. So people just assumed that it was an alien creation/monument. If they say it is where are the facts that say it's an alien monument. Later after all those years, NASA were able to take a maxium resolution picture and post it to the world. Thousands of people were waiting to see the photo, but when they did it was just a natural landform. There was no alien creation to see and observe at.

Although NASA has said it's just a natural landform, people state that sometimes NASA doesn't want us to know certain things. Some people say it could've been a monument created by an alien civilization on Mars. They haven't gone through all of Mars and know that was there or not. NASA might eventually find more of these landforms and study to actually say it's an alien creation. Conspiracy theorists state that the face is bona fide evidence and that NASA would hide them from us. The world doesn't know what's out there to say that it's this or it's that.

Since, NASA people say that it's a natural landform, people believe them. The ""face"" is nothing else than a landform on Mars, it's known to find some of these landforms around the American West. NASA has aready proven that it's just an ordinary lanform with a maximum resolution camera and posted it to the world to see.

963aa9d,"Hi, i'm Isaac, i'm going to be writing about how this face on Mars is a natural landform or if there is life on Mars that made it. The story is about how NASA took a picture of Mars and a face was seen on the planet. NASA doesn't know if the landform was created by life on Mars, or if it is just a natural landform. On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars. In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform

I think that the face is a natural landform because there is no life on Mars that we have descovered yet. If life was on Mars, we would know by now. The reason why I think it is a natural landform because, nobody live on Mars in order to create the figure. It says in paragraph 9, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" in which he is saying that its not easy to know if it is a natural landform at this point. In all that they're saying, its probably a natural landform.

People thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars. though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars.

It says in paragraph 7, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin took a picture of Mars with his Orbiter Camera, that the face was a natural landform. Everyone who thought it was made by alieans even though it wasn't, was not satisfied. I think they were not satisfied because they have thought since 1976 that it was really formed by alieans.

Though people were not satified about how the landform was a natural landform, in all, we new that alieans did not form the face. I would like to know how the landform was formed. we know now that life on Mars doesn't exist.             ",3,1,0.8319858312606812
9642b7f,"Its Just A Landform

NASA recently has just seen a human looking face on Mars, NASA has an image of the ""Face"" and they have released it for public view. People have questioned ""Was it created by aliens?"" So many people believe that it was indeed created by aliens. I believe that it is just a natural landform and it just so happened to look like a human face, for these many reasons.

In the article ""Unmasking Face on Mars"" it states that many people believe that this is not just a landform, it is some kind of alien creation. But, i can tell you otherwise. In stanza 3 it says, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It clearly says,""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" That can give you an image of how the shadows could have formed this face like creation.

Another reason for this not being an alien cretaion as it states in stanza 7 of this article,""thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""This is a great reason for people to realize that it is not an alien creation. After a team captured another photo but ten times sharper, than the original Viking photos, they finally saw that it was nothing more than a natural landform and it must've been shadows that created such human like looks, as I already stated and also as stated in the article.

Although, people will still think it was an alien creation and NASA is keeping it away from the public, we are highly not. There has been no sight of any alien activity what so ever. The ""Face"" is not a start of alien activity and probably never will be.

In conlusion, this so called ""alien creation"" is not an alien creation. I know and believe it is not an alien creation, due to those reasons that I have named above. This human face looking creation is only and nothing more a natural landform. ",4,1,0.8619273900985718
966de07,"The face of Mars was not created by Aliens. It just happens to be a natural landform that resembles a human face. Although it has human features like the head, eyes, nose, and mouth, it is actually shadows that give it that illusion. The fact that it resembles a human head is a coincidence. If you use new high resloution images and 3D altimetry, you could see it for what it really is.

In addition, it has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and a haunted grocery store checkout line for 25 years. The fact that it has become a pop icon proves that many people have believed that the Face was concrete evidence that life had or have existed on Mars. Some people even believe that there is evidence NASA would rather hide, like conspiracy theorists, but meanwhile this all happening defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars which further proves that there is no ancient civilization on Mars.

Furthermore, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, but when it appeared on a JPL website, it revealed to be only a natural landform. This helps prove that there never was an alien momument in the first place. Although, not everybody was satisfied with this fact. They thought that perhaps that alien markings were hidden by the wispy clouds. In Malin's team's second look, they captured an extraordinary photo, but what the picture actually showed was the Martian equivalent of a mesa.

So in the end, there was no ancient civilization on Mars, no ancient momument, and the Face turned out to be only a mesa. Although many people still argue about life on Mars, there isn't enough research for it to be proven true or otherwise. The fact that the Face was mistaken was because people couldn't see it for what it truly was in the photo.",4,1,0.9177378416061401
9676232,"There could be many explanations for this mystircal face, although, the face could have just been created by the planet when formed, or it could have been made by something unexplainable. How do you think the face was formed?

The face is more than likely just another natural land form, just like here on earth, we have natural land forms that look like living animals or plants. The likely hood of the face being unatural is very slim. Being that the face had not changed for 25 years, it could mean that this is just a land form that has existed since the planets beginning.

The face is similar to a natural land form here on Earth, in the Snake River Plane of Idaho. The face shows that it is possible for it to be anything, it could be alien made, but it is highly unlikely. There has not really been any true evidence that aliens exist.

Skeptics may believe that the face could be more proof that aliens exist in outer space. Which could very well be, but there is still no strong evidence that it is true, we could be the only living planet in space.

Concluding the face is extremely likely to be just a natural formation that the planet had when it was developing. There is also no completely proof that it is alien proof, and making a face on a planet would not be the best way to comunicate with humans.",3,1,0.7987393140792847
96895a0,"Have you ever wondered about space and all of the mysterious things in space? It? a crazy topic with many mystery?. A big idea is that a face has been put on Mars from another life form. It? a rediculous thought with many people such as me shaking their heads at the crazy theroy. There is no way the another life form could put this face on Mars. It? just a cool natural landform that ironicly looks like a face.

Their are many different planets with many different natural landforms on them. Mars just happens to have one of the most interesting natrual landforms however. The face as people call it, is a huge rock formation that gives us an illusion of a face. Humans have claimed that Aliens have put this massive rock formation on there, but from a scientific side their is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that Aliens are real.

Yes, the face is quite mysterious, but their are plenty of queer landforms on every planet. The media is a place that has taken ¨The Face¨ and it has made it out to seem like Aliens have made it to scare us. I can understand why one who has no sceintific background might believe this, but these landforms can occur any where on any planet over a peroid of time.

As a scientist if you belive something you try and prove it. With the discovery of the face and people skeptic of the aliens scientist? launched a spacecraft into space to see if it could find anything. Nothing. No housing systems, no monuments, no building structures of any sorts, and most importantly no life of any sorts. Mars has harsh living conditions so to find any sort of life would be crazy enough, especially aliens!

The face is just another one of those amazing natural landforms that space has given us. It amazes me and others what things can happen in space. There are for sure no Aliens in space, however. All of the evidence proves to the fact that there is nothing on Mars or in space that could build something. Who knows maybe in a million of years space could amaze us even more with another landform similar to ¨The Face¨. I can assure you and the public that ¨The Face¨ was just another marvelous wonder of a natural landform no evidense of anything like aliens. Space is a crazy wonder that has many things to dicover.",3,1,0.8991867303848267
96904d6,"The face that is on Mars was not created by aliens. We have noticed that aliens wouldn't be able to do this type of thing with just there hands. That the faces on mars had to be created by the storms that have gone through mars the past couple of years. Aliens can't just build a face because they wouldn't know what a human face looks like. The face on Mars has to be either created by storms or it was just a physical feature.

The very first thing that we had thought that had created the face on Mars was aliens, but we had concluded that aliens couldn't have done this the only thing that could do this is the weather. Over the past couple years the face had become more clear possibly because of the strong winds passing by. On Mars they have a lot of sandstorms which could build up over a long period of time. The only thing we could believe was how did they put holes for the eyes in the sand. The sand could have stuck together to form the mouth and the nose. The other thing that could have built the face on Mars is just the physical features that had on it before the sand got blown off of it.

Something else that we cocluded is that the face on Mars had been there for a long period of time before they even noticed physical feature. Before they sent Viking One on Mars they never got a clear shot of the face from a satellite. The face could have been hidden in the sand, and all of a sudden there was a big gusty wind and sand was flying every where. The face started to slowly appear out from under the sand. Over the past couple years more of it was starting to appear onto Mars surface where we could see it better.

The only possible way that the face could have been created was either by storm or already the physical feature that had been on it for centuries. The storm could have done it by the gusty winds and sand building up, or the gusty winds revieling the face. We haven't descovered any aliens on Mars yet so we had to eliminate an option. THe only way that we could conclude if the aliens did build it is see a real alien on Mars. That is what we the scientist have concluded about the creation of the face on Mars.

This shows that they found something that looked similar to a face on Mars. But the text in paragraph eight states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" This shows that they assumed that there was life on Mars just by seeing that landform that looked similar to a face.

96b79d0,"This is

Dianee and she is going to eplain to you why the ""face"" was not created by aliens. It all started in 1976 when Viking 1 took a photo of the ""face"". The face was located in Cydonia it is two miles long from end to end. It looked like a face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. It is actually a mesa. Then,in 1998 the MOC wanted to take another picture because many people were saying that it was created by aliens. This picture would be in movies,books,magazines,radio talk shows and even in grocery stores for twenty five years.

When NASA let the public see this picture they believed it was created by aliens. We went back in 1998 and took some more pictures and it had still looked like a face but it was not. My people said that we (NASA) would rather hide then say that there was life on Mars, many conspiracy theorists were saying. We wouldn't hide we would tell the public so that we could get more money to be able to go to Mars and see these aliens.

What some people wanted was aliens and other people didn't. Mostly all the scientists at NASA including myself did not believe that the""face"" was created by aliens. So in 2001 we went again to Mars to get a picture of the ""face"". It would be a clearer picture because the cameras were ten times better than the cameras in 1976 and in 1998. It was very hard to get to that exact spot on Mars. The face on Mars was 41 degrees north martian latitude. On April 8,2001 it was summer in Cydonia when we had taken the picture in 1998 it was winter and it was very cloudy. The camera was 1.56 meters per pixel in 1976 it was 43 meters per pixel.

So if there was objects on Mars like a plane of a pyramid we would know because we would be able to see it. We said that it was either a butte or a mesa. They are commom in the American West. It's kinda like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. They are basically lava domes but the one on Mars had looked like a face becasuse of the shadows. So,in conclusion the ""face"" is not created by aliens based on these facts.",4,1,0.8413189053535461
96cde53,"The ""face on Mars"" is a natural landform. There was not enough evidence to prove it was a face, but there was enough valid evidence to prove it wasn't. First it had shadows. The shadows made an illusion giving it a mouth and a nose. The text says shadows made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. The text says Martian mesas are common around Cydonia. If mesas are common couldn't this just be another one.

Mars Global Surveyor flew over and MOC took a picture showing it was a natural landform. Still, people weren't pleased. People said alien markings were hidden by haze. The MOC went back and took more than one picture still showing a natural landform. The landform showed the equivalence of a buttle.

Some would say it's all part of a government plan. Then why would they waste time, energy, and resources to take multiple pictures. Garvin even said ""It's not easy to target Cydonia."" He said, ""In fact, it's hard work."" The text compared it to the Middle Buttle in the Snake River. The face did in fact gain popularity.   ",3,1,0.8755193948745728
9729ecc,"Is the Face on Mars created by aliens? Certainly not, as NASA has created many pieces of evidence to prove to conspiracy theorists that this is nothing but a Martian mesa.

In the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it is discussed that many people believed that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. In 1976, a picture from NASA's Viking 1 was sent to mission control. This picture was what seemed to look like a face. However, scientists quickly derailed that idea, discovering it was just a mesa, a type of landform common in western America. Days later, NASA released the photo to the public. This stirred up lots of conspiracy theories and became an iconic landmark that isn't on Earth! However, they were wrong. So many people were in the thought that the picture was a face built by aliens, so NASA decided to take another picture in 1998, proving that it was just a natural landform. But once again, skeptics thought otherwise, which brings the case to where it is today. In 2001, NASA launched another spacecraft to take a picture. This picture was taken using a maximum resolution camera spanning ""1.56 meters per pixel,"" compared to the ""43 meters per pixel."" This is about 30x the resolution of the 1976 photo, ensuring that the picture would stop all consiracy theories. It is now impossible to say that this is not a Martian mesa, as photographs at the highest quality have been taken in perfect conditions.

Although it might have been possible to claim the landform on Mars was build by aliens 30 years ago, technology and science today have proven that theory entirely wrong. The face can continue to live as a pop icon, but now it is now impossible to say the landform was built by aliens. So to answer the question, ""Is the face on Mars created by aliens?"" One can now easily say, ""no.""",3,1,0.9113832712173462

In paragraph twelve, Garvin states that the Face on Mars reminds him of a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This Face is unusual, but there are outlines and some other formations on planets that are more different than this. In paragraph seven, on April 5, 1998, there was another Face on Mars. A JPL website revealed that there was no alien monument at all. It was just a natural landform.

Only conspiracy theorists state that aliens made the Face on Mars. They don't have the right technology to state that this theory is actually true. Only NASA has the right technology to research this Face and can tell whether this is true. In paragraph seven, because the other Face on Mars have been proven to actually be a natural landform, what makes the other face any different? Aliens have not been proven real at all. So what makes aliens want to make a face on Mars? Even if aliens were real, they wouldn't make any face on Mars. They would make something more complicated.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not made by any aliens at all. Instead, it is a natural landform that probably was made by an asteroid or a meteor that was floating around in space.

Scientists made the conclusion about the Face based on facts.

Also, the camera scientists used was great at capturing the Face, and the Face is very similiar to landforms we have on Earth.

These reasons are why the Face is a natural landform.

The Face is a natural landform because scientists made the conclusion based on facts.

Throughout the article, scientists took various photos of the Face.

In all of these photos, scientists concluded that it was just a natural landform.

Also, scientists study Mars often, they have never seen any traces of alien artifacts.

There are more facts to believe the Face was a natural landform than an alien aritifact.

Another reason to believe the Face was just a natural landform is because the camera they used was very good at detailing the Face.

In paragraph 10, the article states that each pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel from the photo in 1976.

This means the photo was a good picture to study off of.

Also, in paragraph 11, the article says the camera could have captured things like planes, pyramids, or shacks.

If there was anything like that on Mars, the camera would have seen it.

Since we did not see anything through the camera, we do not have a reason to believe the Face was an alien artifact.

97cb710,"In 1976, the Viking 1 took a photo of what was thought to be a 'face' on Mars. The 'face' had a shadow that loomed over the formation; the shadow making it appear as a human face. NASA was thrilled when the Viking 1 captured the picture. A few days after the team found it, NASA reveiled the picture to the public.

Ever since the photo was published, theorists have speculated over what the formation actually was. Many were to believe that it was an alien structure. In fact, it actually is not. The 'alien artifact' is actually a mesa. Mesas are commonly found on planets such as Earth. There would be no possible way that the mesa would be an alien structure.

In the passage, NASA has been taking pictures of it from 1976, 1998, and 2001. Since then, the images have been sharper. In 2001, the picture clearly shows a mesa, not a face. When the latest photo was taken, Malin's team had made the digital picture three times sharper than the rest of the photos. He states that if you were to take a picture of pyramids or other formations, you would be able to clearly see what they were.

The 'Face on Mars' is just a conspiracy theory. No one can actually confirm that there is such thing to exist. If there was such thing on Mars, NASA would probably examine it a bit closer and may reveal to the public about it, but for now, we can only wonder if there really is a face on Mars.

For example, the fact that the Face looked like a rock formation, the use of a different camera to show every little detail, and the point that the picture actually shows the landform which is a butte or a mesa.

First off, when NASA first found the picture they unveiled the image to the public to catch their attention. The caption of the picture read ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This example shows that it looked like a human head but it was a rock formation.

Second, in paragraph eleven, the author says ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Clearly this example proves that if aliens were the ones that created this face, their would be proof because with this camera you would be able too see any trace of anything that was there or footsteps of aliens.

Lastly, paragraph twelve states what the ""image"" was. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms commond around the American West."" This example says that what it was in reality was landform.

To end this arguemnt, right now in your head you might be thinking ""Pheraps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Well, that is why the NASA used a three times better camera to reassure the public of the landform.

Secondly, in paragraph 7, it stated ""...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper...the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing...a natural landform...not alien monument after all.""

My side is that the face on mars could be seen wrong, it could be a pile of rocks, and there is many wierd things on this planet with weird shapes, it cant always be martians or aliens.

So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either. First the face is way to larg to be an actual face, it say it the artical the it is measured in meters, thats almost impossible. It also says in the artical that the face on mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face.

It is a real debate on whether the face is real or not. There is also strong evidence on both sides, but NASA has alot of proof that it isn't an alien, they could be hiding it or they can be wrong.

98a7fbf,"Did you know that NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was the first spacecraft of any sort to see the mysterious face on Mars? This mysterious face was first discovered in 2001. I am a scientist from NASA that has been researching this unusual, shadowy likeness of a human face since about twenty-five years ago. My name is Ellie. I get all sorts of questions and opinions asked to me about the human face. Some people say that they do not think that it's real, and that NASA is just making it up to get more people to notice us. Well, that would be wrong, considereing that we have pictures to prove it. We know that the face is just a natural landform because the pictures show it to be almost equivalent of a mesa or butte, and it looks identical to the Middle Butte in Idaho.

We know that the shadowy likeness of a human face is just a natural landform because is looks almost equivalent to a mesa or a butte. We have many questions asking things like, "" How do you know that aliens didn't form it?""

and, ""How do we know that this picture is not photoshopped to get NASA more commercial business?"" The answer is we don't know exactly what formed it, but our research shows that it is a natural landform. First of all, pictures do not lie, especially that camera that we took it with. We took the picture with using a camera's absolute maximum resolution. In this camera, ""each pixel in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"" as we know from our research. Also, the mysterious landform that we captured looked like a mesa or a butte- landforms that are common around the American Midwest. to add to that, the Face takes the same shape as a lava dome and the same height. Not only does the face look almost equivalent to a mesa or butte, but it also looks almost identical to most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Another reson that we know that the Face is just a natural landorm is because it looks almost identical to a landform is Idaho. People send NASA emails, and letters asking questions. One of our most states opinions is,"" Just because it looks like a landform on Earth doesn't mean anything. Things might be different there and there could be aliens there."" Yes that could be true, but our research and pictures also prove it to be wrong. The first snapshot of the Face was captured was a long time ago. Since then our camera and photo quality has improved. Today we now have way better pictures of the Face than we did over twenty-five years ago. That means that we can see the landform better and look at the different characteristics of the landform. Then after we looked at the characteristics, we found that the Face had almost the exact same size, shape, quality of a landform in Idaho, United States. Also, one of our researches stated the definition of the Middle Butte. He stated,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face in Mars. Thousands of web surfers had been anxiously waiting for images for NASA to be revealed. Until one day we released the pictures. As we knew already, web surfers found that there was ""no alien monument after all"" as we know from our research. We also released how we took the picture. We had a picture taken by a camera on board MGS, but it had to peer through clouds. Then people started saying statements like,"" Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze."" Once again, that cannot be true because the characteristics and qualities of the Face look exactly like a part of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Now you have been proved wrong, and I hope all your questions were answered about the Face, or at least the questions that were stated in the article. we have done a lot of research on this mysterious human face, and found that it was not created by aliens. We know that it is a landform because it looks like a mesa or a butte, and it looks almost identical to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Therefore, this Face is just a landform.

Later when the photo was released to the public conspiracy theorists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but the picture was taken on an older camera on the Viking I that the photo was fuzzy and no one could be sure of what was on the Face. Twenty-two years later another photo was taken with a camera ten times sharper than the original viking I photo. Still some people believed it was an alien artifact and the clouds on mars covered some alien markings that may have been covered by haze. Some theorists believed that NASA was trying to hide evidence of alien life on Mars. Others questioned theorists about why NASA would want to hide something like that and how it would benefit scientists at NASA. Three years later another team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

The Face on Mars is not a really face. There can not be life on Mars. First, aliens are not real. Second, there is no oxgyen. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" states ""huge rock formation.... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth.""

The Face on Mars only happen one time. Another aircraft went back at the same degress and a cloudy day just like the one before. When it took the picture there was just a landform. This aircraft even had a better camera and took even more pictures.

The article says "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Gavin says "" It reminds me most of Middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an islated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

in paragraph 3 it claims that a huge rock formation which resembles a human head. in the artical it even says that it most likely couldve been a rock. this is one of the reason why i agree with the way it wasnt formed by aliens it was a rock. alien are yet to be discovered where in this view u cant say that it was a alien it is not.",2,1,0.7768904566764832
9914633,"NASA's spacecraft, Viking 1, caught the first image of the ""Face on Mars"" while looking for landing sites. When those pictures were sent back to NASA, they saw a face staring back at them. Due to our advancement in technology, they took more pictures that were much better quality. Today, the Face is still known as a pop icon. However, a few scientists are still discussing the matter if it's just a natural landform or created by alien life. There are numerous facts that prove it to be natural.

One reason why it's unreasonable that the Face was created by alien life is that there's no legit proof of alien existence on Mars or anywhere. Only myths and rumors have been heard. I know for a fact NASA has been searching for it because defenders of the NASA budget wish to find life on Mars, but there are no traces. There are just theories with no support at all.

Not only is there no evidence of aliens, but it doesn't make sense that an ""alien"" created a face of a human with tools made for hard, rock surfaces. If humans have never encountered aliens and aliens have never encountered humans, how could aliens create something in our likeness. Although, we don't know if they've encountered us, it seems highly unlikely. It seems more unlikely for them to make a human face that looks like a Pharaoh. ""Aliens"" don't know what a pharaoh is as well as what it looks like. In addition to that, what tools would they have used to make a landform 2 miles long... a pick axe? On Earth, something like Mount Rushmore takes a lot of work to form even with the right tools.

Along with the lack of sense of the idea that aliens can create a human face with a pick axe, NASA has research that show that that type of landform is common on Mars. The Viking 1 had taken the picture around an area on Mars called Cydonia. That's where scientists in the Jet Propulsion Lab classified the landform as a Martian mesa. ""Martian mesa"" is just a name for the landform, and their research displayed that those mesas were common enough around Cydonia.

In conclusion, the theory that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens lack much credibilty. The fact that it has almost no supporting facts for it to be proven true. Therefore, the Face can only exist on Mars as a natural landform.",3,1,0.871832549571991
9916173,"Is it aliens or is it a natural landform? About twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, and was taking photographs. As Viking 1 was taking photos, there was one certain photo that caught NASA's eye. A photo the seemed to look like a face. NASA believes it was an alien artifact, but it really is just a natural landform. Mars' ""face"" is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.

Thoughout the years that the ""face"" of Mars was known, there is a change of the landform. Looking at the pictures of 1976, 1998, and 2001 the landform changes. By the time of 1998 the landform has more cracks in it. On April 5, 1998 thousands of people on the web were waiting to see another picture of the land on Mars. The people were not satisfied and said it was not fair. They complained and said it was the cloudiest time of the year for the Red Planet. Yes, they realized that Mars also has wheather. The most common is the sand storms it has. The wind and sand that moves around will change that landform of the surface. The land of Mars will breakdown into even more sand. Like most planets, the land will change by its wheather. The land is caused by natural causes of wheather, not by aliens.

The ""face"" of Mars is caused by natural causes. It is caused by the wheather. Thoughout the years the land and its figure changes. Mars' face is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.",3,1,0.7950424551963806

There are many pieces of evidence proving that the Face is just a natural landform. First, and probably the most obvious, the Face is only seen at a certain angle, due to the shadowing around the landform. In paragraphs one, two, and three the author states numerous times how the ""unusual shadows...made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" In paragraph eight, the author states ""the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude...."" Second, the first picture of the Face was taken in 1976, meaning that the Face could have been a result of the poor camera quality back then. The scientists at NASA back in 1997 even wanted to take another picture to see if the Face was just a natural landform. When the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of the same landform in 1998 with improved camera quality, it showed that it was just a natural landform. In 2001, scientists took a third photo proving the Face was just a natural landform. In paragraph 1, the author states ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet...when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" In paragraph seven, the author states ""...his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" and ""...anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared... revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" In paragraph twelve the author states ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West."" The Face was also used as a way to entertain the public and shine more light onto Mars. At the end of paragraph three, the author states ""the authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" These claims and evidence to support them are just a few pieces of proof that the Face of Mars is a natural landform.

Some people believe the Face on Mars was made by aliens, and that there is alien life on Mars.

It was formed just like the landform would on earth and the pictures clearly show it's not even a face anymore. Everything adds up to mesa and the thought of ancient artifacts are pointless. There is no life evidence on Mars. You guys are called conspiracy theorists for a reason. The word theory is a guess. This isn't a guess. At NASA we figured out it is a mesa landform and have proof.

In the article it says that it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The real question is the photo taken was it the face of an alien?

In the article it states that there must have been a surprising expression on the faces of the mission controllers face back at Jet Propulsion Lab. Soon after the misson controlls saw the photo they, have firgured out it was just simple another Martin messa, common enough around Cydonia. In the article it says that the unusual shadows that made it look like an Eyptian Pharaoh, it is also very interesting to hear what they compared it to.

99d5f44,"What do you think this discovery is that appears to be a face in the crust of one of Earth's neighboring planets Mars. Scientist at NASA have proven with evidence that the supposable Face on Mars is not alien made. The Face that has appeared on Mars is not a sign of life on Mars, but really is just the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, that are a common landform on Earth.

NASA has conducted three missions to the red planet just to inspect the giant landform and each time they have came back with the same result. Thirty-nine years ago the Face was discovered and was realized to be just a Meas. Twenty-one years later NASA launches it's second mission to inspect the Face once more. Michael Malin and is Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original. The results of this mission were the same as the very first, the face is a natural landform. Just after that in 2001 NASA used a high quality camera with maximum resolution. Just to reveal that the Face was what they had suspected all along, the landform they had concluded on thirty nine years ago.

The area where the Face was discovered,Cydonia, is actually known for having landforms that are similar to the one that some believe to be of alien realtion. There could be mutiple of these landforms that look like a huge face, but they just haven't been discovered yet. These landforms are most definetly a mesa because they are the exact same heighth and width of the mesas that are found here on Earth.

Even if this hoax that people say that the Face is a sign of life that used to be on Mars was true NASA would definetly release it to the public. The reason being is because this would be a huge benefit to the space program. The findings of Martian life would be amazing to hear and would bring much more funding to the exploration of the planet, but this isn't the case.

In conclusion after three NASA space missions, three similar pictures, and the smartest people together they all reach the conclusion that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. What more evidence could you need, millions of dollars have been spent just to try to convince the public that the face was obviously not any kind of sign that there is life on Mars.

Did anliens do it? Was it just a blur in the picture? Through the years people have been trying to figure out this mistory.

I can asure you that it was not aliens. Since the year of 1976 we were able to get better and clearer photos. On March 5, 1998 one of our Mars Surveyor flew over the ""face"" for the first time. Michael Marlin took a picture ten times better than the original image. We thought that would for sure clear up all the alien talk. The image showed a natural landform, but that didn't satisfy everone.

The picture was taken during a cloudy time on Mars. Since the camera had to look through clouds skeptics said ""alien marking were hidden by haze.""

Once again Media was talking about how there is still a posibility that the landform was created by something not of our world. We were stuburn to prove them wrong.

It is not easy, but we tried again. On April 8, 2001 we had another chance. Soon Marlins team captured an extraordinary photo. Now they used a camera even more high tech than before. You could see the details in the photo. This time the photo was taken on a clear day. We studied the photo here at NASA, and you can clearly see the photo is of a landform much like a butte or mesa, which are often found in the American West. Thanks to the upgraded technology you can clearly see it's just an ordinary land form.",3,1,0.8660349249839783

According to the text,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

Second, when we took a picture of the Face in 1976. It was because of the weather that it looked like a face. Another reason is because of the angle that we took a picture in. It might also have been the camera. Because of the angle that in took the picture in, the shadow of the mountains made it look like a face. According to the text,""The caotion noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth.""

Next, in 1998, we decided to take another picture of the Face. The tecnology became better and so we got a better view of the Face. It does't look as much like the face we took a picture of in 1976. This time it looked more like a crater. It wasn't a face after all.

Then, in 2001, we took another picture because it was so popular. According to the author,""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" You might think that aliens are real. According to the text,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" We have been searching Mars for a while now and if there was any life form on Mars we would have found it already.

Finally, Face is just another natural land form. According to the author,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

The first picture was taken in 1976.The picture was taken by a spacecraft named Viking 1. I believe that the face is just a natural landform and is not made by aliens.

First, in the passage it tells you that when they first looked at the image it shocked them. They thought to themselves that it looked like a face. Then, from the minute people saw the photo everyone agreed and called it a face, but no one knew how it formed.

Next, there was a disscussion amoung scientist about the face. Few scienctist believed that it was an alien artifact. So from reading this I take the einfitive to believe that the face isn't made by an alien. It is just a natural landform created.

From reading the passage it also gives proof to why it couldn't be an alien artifact. For example, the pictures, it shows you the different and sharper pictures the spacecraft took and as you go along and you see the 2001 picture you see that the picture doesn't look like a face anymore and just looks like a natural landform.

Another example is in the last paragraph, when Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said That the picture actuallly shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are commonly around the American West.

In conclusion, there is a lot of proof to why the face that was found on Mars isn't an alien artifact, but is a natural landform. The pictures show it and it mentions it in a couple of paragraphs to why it couldn't be a face. So in the end, the face is just a natural landform not a face or an alien artifact.There isn't enough facts or data to prove that the face is an artifact. ",3,1,0.8671409487724304
9abbe35,"Now you may be wondering if the face on Mars was created by aliens? I'm gpoing to be completely honest with you, but no it is not. Now you may be saying ""Oh you work for NASA so you're just trying to cover it up."" Yes I do recall getting hired by NASA, but I do not recall us ever trying to cover up an alien artifact.

In 1976, scientists just figured out it was just unusual shadows making it look like a human's face, but this was the only Martian mesaa in Cydonia that made it look like it has a face. Now ever since then, the ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon. It was in a movie,books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even griocery stores. Do you know how long? 25 YEARS!

If there was life on Mars or any other planet and we were trying to hide it then that will be pretty much not smart to do. I mean the NASA budget wish. So in 1998 we took another picture but as it turned out it was...natural landform. But as everyone know. NOT EVERYBODY WAS SATISFIED!!! So on April 8th, 2001 we took another picture and all you saw were landforms for example like the American West. So there is no proof that ""The Face On Mars"" were created by aliens. Any questions?",2,1,0.8990638256072998
9ad9ce8,"Mars is a planet in our solar system. Have you ever wondered if there was life on it? I have. Mars is a long way from our home on Earth. About 25 years ago NASA found a landform that looks like a face. NASA has researched this landform ever since they found it. Some people belive that the fae has to do with some typwe of alien or live activity on Mars. I'm here to tell you differet.

Life on Mars. Does that sound like a logical explination to this ""Face""? If there were life on earth, wouldnt NASA have found it by now? You have to have water, food, oxygen, to live. There has been no proof of any of those things. Say there were aliens living on earth. Would that make a difference in how we lived? My opinion it would. There would be different things, different looking people maybe. You can not live without water or oxygen. Oxygen is not on Mars or in outer space. There has also been no proof of water on Mars either.

The article says that for almost 25 years, NASA has been looking for proof on what this thing is. If Someone were to say that aliens lived among us, would you believe them? I know I wouldn't. Aliens are things created to scare us. Maybe there are such things are Aliens., maybe there aren't. We will possibly never know the truth. ",2,1,0.7332120537757874
9b13fdc,"You have just found out that there is a face on Mars. The only question is; is there a face on Mars? I am here to tell you that there is not a face on the planet Mars. The reason that it is not a ""face"" on Mars is; the time it was taken, that there are butte or mesas on Mars, and the amount of pixles it was taken in.

My first reason that there is not a face on Mars is; the time it was taken. Back in 1976, which was not a long time ago, but technology has changed inbetween the photographs. Their was new technology, but it was not as advanced as it is in 1998, or 2001. Like the sentence in paragraph 3 stating "" a ""huge rock formation. . . which resembles a human head. . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."""" The statement is saying that it was not face, but a mere illusion given by the shadows.

The next reason to prove that there is no face on Mars is; There are butte,and mesa on Mars, and on Earth. A butte,and a mesa is a "" lave dome that takes form of an isolated mesa.""As it says in paragraph 12 also. "" About the same heights as the Face on Mars"" The paragraph is stating that there are objects on Earth like the ones on Mars, but we dont get the reflection of the Sun on Mars, like we do on Earth.

My last proving that there are is not and never will be a ""face"" on Mars is; The amount of pixles it was taken in and the resolution. As paragraph 10 states ""captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximun resolution."" The camera in 2001, was more advanced than the one in 1976, but in paragraph10 is also states"" each pixel in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo."" The camera in 1976 was only 43 meters per pixel, while the one in 2001 has 1.56 meters per pixel, keep in mind that they were at their best resolution, Thats over a 200% decrease in the pixels in a matter of 24 years.

In conclusion, science has came a long way from the original picture, and the scientist worked hard to prove that there was no life ""face"" on the planet. I have done my part of trying to covince you that there is no life, but the final question will be; Will you believe me or not?",4,1,0.849510669708252
9b6a4d6,"A Face on Mars, or just a common mesa? Many skeptics belive that the mesa on Mars, located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, is proof of ancient alien civilazation. In 1976, when NASA's Viking 1 crossed over a landform that showed ""shadowy likeness"" of a human face. When NASA revealed the picture to the public, thinking it would be a good way to draw attention to Mars, caused an uproar.

A few years later, Micheal Malin and his team took a picture 10x sharper than that of the Viking 1 spacecraft. When the photo first appeared online, it showed nothing but a common mesa that can be found in the American west. Again skepics were not satisfied, the picture was taken on a cloudy day over Mars. So they began to ask questions like; What if the alein markings were hidden by haze?

So again, on a perfectly clear day, another photo was taken April 8th, 2001. They used the camera's ""absolute maximum resolution."" Yet again, showing nothing but a common landform. Well what if NASA is hiding evidence of ancient alein life on Mars? Why would NASA hide groundbreaking news like this? ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was anceint civilazation on Mars.""

So why would NASA hide news like this, that would help advance space exploration? What else could it be, all evidence points to nothing except a common mesa. ",2,1,0.8079168796539307
9b7b295,"Did you know in 1976 a picture was taken of a ""face"" on Mars?

Most people believe that it is a sign that there is life on Mars or a sign of aliens. But, people who agree with NASA know it is actually just a mesa. There is two sides to this picture of a ""face"" either you think it is a sing of life or it is a mesa. So, the figure similar to a face isn't a face because it is similar to landforms on Earth, the figure is to big to be a real face, and it is actually a mesa.

Matter of fact, the figure/landform on Mars similar to a ""face"" is a lot like landforms on planet Earth. For example,""'It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.""(12) This quote provides evidence that the figure/landform on Mars is similar to landforms on Earth. So, this is evidence that the figure on Mars is just a landform like what we have on Earth.

Next, the figure similar to a ""face"" is to big to be a real face. For example,""An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end.""(1) This quote shows that the head is to big to be a real face. Like, what face is two miles long from end to end?

Last but not least, the figure/landform similar to a ""face"" is actually a mesa! For example,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""(12) This quote proves that the figure/landform is just a mesa. There is no life on Mars or aliens making signs. It is simply just a common landform.

Finally, the figure/landform similar to a face isn't a face. It isn't a face because it is a common landform on Earth. It is way to big to be a real face. Also, the figure/landform is simply just a mesa. These are all reasons and proof that the landform on Mars isn't a sign of life or aliens it is just a common landform.",3,1,0.8547781705856323
9b80a7f,"Unsual sightings happen all the time , some believe supernatural opions and others say it was naturally formed or some go to the extent to say mankind made it. I belived the ""Face"" was natraully formed. My support for this claim is that the ""Face"" formed into a face over several years let it be known that it was jus a rock when it was discovered now that was in 1976 come back several years later in 1998 its started to form into a shape. The discoverors come back in 2001 is starting to look like a face. Now my point is that if the ""Face"" was supernatraul it should've been made supernatrauly. What that means is that discoverors came back almost 2 decades ago and 2 years exactly after they first discovered it. Then they come back again 2 yrs later if its super natraul it should have been made quicker than that more efficient . People came back to the face 22 yrs later that sounds like 22 yrs later that it formed in that 22 yr time period. If aleins made it would probably not take that long to make if they can technology to fly billions of light years from here to there theycouldve made that face faster but thats my point it was made naturally not by aliens nor mankind it ws formed over the years and is now considered a natural land form.",2,1,0.6184186339378357

The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to a mesa here on Earth. You may think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, but there is substantial evidence to prove otherwise, that the ""Face"" is nothing more than a natural landform.

There is plenty of evidence to support the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation. If the Face were created by an alien civilization, NASA would greatly benefit. Therefore, there would be no reason to hide the information. ""defenders of the NASA budjet wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" (5). The second photo of the Face on Mars was claimed by some to be inconclusive because of the haze created by the winter weather on Mars. However, a third photo of the Face was taken on April 8, 2001 ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia [the region of Mars where the Face resides]"" (10) tat also clearly shows that the Face on Mars is not a face at all, but simply a natural land formation.

'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,'"" (12). If the ruins of an alien civilization actually existed on Mars, NASA would reap a great benifit, meaning that there would be no reason to hide the discovery. The first picture showing the Face on Mars as merely a natural landform was dismissed by skeptics because the time of year the photo was taken gave the camera a layer of haze to look through to see the face. This haze, skeptics said, hid the alien markings from view. However, this was disproven in April 2001, when a new photo was taken during the clear summertime on Mars. This photo still showed that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural formation similar to the mesas of Earth.",3,1,0.8988146781921387

The face of on the stone may possibly be weather created by its own planet. In the artical it states, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa."" Which this means the face looked like landforms juist like on earth, that are found in the American west.

In paragraph 11 a man states about the ""rule of the thumb"" which tells us about how you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. this explains to us that if the face was real there shouldve been other things to see around it.

Lastly in paragraph 7 the artical says in April 1998, they sent Cydonia over to mars too take pictures and there was no cloudy weather it was perfectly fine, and it took photos of the face. People at home were waiting for the picture to be released, just to find that it was a natural landform.

People can beleive that this is a real face however, they are wrong becauase that the pictue that was taken by cydonia looks just like a normal, natural landform and also the image they had, if they would've zoomed in on it 3 times they should've seen oher things. They also say that the face just looks like a mesa just like in the west of America.

Evidence from the text shows that when NASA first seen this picture that they thought nothing of it for the simple fact that it has been seen in areas in West America thats natural and so they thought it was a Martain mesa. This is making them believe that is was just another Martain mesa. When the NASA revelaed the pictures they made a caption that said ""huge rock fromation. . . which resembles to a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth"" later on this image was talked about alot because many believe that there used to be alien life form on Mars. On April 8, 2001 Mars Global

Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at this huge rock froming a human head. They noticed that this was just another rock and that there was no sign of alien life form on Mars. In the text NASA said that they revealed this photo to the world to engage the public and attract attetion to Mars. But not everyone was satisfied the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Prehaps, said skeptics alien marking were hidden by haze but there were no real evidence to prove it were alien marks made. Nevertheless on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a pitcure ten times sharper then the original photo the new pitcure revealed that is was just a natural landfrom and that there were no alien monument on Mars after all.

In the text it states that ""NASA's Vicking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for it's siter Vicking 2, when it had spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" Now if the human face object was created by aliens then we would have of seen some kind of evidence that they would have left behind.

""Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landfrom"". The website could have of not been shown to the public, but the NASA wanted the people to know that their was no aliens involved in ""the Face monument"".

Two, NASA is a professional agency, why would they not tell the truth. Three, the images themself prove that the Face is just a natural landform.

The Face resembles landforms on Earth. In the passage it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.' Some critics may argue that the landform is not like the others; however, it is similar to the land forms on Earth. Plus, there are tons of land forms on Mars, so why would this one be any different.

NASA is a professional agency, why would they lie. In the passage it says ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Therefore, why would NASA keep that information from the people when it would actually benefit them. If NASA says that the Face is just a land form and only looks like a face because of the shadows, then it obviously is.

Besides, the images are proof that it is nothing more than a natural landform. After all, seeing is believing. The images progressively get better and better. Some people may argue that the when they took the picture in ""April 98a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" But that cant be true since NASA eventually went out and took an even better picture in 2001, proving that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform.

In conclusion, in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" the Face was just a natural landform, it was not created by aliens. The Face resembled land forms on Earth. NASA is a government agency and would not lie about it, since it would overall benefit them. Last but not least, the images are enough proof that it is nothing more than a land form.

Although there are many consperacy theorys, all have been proven wrong becasue it is just a heap of martian material. These theorys have been proven wrong by the pictures, the fact that the shadows give it the charectaristics of a face, and the reason it is not photographed much is not the Goverment, and N.A.S.A hiding proof of alien life. It is simply the fact that we do not pass the face often since 1976 when we first glimpsed the face, Alien existance theorys have spiraled into being both well know, and well conceived. The only problem with these ideas are that the pictures do not support those ideals. There are clear pictures that with out a doubt show no strange markings, or proof of an alien race. These picyures just show it how it is, A Messa.

Furthermore the face is just a large hill. The shadows, of some of the crevaces give off the apperance of being humanoid. Charectaristics such as eyes, nose, and even a mouth appear,but it simply a trick of the light.

As for the people who say Nasa is just ""covering up"" the fact that alien exist or have existend, are simply mistaken. The reason the Face is not often photographed is because we just do not passover the Face often. There is no alien life on Mars, or at least none that are affiliated with the Face.

In conclusion through the hard facts, and evidence of pictures, the shadows mistaken for human features, and the fact that our rover, and satalites just simply do not passover the Face often, support the fact the Face was not created by an alien race. Although the theorys are interesting, fun to look at and read it is important to know the truth. The Face is a messa, sitting on Mars, with slightly human like charactarisics.

I think it is safe to say that the face on Mars is just a natrual landform. NASA thinks that, so maybe we shoud too. After all they are scientist and part of NASA that knows all this.

""Yeah! I know there's a face on Mars and i want you scientists to stop hiding the evidence!""

Here we go again I thought. I had seen thousands of people like him, asking the exact same thing. and every time my reply was the same: There is no face on Mars. The appearance of the face is caused by shadows on a mesa.

However they never believe me. ""Those pictures are faked so that you can hide the evidence!""

I always give them the standard reply that the pictures are official and that is that.

One thing I as a scientist don't understand about these people is why they think an alien civilization would build a giant replica of a HUMAN face. Theres no way they'd even know we existed, so why bother?

In conclusion conspiracy theorists are going to believe there is a face on Mars no matter how much evidence we give them to the contrary, so why even bother trying.      ",2,1,0.7704768776893616

Have you ever believed something that wasn't true? I have, but before you believe it you have to find out if it's true or not. In the article it says the ""face"" looks like it could have been a Martian mesa. Also the shadows and the lighting could be making it look more like a face. There for if the NASA wanted to go there to get evidence it would cost them a huge budget.

What if the ""face"" was a Martian mesa? It could be one. The NASA was watching it through the years and figured out it looked like it could be a Martian mesa or butte. It was also very common to see Martians around the Cydonia, just this one had unusual shadows that made it look different from the other ones. It could all just be a natural landform that looks like a face.

The shadows could be making the Martian look like a face. From the angle where they took the picture. The picture could have changed how the picture came out. The human mind can form shandows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Some people said it would be a good way to engage the people and attract attention to Mars. Some people can just be fooled by them and thinking it really is a face.

To get evidence from Mars to see if it is really a face would cost NASA a huge budget. Just to go to Mars is a lot, but to go there and get evidence from there and bring it to Earth is a lot. It also can effect the way back to Earth and be dangerous. They don't stop at Cydonia so they would have to plan it out and get all the supplies they would need to get there and get the evidence they need.

People will believe almost anything anyone says. You just got to have evidence to know if it's true or not. There are so many things to make the Martian look like a face. Like meteriods could of hit it and knock off a piece of it. They could of just got the wrong side, lighting, or shadows of it. So before you believe anything anyone says make sure it's true and not just something made up.               ",3,1,0.8601258993148804

Exactly, so therefor this Unmasking the face on Mars, is antural. I mean jsut look at the way it is imprinted into Mars, there is physically no way an alien could do this. I think that believing that an alien could possibly do this, is just crazy.

The evidence i have are these pictures, i mean look at them. Also just listen to others opinons, some agree that aliens are no where near smart enough to do something like this. I think it is a nautral fromation because this is a scientific object here, it is a planet. So there for why would it not be? Many things happen on a daily basis. Also things age, possibly it is jsut aging and slowly starting to decae. This "" face on Mars "" thing is honestly just weird. I believe that maybe something somewhere happened in the past and thar is how the face got there so basically naturally, i just do not agree that aliens could have done naything close to this.

"" Unmasking the afce on Mars"", that is an opionated statement. It could be true, but it could be not true also. These pictures show not one bit of proof of laiens, so how could aliens do this? They could not have. These little air soace craft things go around and aorund and around for seconds, mintues, hours, days, years, so there is phsyically not a way for these aliens to become invisable and create a face on Mars.

This amazing land form was a great thing to see but aliens did not create such beauty. Some people do not even think aliens are real but in my oppinion it was just a landform. It is a coinsadence that this land formed a human face but there is evidence that this is just a landfom.

In the artical it states that the eyes, nose and mouth are just rocks that make shadows. The sun was pointed at a certin angel to make it have this shadow type eyes, mouth and nose. The camera that they used for this picture was not in good quality, witched caused this to take a picture of this human like face because it wasnt pointed directly above this figure. Each pixle in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters dcompared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. So the first photo that the people see was not a good picture of it at all.

In my oppinion i do not think that this was created by aliens. I think that this was just an amaizing thing that the landform on Mars can create this wounderful face of a human. Some people might think otherwise but there is profe from the text that shows that this is not something that the aliens have made. I mean it might look liks something that aliens could have made, but i dont think that they could have made something that magnifasent. We dont understand how the land form is on Mars.

NASA was confident that it was a formation as well after posting it on their website they captioned "" A huge rock formation"" this shows that the majority of NASA believe this as well. I know no aliens know what we look like because we never seen any aliens orbiting or trying to take a photo. The way that I know aliens dont exist is because there are none that we've seen after years and years of study. In conclusion, I know that this wasnt made by any living thing and that it is a natural landform because aliens dont exist, they dont know what we look like, and NASA, who works on things like these every single day think it is a natural landform.",2,1,0.8813619017601013
9dcd73c,"The landform on Mars that looks like a face may seem like a momument created by aliens to some people, but it is actually just a mesa, which was uncovered by NASA's cameras on a cloudy day. An ancient alien civilization seems more than possible to some, but while it is a possibility, the landform on Mars is not an ancient civilization. Evidence of this is found on the image directly before the article, which shows the landform over time. More recent cameras have a better quality of capturing photos than previous ones, which is why NASA photographed the landform at different years. The landform on Mars is just a mesa, because it resembles natural rock formations on Earth and there is photo proof of it.

The face on Mars is just a mesa, because according to the article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa -- landforms common around the American West."" The article later states that the Martian landform resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho, which is a lava dome. The Martian landform is clearly a natural mesa, not an ancient civilization created by aliens, since it resembles occurances that are common in Earth's natural structure.

The Martian landform is a natural occuring rock formation, since there is photo proof of it and it looks identical to mesas, buttles, and lava domes on Earth. An ancient alien civilization may seem possible to some, and impossible to others, but the face on Mars is just a rock structure that is natural to the Martian landscape.

In paragraph twelve it says that the landform was common to the Middle Butte, which is on Earth. So, maybe the lava carried to Mars and created the same shape,which is probably at the same time .

In paragraph nine ,they said it wasn't an easy target to look at . Maybe, what they were looking at wasn't correct. They might've saw it wrong and just guessed what it was.

In paragragh one , the planet Cydonia

was two miles away from Mars .Maybe

Cydonia and Mars had once crashed into each other and created a weird shaped. Years later the shape wore off and created a human shaped face.

People can't prove that aliens made the Face ; they can't even prove that aliens are real. You can't assume anything until you know somthing about it . They may have all the picture and other details , but that doesn't answer anything. They don't have that fact of what really happened.

The Face of Mars is just something to keep people busy and on the edge of their seats . Even if it was real they wouldn't tell us . The Face was formed by posibbly by a collision or the lava like the Middle Butte .

9e1754d,"What would I say if I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, when I don't? I would first off say they're are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. The only evidence we have are pictures that people send in of ""UFOs"" or ""aliens"" being spotted. Seriously those pictures could be easily edited with the power of the internet.

The Face is just a natural landform! The Face, like many other landforms, looks (hince the name) like a face! Have you ever past by a hill, rock, or any other landform that kind of looks like a human or any other human part? If you have than you know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you start thinking ""why does it look ike that?"" or ""what if someone's body is buried there?"".

Although the Face looks like a face, it may have not been built by aliens. Like NASA said when they unveiled the image for everyone to see, it's just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."". The Face was just formed by shadows and your eyes playing a little trick on you.

We don't have enough evidence to prove that aliens created this, so it's much better if we stick to my idea. It's all the work of your eyes, shadows, and the form of the rock. If only we could go to Mars and figure out the truth. ",2,1,0.8381966948509216

The face is quite the story teller, and it will absolutely bring the attention to conspiracy theorists. But God is the creator of the universe, this could very well be some random thing that's just on Mars.

There are a lot of random items just like this all over Earth, things that make scientist believe that there is life on other planets-which could possibly be true-but these questions are unexplainable to science. God is the answer to all the questions we need to know. So this face on Mars, could simply be something very random.

The article expresses that the face is indeed false, and just an ordinary natural landform. Sometimes there are people who try to figure out how and why these kind of things happen, such as this face on Mars. but sometimes science can't answer these questions.      ",2,1,0.8186898231506348
9e2113a,"Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed ""Face on Mars"". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.

First and foremost, if these photos of the alleged face were the work of possible Martians, NASA would have found further evidence by now. Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface?

Additionally, even if NASA had found this further evidence, why would the company try to hide it? Not only would releasing such infrormation to the public leave NASA with all sorts of world renouned achievements, it would be more than beneficial for the company's financial standpoint. Releasing statements as big as signs of life on Mars would do wonders for the company. The more achievements, the more sponsors will see the potential in investing money in a program such as NASA. Adding to that, the more sponsors, the more projects NASA can fund, and by extension, the more the foundation will be able to learn and teach the public.

Probably the most obvious piece of evidence that busts the idea of unknown life, is that these photos were taken in 1976 (according to paragraph 5 of Unmasking the Face on Mars) . Technology at that time was still fairly primitive, especially for space travel. The photo just happened to be taken at the right time, at the right angle, by a pilgrim piece of technology. Further pictures, such as the ones taken in 2001, reveal that the ""face"" is just a mesa, with next to no details that resemble that of a human complextion. Think of it as the

""...Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho..."" (paragraph 12)

All in all, this ""face"" on Mars is no different from other conspiracies. Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the ""Bigfoot"" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest. Not only are they similar that way, but each one has been debunked with solid evidence. The face on Mars is simply a clump of rock, nothing to be even slightly concerned about. Unless, of course, you are an individual who likes to be concerned about clumps of rock.",5,1,0.8315718173980713
9e599a1,"Many people have heard of the ""Face"" of Mars. My friend and I were arguing about if it was ancient bona fide evidence of life on Mars, or a natural landform. We argued a bit, but he finally believed me after i told him the real facts. Here is my evidence of the ""Face"" being a natural landform.

Beggining with the first image ever uploaded on the ""Face"", many believed the ""Face"" to be some sort of alien artifact. NASA stated it was a rock formation, and this would be proved over a period of years. Firstly, when the picture was taken, scientist thought it could have been an ancient artifact, but then found out it was just a mesa, but with unusual shadows to give its appearance. This is stated in all of paragraph 2,

""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Next, much better photos were taken, almost 18 years after the original image! This is stated in this sentence, ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MArs Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.""

Finally, a final picture, taken in 2001, was the key to finishing the research and to prove it was just a mesa, beggining with ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" and is also stated in ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!.""

Nevertheless, the controversial photo was disproven. This shows how much a popular photo can become a question science can, or cannot, answer. So it is finally over and done with, the ""Face"" was actually a mesa with a shadow, taken at the perfect time to show a face.",3,1,0.9153735041618347
9e940ef,"I think the face on mars is a land form becasue. Only a few scientist thought it had something to do with aleins.

I tink it is a huge rock formation like said in the story. And I also think they said whatever they could just to have the chance for tax payers. To pay to help build the rocket or rover to get pictures of mars and study the surface. And I think it it was real it would be more detailed by maybe making hair eyebrow's or mustache. And standing up. And it is two miles lonf I dont think something would do that. And there is landfroms in the united states like the snake river of Idaho but we never mad that and it looks like a snake. A lave dome in a mesa is the same hight as the face of marrs also. And I dont think it would have a bunch oh holes on its forehead if it was made because usually things are made good and if they can fly a space ship to mars they have to be pretty smart. Other wise they would not be able to build it. And I alsp thought it was fake cause the other mountain by it.

So I physicaly think it would be inpossible to make soemthing that huge of a human. And I think there would be a giant hole around the face because were they needed the rock or whatever it is on mars to make the face. And its like a cloud kinda just because it looks like a bunny or dog dont mean someone made it look like one somethings just happen that way.

So my final opinion on this is that it is fake and noone could make this unless you had thoulsands and thoulsands of people.

There was no alien monument after all."" This part of the prompt tells that alot of people wanted to know what the faces were and they found out that the faces were natural landforms. This sentence also shows that they went out and found that it was a natural landform. That is just one of the reasons why i believe that the faces are natural landforms.

""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they are!""

NASA knew that if they were to put the ""huge rock formation"" on Mars they would attract a lot of attention. The were right! As soon as the huge rock formation was on Mars that's when NASA started getting all the attention NASA knew was coming.

Even after that. People stilll believe that perhaps the real alien monument was hidden by a wind since it was winter in the Red Planet. So, mission controllers are preparing to look again for some real eveidence. They said that it was a real hard work since they don´t pass around that particular alien statue look alike very often.

As they keep looking, they finally take the picture they wanted to take but it was not a good quality. ¨As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,¨ explains Garvin. Guess what they found? but before that, he also says that if there are any objects or anything on the planet, they will be able to see it by zooming it. When they actually study about the photo that they have taken, there is no such things as alien monument or anything extraordinary. Garvins expressed his thougts, ¨It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho,¨ and added, ¨That´s a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.¨

So, I hope you understand my point now that you know NASA have studied Mars over and over for a lot and a lot period of times and still, there are no alien discovery. If there are ever any alien discovery or something

extraordinary that NASA have found on Mars, or say any planet. It is most likely that we will want to share it to the public about it. No, we wouldn´t want to keep it a secret because we wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.  ",2,1,0.8155039548873901

Humans need food, water, and air to live, but that doesn't mean that aliens do. They could be like plants and create their own food inside their bodies. As for water, NASA has discovered that there used to be water on the moon, so what is there to believe there couldn't be any water anywhere else.

People can be very religious and about the Bible and God, but other people can be all about evolution and not creation. If humans evolved from animals, then we might not be the only ones. Which means that if humans can evolve into humans, then other organisms can evolve, also.

One explanation on to how this was formed could simply be the weather. Throughout the years of the world, many landforms be been formed due to the weather and nothing else. The text tells of how scientists flew over to where the Face is located and clearly stated that this Face was a natural landform and that there was no monument made be aliens after all.

From what I have read and heard about mars, there is no such thing as life on that planet. Many may argue that there is such thing as aliens on mars and that they did create or form this landform. The text states that due to the time of season, skeptics may believe that alien markings were hidden by the haze. Little do they realize that with the technology the scientists could make the photo bigger to see closer in to what the face looked like up close and the markings or anything that surround the area of the Face.

Have you ever seen the face on Mars? If so do you think it was a natural landform or alien made? So let's assume you think it is made by aliens and i think it wasnt. I think it wasnt because there have been things like this on earth but obviously not as big of a dent on earth. I personally think it was a natural thing like when clouds look like faces or random objects. People dont say clouds like that are made by aliens.

The reason I think it isnt alien made is because there are things on Earth comparable to the face on Mars. We don't think those are alien made. We also see clouds everday that look like faces or random objects so therefore there isnt a diffrence between the two. The only difference being clouds are in the sky and the face on Mars is on Mars.

Another thing you could also compare is the face on Mars to it the easter island heads. They are gigantic statues that kinda look like the face on Mars. A lot of people also say that those are alien made but other people could also argue they arent because they have an opinion. Most likely they will express there opinion too but it is a matter of opinion and no facts because there isnt way to tell if the face on Mars was made by aliens or not.

In paragraph 3 it talks about how the fce is just a natural landfor. Saying it is just a rock formation. Also it says that the shadows just give it the illoution of being a face. Which means the sun has cast shadows on the rocks and the way the rocks were formed it made the shadows fall in the wholes appering to be a face when it really isn't.

In paragraph 7 it says that there is no alien mounuments. Proving most theroy's wrong. They found this out by taking another photo with a better liense so they can soom in and see what is really there. By doing this they found no alie monuments and that it is just a land formation as NASA origonaly belived.

Also in paragraph 12 it says the face is equivilant to mesa or buttle. Which means that it is compare to mesa and buttle wich are both natural landforms on Earth. Also in this paragraph it was proven that the rocks were created by lava. So now it is considered a lava dome.

So over all scients now belive that it is just a natural landform and that there is no aliens ther and that there never was. Insted they say it is just a rock formation that was made out of lava. So it is now cocidered a lava dome. Also they say it is just like our natural landforms here on Earth.",3,1,0.8443176746368408
9f98b59,"The Face on Mars is most definitely something, just not what conspiracies say it is. It isn't some ancient alien artifact. Photos taken by satelites and other evidence shows that it is merely just a naturally formed mesa, much like the ones we see here on our own planet. It may be interesting to imagine that it's the reminants of an ancient civilization gone for thousands of years, but that reality will unfortunately end up staying in our heads.

The first images of the ghostly face, taken in nineteen seventy-six, were quite blurry. This is probably one reason that it has been mistaken as evidence of life on Mars. Another possible reason that it looked so human-like was because of the shadows the face was casting on to the Martian surface. The shadows blended together to create an even more obscured image. All of these things caused people to mistake the Face on Mars for something more than it really is.

The second time NASA took photos of the mysterious figure, the camera took them ten times sharper than the previous ones. This provided even clearer evidence that the face was actually just part of the rust-colored Martian landscape. Unfortunately, the pictures were take during a cloudy time of year for Mars, which in turn added a slight layer of haziness to the image. This cause theorists to says that the view of the markings made by the aliens was concealed by the heavy amount of clouds. I can't understand why skeptics would think this. It's pretty unreasonable in my opinion.

Some people even believe that NASA is hiding the true reality of the photographs from the rest of the world. My question to them is, why would NASA do that? If NASA really did find evidence of life on Mars, there would be no reason to hide it. In fact, it would be good for NASA. It would draw more attention to the organization and maybe more people would become interested in their findings. My point is that NASA would have nothing to hide.

The final images didn't have anything in them for conspiracy theorists to use against NASA's claims, finally putting the myths about the Face on Mars to rest. The images had extremely high clarity, better than any of the pictures taken before. These final photos proved that the face wasn't anything made by alien lifeforms, but just a regular mesa. The proof may have let some people down, but it has satisfied a lot of people, too.                    ",4,1,0.8695129752159119

9fc4dab,"The Face is a natural landform in Cydonia on Mars, it wasn't created by extraterrestrials. I can prove the Face is only a natural landform bescause there are similiar rock formations near Cydonia that show zero evidence of aliens, NASA hasn't been bringing in thousands of dollars from the discovery, and scientists discovered nothing strange about the rocks besides its resemblance to landforms common around the American West.

The article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", brought the fact that there are similiar rock formations near Cydonia that show absolutely no evidence of alien manufacturing to the reader's attention. This statement and fact proves that aliens did not create a face out of rock on Mars, let alone exist on Mars. The actual quote is, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Eygptian Pharaoh."" A few days after the discovery, NASA released the image to the public along with this statement: ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Also, if the Face was really formed by aliens, NASA would be getting thousands and thousands of dollars from the discovery that there are other beings that aren't living on Earth. The author of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" also brought up the counter-argument that the Face was indeed made by aliens. But then provided the reader with viable information that shuts down the counter-argument. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of NASA's budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

The last piece of evidence that proves the Face is just a land formation on Mars is that scientists discovered nothing out of the ordinary about the rock formations, besides the resemblance to land formations in the American West. After using a professional camera, scientists released this statement: ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" These reasons support the statement that the Face is only a land formation and wasn't created by aliens.",4,1,0.8935588002204895
9fced4b,"Have you heard of ""The Face On Mars""? If not then listen closely, the face is'nt real. It's just a Mesa that looked like a face back in 1976 cause of the technology back then. With today's technology we are able to see that it's just another landform on Mars.

The Face on Mars was a great mystery and a degree of surprise back in 1976 since they were just exploring mars at the time and didn't really know what to expect from it when they found that landform. Since then the Face became a pop icon and stared in multiple Hollywood films, magazines, and books. Because of the landform on Mars people thought that is was solide evience that life was on mars or that there was life on Mars. Thus aftward scienctists tried to take another picture of Cydonia (The Face) with the improved technology and show that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a landform on Mars.

In the image it did look more like a landform yet it still resembled a face so conspiarators still beleived that there was still life on mars or that there was life on Mars. The people that weren't saticfied said that The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April of 1998 which is a cloudy time on Mars. Thus the people also beleived that there could be alien markings but were hidden by the wispy clouds that the MGS couldn't see through.

Life on Mars is possible and the Face could be real and could have markings on it but because of the cloudy day the MGS couldn't see the Face clearly.

On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day had come and it was time to take a picture of the Face. The photo was taken with maximum resolution, and when people saw the picture there was no mistaking it for a landform on Mars. Garvin also added ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" said Gravin. So the Mar's Face was just a landform on Mars that looked like a face because of the technology back in 1976 and because of the cloudy day when NASA took the second picture of The Face.

9fe8c87,"A butte and a mesa these are all natural things on our planet Earth. So why do you think that the planet Mars also can't have these things. Earth is covered in these mesas so more than likely other planets including Mars probably have buttes and mesas, its just coincidentall that it looks like a face. With the other pictures it proves that the mesa isn't an alien artifact and just a natural landform.

If you go out to the Rocky Mountains and look around you can probably see tons of Mesas maybe not as big ,but they are still the same natural landform. The mesa is big and does look like a face at first glance ,but there is no way you can prove it. But for scientists you can back it up with facts not just opinions.

If you look at the image taken from the spaceship Viking 1 from 1976 you can see that only looks somewhat similar to a face. And then 22 years later a picture from a Mars Global surveyor you can see that it very clearly isn't a face and instead just a natural landform.

The only way that this could be an alien artifact is if the martians are inside of it or underneath it. That would explain how the camera can not see any other buildings around the object because they are all inside of it so no one is outside. They also could be inside of the butte because the planet is deadly for some paticular reason and they have shelter inside safely away. And another reason is because inside of the planet there may be some source of running water that is keeping them alive.

Although this could not work because they more than likely would have gotten a picture of a martian outside doing something. And they would need some source of water which has already dried up on the outside of the planet.

In the end it is not possible that the mesa is an alien artifact and is instead just a butte or a mesa that happens to like a face. Because the clearer picture shows that it now looks nothing like a face, water stopped flowing on the red planet a long time ago, and Earth also has these land forms all over the place.",3,1,0.7078737020492554
9ff5651,"I am here to tell you why I think the, ""Face on Mars"" is a myth or misunderstanding. The Viking 1 Space craft was circling the plantet when they spotted the resemblence of a face. Here are a few reasons why I think this ""Face"" is just a misconception.

The NASA crew had stumbled upon the image when they were orbiting their sister ship Viking 2 Spacecraft. They may have gotten a clear image of the ""Face"" but they hadn't known the conditions of the planet before they made the assumption of Martian activity. They plastered it all over the US not knowing if the ""Face"" was really evidence of alien life on planets; excluding Earth.

Garvin recognized the landform. He said it had looked like a butte or a mesa he had seen on earth. Who knows if the the landforms on earth can form on a different planet. Garvin said, and I quote, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Scienctists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. There have been ""buttes"" or ""mesas"" in the region of Cydonia before. I do not understand why this ""Face on Mars"" is any different if it was common in the region where it was found. The formation looked like a face. Okay well, sometimes you see random formations on the street with trash. You wouldn't give it a second glance. So, I don't know why this formation on Mars would be any different.

I believe that the formation is just different shadows coming together to make one big shadow. The brain can do crazy things, even trick you at times. I think the formation is just a mind trick that everyone fell for.               ",3,1,0.8756201267242432

I will be expaling the description of the face of the moon. Also how the face of the moon became famous. In conclusion the face of the moon was not made by aliens but made natural.

The paragrpah I'm writing will consest of the theroys of the face of the moon. The first theroy of the moon began when a camrea on board the MGS had to peer through a wispy cloud, and thought alien markings were hidden by haze. After the examination from labs they found out that the Martian face resembled a butte or mesa landform commonly found in the American West. The face of the moon represents a lava dome that has the form of a isolated mesa the same size of it. In conclusion the theroys are incorrect of the face of the moon.

This paragrpah will be explaining the face of the moons discovery. The face of the moon was discovered by Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft on May 24, 2001 when it spotted a shadowy figure of some what of a human face. When the face of the moon was examined at the Jet Propulsion Lab scientist figured out it was another Martian Mesa. After examing the face of the moon the authors resaoned a good way to attract public attenistion to Mars. In conclusion the face of the moon startled many scientist.

My paragraph will be demostrating the charactics the face of the moon has. The

face of the moon has a face like a human which is located in the center of the moon. Also the moon resemblise the nose, eyes, and mouth of a human. The face of the moon has a shodow that makes it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The face of the moon has many charactics that have followed its discovery.

This paragraph will talk about how the face of the moon became famous. It became famous by starting off as an illusion but then becoming a pop icon that has stared in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. People even think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. A few scientist belived the face of the moon was an alien artifact after examining the facts. In conclusion the face of the moon has made a big impact on fame.

In this paragrpah I will be describing the face of the moon. Nasa has done reasherch, and has figured out the face on the moon was not made by aliens. Also the theroys of the moon were proven wrong by experts concluding the face was made natural. Even after experts examined the pictures taking from the moon conclude it has similar charaistics to the human face. The illusion of the face of the moon has brought many attention to it making it a big event in fame espacalliy in Hollywood. In conclusion the theroys and facts behind the face of the moon prove that it was not made by aliens but made natural and is similar to a butta or mesa. ",3,1,0.7733113765716553

The face is two miles from end to end, and it has become a very big deal to everyone in the world. Cydonia is the name of the head. It had very weird shadows on the face, so it made it look even more like a face. This was a very good way to attract a lot of attention to mars. I believe that NASA wouldn't want any attraction to mars because they would want to find out things themselves.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took ten times sharper images than the first time. They thought that it would be an alien monument but it wasn't. What the picture actually shows is that it is equivalent to a buttle or mesa.

The Face on Mars was just natural and no one made it. It was just all Rock and shadows. No one believed it at first but it was just rock that came naturally. So it just turned out that the face was a rock with shadows.",2,1,0.8757243156433105
a0154df,"I do not see how you would think that it would be created by aliens I mean we have rocks, hills, and mountains. So there really is not different sure it may be weird that there is a structure on a planet that looks like a face. But we have weird structures that look like crosses and or objects. If you think it is made by aliens than I guess almost the whole earth is made by aliens. It's an object that is on a planet in our solar system.

For all we know there could be water and all sorts of things on Mars. There could be a whole nother life form on that planet. If so are you going to say they are aliens too. They may lok at us and say that we're aliens because they have never saw us before. For all we know that could have been a mound that people or animals lived in.

If you look carefully at the picture it looks like there are more than just that one mound. So there very well could be a whole nother life form we will never know. My opinion they're could be people on Mars. I mean there was another planet that a while back that we found out had some type of water type substance on it. So I think there are people on Mars.

Because if we can live on a planet that means there must be another one somewhere. Earth cannot be the only planet with water, trees, grass, sand, dirt, humans, and animals. This means we should look farther into this and maybe we wll find out if there really is any other life form. It very well could be an odd shaped mound or it could be a home. Think of it this way we have weird looking houses, hills, trees, and clouds.

So why don't you think that there is life on Mars. If we saw any weird looking space crafts or any type of alien equipment we would have let you know. So if you think that it is an alien creation explain why it would look like that. If I was to show you a odd shaped rock would you say it was created by aliens. So just think to yourself ""is this thing really made by aliens or am I just over thinking things"".

After you think about that does it really seem like it's created by aliens. But out of all seriousness there is no way that its made by aliens. The thing about it being made by aliens is why would they make it a human face on Mars. Don't you think that if they were trying to say something they would put it on the moon or something. I mean just think logically if they were wanting us to see something they would put it closer.

This is just an object on a planet. There are many objects on many different planets and I do not think they're made by aliens. If they were like I said they would be closer to us. But they are not close enough. Have you ever heard about the man in the moon.

So you are going to try and tell me that the man in the moon is an alien creation. No it is just a natural landform, nothing any different than what we have on earth. the moon has craters from asteroids, are the asteroids from aliens no they are just boulders that fall out of orbit.

The 'face' is just a natural landform because I can't even pick out the face, aliens are most likely not even real, and it looks like a natural build-up of sand or dirt.

I can't even see the face in 'the Face on Mars.' To me it looks like any normal pile of hardened dirt or sand. From what I can tell, this 'face' isn't even a face. It's more like when you see a crack in the sidewalk, and pick out a cool design, making it seem like something it's not, with your imagination.

Aliens probably don't even exist. No one has ever seen one, so why should we believe aliens created it at all? Even if it did just happen to be aliens, they probably weren't intelligent enough to create a 'face.'

The pile looks like a natural build up of sand or dirt. Stuff like that happens all the time with hardened dirt or sand, whether by accident or by choice. It doesn't make any sense at all, personally those are my thoughts.

Just because aliens haven't been found yet, doesn't mean they don't exist. While this is true, we also have NO evidence that aliens ARE real, therefore, this means there is a chance they still don't exist at all, which just as much chance that they do.

The face on Mars is probably just something that formed by accident, because there really is no point to it all, which brings us to the question, even if it was aliens, and it is a face, what reason would they have to do this?

¨In 2001 MGS (Mars Global Surveyo drew close enought for a second look at the so called face¨ said Unmasking the face on Mars. In 1976 a picture was taken of the ¨face¨ by NASA and yes it did look like a face but then again in 1998 the same picture was taken by MGS. By now the camras had gotten alot better and more sharpe. Then in 2001 MGS took a picture of the face and this time they new it was no longer a face it was a natural landform. Also in 1976 camras had 43 meters per pixel but in 2001 it was 1.56 meters per pixel. That is an amazing change.

If you look at the picture from 1976 the landform does look like a face but in the picture of 2001 you can tell the simalaritys in that landform to the one running right throw the west of the USA. You can esialy see the pikes and valleys and you can also she how the elevation changes. Im not sying aliens are not real but they did not create this landform.

My last reason for why this landform is natural and not created by aliens is because in the picture from 1976 you can see shadows. These shadows are from the pikes of the landform. Just like a normal mountain when looking at it from the top in the valleys you can see shadows. The shadows are what give off the face image.

I hope now you can understand why the face on Mars is not actually a face it is just a natural landform we know this becasue of pictures taken in 2001, simalaritys to real mountains, and the shadows on the landform.    ",3,1,0.8591019511222839

The first reason I think that the Face is just a landform because in the text it says that the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural land from. Also it said that there was no alien monument after all. That is proof that the Face on Mars is just a landform. Another piece of evidence that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform is it says in the text that,"" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view.""

After that hilarious day it was featured in many magazines, books, and etc. This is a enormous way of saying that this face is very engaging and concerning.

According to Mars Global Surveyor, they flew over Cydonia and snapped a picture of the original Viking photos. The pictures showed that it was an actual natural landform. It wasn't appeared to be an alien monument after all this researching. Even after this stage, people still weren't satisfied with the evidence that they had came up with.

The Face shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. After taking time and time again to review the face, it seems to just show a Martian that is equivalent to a butte or messa. "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, "" says Garvin. Which is a dome with lava that is in the form of a set apart messa, but is the same height of the Face.

As a result, the Face is a natural landform. It has a shadowy likeness of a human, it resembles the human head, and it shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. Research has shown that this isn't just an alien monument after all. There can be more thinking to this, can it? Its just a natural landform, which shows a Martian to represent Mars.

a1f25ca,"The ""Face on Mars""

may look like an alien has constructed it but the shadows of the bumps make it seem like it is an actual human face. If it were aliens who had built the Face on Mars, wouldn't there be more? The answer to that question would

be yes. The pictures from 2001 show that that the artifact was really just a natural creation. Before scientists had found the Face on Mars, the question is...just how old is it?

In the beginning of the aricle it states,""New high-resolution images and 3D alimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa"" (UTFONM, 1). Thus meaning that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. Before the pictures in 1976 and 98' were awful quality, the picture in 2001 shows exactly what the Face on Mars is. The article also stated that the Face on Mars,""...huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by the shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth"" (UTFONM, 1). This is proof of it only being a natural landform.

If aliens had created this form, wouldn't there be more of these human looking landforms. There is no evidence in the article that states aliens were the creatures who made the Face on Mars. If the Face on Mars was created by aliens, NASA would have wanted to research it instead of hiding it because they would've gotten paid. According to the article it states, "" Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" (UTFONM, 1). It would have been beneficial to NASA if it were made by aliens.

It makes sense to infer that it could only be a structure made by aliens because who knows the capabilities of these creatures. Although in the article it states,"" There was no alien monument after all "" (UTFONM, 1). There is solid evidence that the structer was not created by an extraterestrial creature. Even knowing it not being made by an alien, when was it created and how was it created? That answer we may never know.

In conclusion the landform found on Mars is not made by aliens. This was proven on April 5, 1988. The purpose of the article was to show people that the Face on Mars was just a natural monument. In the end of the article it states, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West"" (UTFONM, 1). We even have similar things like the Face on Mars on Earth. All in all the form on Mars was not created by any aliens of any sort. ",3,1,0.9095550775527954
a2095fd,"There are still some disputes about the true ""identity"" and origin of the Face on Mars. It is most likely just a natural landform, but some people disagree. Some people believe that it was created by aliens. However, since there is no legit proof of aliens even being real, how could you prove that they did this? NASA also has high-resolution photographs that make it pretty clear that it's just a natural landform. It may have taken several tries to collect all of the needed data to back this up, but the scientists did it so now we know.

As I briefly mentioned before, there is no proof of alien life actually existing. So, then, why are people convinced that it was aliens? Yes, it may have a strange shape, but that doesn't mean anything. There are strange shaped things here on Earth but people don't accuse it of being alien. Now, I do understand that this is in space, and on a different planet, but still; there are way more logical explanations. It's normal for there to be landforms on planets. That's simply the deal here.

The scientists also collected high-resolution photos of the Face. When the best photo was taken in 2001, it was made clear that this was just a landform, similar to some in the American West. It was just a formation that looked suspicious from far away. If you looked at the zoomed in picture, it just looks like a jumble of rocks. People just need to think realistically.

There is, however, a couple small reasons why people see a possibility of this being done by aliens. One of the pictures was taken from behind a small wispy cloud. This gave some people enough reason to believe that there could be alien markings hidden by the haze. Another reason people have for believing this is extraterrestrial work is that there have been some unexplainable sightings and findings that may point to alien life existing. There is no actual facts or proof, but enough has happened without logical explanations to convince certain people of this theory.

I respectfully refute these points. The idea of alien markings being hidden is a stretch. There was an even clear picture taken more recently that showed no alien markings. It proved that it was just a landform. There's really not that much more to it. In response to the few unexplainable things that may point to alien life, we have no way to tell what's really out there. If there is something, then it's doing a pretty good job of staying hidden, or undiscovered because we have no cold, hard proof of anything. For some things there are just no logical answers. There's always going to be something we don't know. It's probably the most reasonable to just stick to the facts we already have, and learn to accept the most likely stories. Yes, it's okay to believe or hope that there is something out there, but people should also realize that they need to think reasonably in certain matters, especially when there's proof, like in this case.

This is a very strong argument. There are many ways that a person could keep going on and on, explaining each detail to its full extent, but I think all the most important information has already been mentioned. People should accept the facts. There is always going to be someone who disagrees, but every argument is like that. There is way more proof pointing to the conclusion that the Face is just a landform. You might still think something different, but I think I've made it clear why I have so much reason to believe what I believe. ",5,1,0.8801095485687256

A couple days later NASA showed the picture for everyone to see. That's the support that the face is a natural landform.

a248338,"I've heard a great deal of conspiracieshaving to deal with the so called 'face' we at NASA found on Mars in '76. However, I would like to put these conspiracies to an end. When Viking 1 took the photo in 1976, I will admit it came as a kind if shock to us, we all soon figured it was nothing more than a common Martian mesa. And that's exactly what the 'face' was a common Martian mesa. The 'face' is simply a natrural landform; couldn't be any type of alien artifacts due to the following reasons: keeping alien life a secret would benefit NASA whatsoever, it was found in an area where Martian mesas are common, and we have recently taken photos with high-resolution to show that there aren't any buildings or other formations that could've been made by intelligent life.

Now most of you conspiracy theorists won't belive it, but I will explain how I got to this conclusion. The picture was taken around Cydonia, which is an area on Mars that Martian mesas are common to find. We've taken many pictures of these mesas around Cydonia to come to this conclusion.

Another reason the face on Mars is in fact a natural landform, is NASA hiding the fact that there is intelligent lifeforms on Mars wouldn't benefit NASA in any possible way. Finding life in the outer depths of space would be a tremendous accomplishment for NASA. Us finding liforms from entirely different planet would answer the biggest question of them all: Are we the only planet with life? If we'd found proof that we weren't alone we'd gain more funding for our space programs. with more funding we'd be closer to discovering more of the most unexplored area we know of: Space.

Finally, we have proof that it's only just a Martian mesa. Images taken in 2001 shows that there are no structures that could've been made by any intelligent lifeform.

Although the picture taken by Viking 1 didn't show us proof of life on Mars it did show us just how magnificent our universe really is. The 'face' on Mars was simply a natural landform made by nature itself. We have enough credible evidence to make the conclusion that the face on Mars isn't an alien landmark. artifact, or any sort of alien markings. We at NASA hope to one day find proof of other lifeforms in the deeper depths of space, but until then we will let the public know as of now we won't hid any information, such as the possibility of lifeforms from the public.

There are many statements in the article that show evidence that the ""face"" is a landform, and not an actual face. I think it is a natural landform. Others say differently than I do.

There is plenty of evidence proving the ""face"" is a natural landform. The text states that the picture is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A butte or mesa is a landform that is common around the American West. Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in thr Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa the same height as the ""Face on Mars."" This evidence proves that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.

Other reason I belive this becuase the passage states"" it is not a easy to target cydonia in facts its hard work."" My last reason is in the last paragraph , stating that it looks like a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of the moon . Let me explain my reasons for my beleifes .

My first reason is in paragraph 8 , it states ""The facw of mars is located 41 degress north cydonia lattitude where it was winter.""

Meaning it was winter, in winter theres very massivewinds odjects are going to fly around out in space . So to me an object hit mars when the winds were blowing . I didnt forget about the passage saying that the image resembles a huam . I mean this is outter space winds are very massive out there , more thatn likely winds just blew so much dust off of the area that those figuares appared .

Second reason falls in paragragh 9 stating that ""Its not easy to target cydonia in facts its hard w."" This is telling me that cydoia is hard to reach meaning it hard to get out there . That follows on my point because it cant be a human face its its hard to reach , human dont have the speicalised equiment we do , so how could the possibly find there way to make it out there , even if they did you would see no facel features , they would have to have on a helmis in order to breath out there. Also aliens to me are not as identical to us so I dont thing the shape would be so round resembling a human

My third and final reason is that paragragh 12 states that ""It looks like a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same height as the face on the moo."" I picked this reason because this is more reasonably that the alien canerio . Its already staing that its about the same size as the face on the moon . With all the winds that were happing this could possibly be right . its makes mor scence than the other topics because it adds up .

Thats why I say it's a natural land form . The winds , its hard work to get out there , and that lava dome takes the place of the shape that was on the moon . With my reasonds I just gave its makes scence , and sounds way more believeable that the aliens topic , because we dont even know if aliens are real or not .

a2b772a,"You think the face on Mars was formed by aliens? I could see why. Conspiracy theorists are everywhere. I am here to explain to you why you are wrong. You see, I have some very valuable information. If you have ever seen the ""Middle Buttle"", in the Snake River plain of Idaho, you would really see the resemblance towards the face of the moon and the Buttle. Though, this could just be coincidence.

For all of you out there who think that NASA is trying to hide information from you, if that was the case, you would not know about the face of mars. If we did in fact know if the face was crated by other life forms, aka ""aliens"", NASA would be blabbing it's mouth about it everywhere. That would make NASA'S popularity grow and be better for them all around, so why hide something that will help us?

This supposed face has brought along alot of good things, such as, starring in Hollywood films, appearing in books and magazines, and even being discussed on talk shows. With every good thing there is bad things, unfortuately. There are people saying NASA is hiding information and making up other wild conspiracy theories.

Though, this does not make sense considering when we first spotted the image of the face in 1976, we sexposed it to the world. I do not understand how that is hiding anything. Over the years, NASA has tried getting Viking 1 to get better images of the face, and succeeding. Viking 1 got better images in 1998 and 2001. The face is extermely hard to find, located on Cyndonia, you can only find it some days. Now when NASA spends so much time trying to get better images for the people, that sorta rings a bell, maybe saying there is no hdden information.

Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.

Us scientists at NASA have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", but since then we've been able to get better, higher-quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to ""landforms common around the American West"", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" here on Earth.

If that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states ""Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This isn't true. If NASA were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. As proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.

If you're still not convinced, look at the picture we took of The Face on April 5, 1998, ""when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time"". NASA got a picture ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"", as stated in paragraph 7. This means that it was much easier to see The Face, and what it actually was. The pictures revealed something amazing... the Face was ""a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I know, shocking! But these are just the facts. Some argued that is was cloudy that day on Mars, so ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", as it states in paragraph 8. So we took a better picture on April 8, 2001 - an uncloudy day on Mars - showing, again, that it was just a landform. Nothing more to it.

In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform on Mars, similar to those here on our home planet, Earth. As far as anyone knows, even NASA, there are no life-forms on Mars of any kind that made The Face. As it says in paragraph 12, the pictures we took on April 8 were so high-quality that """"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""" If there were any kind of aliens or alien markings on the Face, or creating the Face at that time, you would have been able to see it in that picture.

So what did the MGS do, then went back to check it out.

It was not an easy trip, but when they went back to take another photo they noticed something extraordinary.

Landforms such as this exist on Earth and high-quality images have been taken showing a normal landform on the surface of Mars.

One reason we know the Face was not created by aliens is because of it's similarities to landforms on earth. The Face is ""the Martian equivalent"" of landforms common to the American West called mesas. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, commented on the similarities. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The fact that the Face resembles a natural landform here on Earth supports the idea of the Face also being a natural landform.

Not only does the Face have similarities to natural landforms on Earth, higher quality pictures of it have been taken since 1976. In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia where the Face was located. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original image"".

I still don't believe aliens was the cause of this unique landform.

First off, I don't believe in aliens and second, even if they do or did exist how could they create such a creative landform?

If aliens do exist, how would they know what a human looks like? I believe it is just an illusion.

Many weird, unique, creative landforms are found around Earth that weren't human made, so just because there is a unique landform on Mars we believe aliens formed the landfrom? I believe scientists and other people this to start rumors or just want everyone to believe people say this to get a rise out of every one else.

I do not believe that the face is there, because a alien or some sort of creature was forming the face. i believe that the face is like that, because rock evolve over years and we all know how rocks on earth evolve and become into small rocks or a big rock it depends if the rock is not grtting dirt or something else added on to the rock. So i believe that the face is actually a rock settled into the plant and is now evolving into a face. ",2,1,0.7803272008895874
a35725b,"Many people believe that "" the Face"" on Mars is actually a alien of some sort or a human. I can truly convince you why it's not a alien, it's only a landform. I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform.

First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back.

Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts. Many would say that the aliens didn't want us to knw they exist but the article states it could have been a person going to Mars. Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars.

Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory. They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there. Some sort of creature may have made it and they would give us evidencce of life on Mars.

You never really know if there may be some sort of living organim on Mars unless you study it closer. Either I may be correct and it just being a landscape made from a storm or I could be wrong and its a living organism. We will never know unless we do the research.      ",3,1,0.8819267153739929
a365054,"If I'm imaging myself to be a scientist at NASA dicussing the FACE with someone who thinks it was created by aliens because why would the moon have faces on it and plus humans can't be out in outter space without an space suit beacuse they can die within seconds.

And if I have some scientist partners that trust me and believe what I'm saying because anything or anyone could of done this for fun..

It just takes time to figure out whats going on, on the moon. And figure out that something has to doing this and make it look like us people/scientist at NASA look crazy. By saying that there's a FACE on the moon. Who wants to believe that soemone has made a FACE on the moon by these past years. But I know we people/scientist of NASA will figure out what it might be causing these marks/ FACE's on the moon. And no one can say anything about whats happening beacuse they don't know the truth and how do we know or donn't know that if someone is trying to make us look stupid and make it look like something or someone has been on that moon marking it?

One of the things is that I'm still kinda confused on is how or what could of done this and why? Why would somebody or something do this to our moon? And if they did it to our moon to just mess around and make fun of us for thinking that it was something real or ""ALIENS"" that I don't believe in for some reason. But i just don't think it could be aliens beacuse they are not real. Plus I've seen a real and real evidence from the internet or anywhere else and there's no proof.

And another reason why I think that it couldn't be anything alive is that they couldn't survive a ""second"" out in space. And maybe it could've been the moon itself. What I mean by that is that the moon can just form it itself and created just a peron FACE or just have been something else that no one could or would ever identify. Even if they try so hard to do. It still wouldn't work. Maybe it's just how the landform just creates in space. Like maybe the other plantes have something in coomon and do the same thing but no one could ever notice.",1,1,0.6455152630805969
a367504,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it tells us about a ""face"" that was found by a NASA Viking 1 spacecraft. Many may belive this ""face"" was created by aliens on Mars. However I will prove to you using text evidence that this so called ""face"" was actually just a landform.

In this artice on May 24, 1976 a NASA spacecraft was circling Mars searching for a place for the Viking 2 to land on the planet when it came across a landform that looked like a face. However, it could not have been a face due to the low quality of a picture the blurryness made the image look like it had shadows that gave the face a nose, a mouth, and some eyes. In order for NASA to prove to the Americans that this was not a landform created by aliens on Mars they took another picture in 1998. By looking at this picture and another picture from 2001 in these higher quality pictures

it does not look like a face at all.

Another reason other than physical evidence, is the fact that NASA would not lie about life on Mars. If the U.S. found physical evidence of life form on any other planet than Earth they would most definetly spread the news. Finding life on other planets would be a huge accomplishment and a very exciting thing. One landform from a blurry photo that looks like a face will not prove there is life on Mars.

""It's not an easy target Cyndonia,' says Garvin.'In fact it's hard work."" A quote from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". Why would NASA put in hard work to prove that the landform was not an artifact made by aliens? Because its not an alien made artifact. They took time and a lot of money to see if it was just a landform so they made absoute 100% sure it was just a landform so that they didnt waste money on chance.

In order for aliens to be able to survive on Mars, they would have to have food, water, plants, and shelter. All of these things Mars does not have. How is an alien supposed to survive without the natural resources it needs to live? How would an alien even be able to make a huge artifact on mars without any tools?

In conclusion, the landform found on mars was indeed not made by aliens. They have picture proof, if they actually found evidence for life on Mars they would tell the world,they spent lots of money making sure it was just a landform, and Mars doesn't have the resources that an alien would need to survive. If NASA ever finds life on Mars they will tell us but for now Mars is a big empty planet.",4,1,0.9190484285354614
a36a079,"In 1976, a remarkable natural landform was discovered on Mars, a land form known now as, The Face. Scientist have debated on whether The Face is a natural landform or created by an ancient civilization on Mars. I believe this is really just a natural landform, and the reason I believe this is because of recent evidence. Reasons why I support this are, in 1976 picture quality wasn't as advanced as it is today and, this rock formation is similar to ones that occur on Earth.

The Face, a huge rock formation, at nearly two miles long. This face like formation is also known as Cydonia. Cydonia in the mid 70's was thought to be a strange landform built by aliens. Although, really it's like any other naturally occuring landform on Earth. According to the artical ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" In the new updated picture of The Face, it is clearly seen as a land formation, not done by aliens.

Then in 1976 picture of Cydonia was not as advanced as it is today. In the 2001 pictures, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo."" This quote from paragraph 10 explains that, the picture power was very noticable different in the photograph from 1976 than 2001. This means that the pictures from 1976 are not reliable because of the poor pixel quality. Proving that The Face is just a natural landform.

On April 5th, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor traveled to Mars and flew over Cydonia for the first time. These photos were said to be ""...ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,"" according to the artical.

So on that day in 1998 people tuned in to find out the real truth. A quote from paragraph 7 in the artical states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitng when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform."" In the end, it turns out that there was really no alien monuments.

In conclusion, my claim is that The Face is just a naturally occuring landform. First, are Earth landforms that are similar, called mesas. Next, pictures took in 1976, are outdated and have poor pixel quality. Lastly, since April 5th, 1998 there are pictures proving that The Face is just a natural landform. Therefore making my claim true, The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform.",3,1,0.8401778340339661

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time to see if they could get another shot of the ""Face"". Sure enough one man snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photos from the Vikings. When the image appeared on a JPL website many were shocked to find it was only a natural landform, there was no alien monument after all.

After all the searching for more information on the ""Face on Mars"" scientists yet again in April of the year of 2001 drew close enough for another look! Michael Malin and his team captured an amazing, unbelievable photo using a camera with maximum resolution. When examining the photo, they found that the picture actually shows it is ""the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.""

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is only a natural landform and most certainly did not come from aliens. Thanks to the new and improved technology today, scientists were able to find out that the ""Face"" was only a landform which is even common on Earth. ",3,1,0.8816957473754883

Its says that there must have been a Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on mars thas when the scientist figured out that it just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.only thing is that it made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh a few days later NASA unvieled the image for all to see. Caption noted a ''huge rock formation''... which resembles a human head ..... formed by shadows giving all illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth''. The author reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars.while discussing it with one of the the scientist it was very strange because alliens kept getting brought up in our conversation its was all seeming very strange to me.Then i finally discovered that what if its was brought down by alliens strange feeling i kept getting i didnt really want to believe what the scientist was saying to me abut the alliens.That next day i couldnt queit think well bout alliens was gettting brought up back to back in our conversation.

After all that we talked about it was just a natural landform silly me thinking what if alliens did bring it down but that couldnt seem true.my adive is that if u think something is strange and unusal discover it first you might find out all the information on it.Always keep in mind is you discover something and find out the truth you get a better feeling about yourself and other thing too.",2,1,0.7852327823638916

I am really going towards why it is much more like a natural landform than it is a alien. I mean it could be possible, but I'm edging towards the more realistic view point.

Ok so the artical clearly states that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photos. When the picture was analized it was proven to be a landform NOT a alien monument. Of course the stuburn ones wanted to believe the opposite,because that's what they do. So they looked again for the the sake of proven the hard to belive ones wrong. They got an even better picture this time, but found more information. The martian is equivalent of butte or mesa which are landforms common in the American West.

a3e37e8,"It's come to my attention that more and more people everyday seem to believe that the Face is created by aliens. Unfortunatley,as cool as it would be, it was not. The face is simply just a natural landform with shadows casting down on it making it look as if it has a face. Everyone has just been seeing this information in magazines and on T.V. and believeing it is true,but they never seem to believe the truth that it is not a Face created by aliens. This is common for this planet to create natural landforms as well.

Most people just believe it is created by aliens because they hear information from thier friends or they see it on T.V. or see it in magazines. The truth is most of these things do not even have enough evidence to prove what they are saying. They just believe it is true because it is intresting. They do not even have the proof that aliens exist,and as cool as it may seem, it is just not true. I know some people will come to their senses and realize what they are saying when they say that they believe aliens exist and people just look at them like they are stupid.

We have no other evidence as well that aliens exist,which means we pretty much have to believe that it is a natural landfrom,which it is. I know most people will stick to thier belief that aliens are real and that they created the Face,but they are not real and they didn't. I know I may make some people upset by stating the facts but Im just telling the truth. Having no other evidence leads us to believe it is just a normal natural landform with shadows. I do not blame those of you that believe it was created by aliens,it sounds cool right? But Im sorry to be the bear of bad news, but it is also the truth.

These landforms are common on this planet as well.

It is not unusual for these landforms to occur. It is just the certain shape that sees to have cought everyone's attention. The shape itself is not what created the Face but in fact it was just the shadows that made it look as if it had,had the shape and form of a face as we humans have. This natural landform is known as a mesa,which you may have heard of before. The point is,these types of things happening on this planet is very common.

I believe myself that it is just a natural landform beacuse I know that we do not have enough evidence to prove that it was anything else. I also believe it is just a natural landform/mesa because I know these things are common on this planet. So don't just going around telling people aliens exist before you get the actual facts. If there were further eveidence leading to make us believe there were aliens it would be fine. We just don't have that extra information or evidence.

a3e45a7,"The Face of Mars. What a discovery! This geological wonder on Mars has been very famous since its discovery in 1976. Its been seen in films, magazines, books, even at grocery stores. It's so popular that some people wonder how it came to be. One popular theory is that the Face was made by aliens, or martians if you will. I believe that theory is absurd. There are so many reasons to show that this was not made by some form of a living being.

First off, if this was made by an organism, then where r they? Why did they leave? What was their reason for making this face? Why isn't it more detailed if the beings that made this were intentionally making a face? It just doesn't add up. Besides, even if it was made by someone, wouldn't we have found some residue of civilization? When ever someone, or something, leaves a place there is always a geological hint that they were there.

That's why I believe that it was naturally made. It's not that hard to believe, actually. There are some of those naturally made landmarks here on Earth as well. For example, there was a winter in Colorado where a mountain had snow on it's side in the form of a ""Y"". There is also Eagle Lake in Michigan. Why is it called Eagle Lake? Because it looks like an eagle from above. So I have no doubt that this ""Face on Mars"" is naturually made. It was not made some alien civilization.",3,1,0.8859891891479492
a3f6028,"I am a NASA scientist and you don't believe the evidence we have. You just want to believe that they were created by aliens. Really? I feel like we, at NASA, have all the evidence to prove to you non-believers that the Face was not created by aliens, but only appears to be a face because of the pictures you have seen. We have beeter pictures and I am going to prove to you, that the Face was not created by aliens.

I am going to tell you why the Face isn't created by aliens, but is just a rock. First, the Face is made out to be a face because of the picture taken in 1976 by one of NASA's spacecrafts,Viking 1. It was a picture taken by accident while Viking 1 was searching for its sister ship, Viking 2. It was taking pictures of possible landing sites for Viking 2. So, the picture was taken by accident, with not the best camera that was available. It might have been the best one at the time but better cameras were developed over time. Second, when the mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab recieved these photos on their moniters they must have been surprised but they soon figured that it was just another Martian mesa, because it was common around Cydonia, only the mesa had unusual shadows to make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Lastly, few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, so getting photographs became a main priority for NASA, about eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. So, when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it gather a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. So for those non-believers of factual evidence, the picture was revealed to actually be a natural landform. Which is why the so called Face that was created by aliens, was not created by them after all.

If you don't believe me still I'm pretty sure that I have showed you all of the evidence that proves you wrong. You could try to say that the second picture was still not close enough and it was cloudy. Well, the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look, and the third picture taken in 2001 had each pixel that spaned 1.56 meters compared to the Vikings 43 meters per pixel. I have presented all the evidence to prove to you that the Face was not created by aliens but is just like a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. I am right.

This explains how the face is really but from a far distance it's not what you think.

Even on websites, it shows just a normal landform. Something could look different from far away, then up close. Like in the story a group of people went in 1997, and they said it looked like it was an alien artifact. But a year later in1998, it was sharper then that passed year when they took the first picture.

This explains that the ""Face"" is really not a face, and that it wasn't created by aliens. It was just a simple rock with some shadows reflecting or illusions on the rock to make it look like a face. It was just a regular landform. ",3,1,0.8825960159301758
a45d6d9,"First off, I would like to tell you that we have conducted a series of research to prove that aliens did not make this structure, it was just a naturally formed structure. When we first took the picture with the spaceship, Viking 1, we didn't have the best camera strength that we used to take the last picture. This led all of us to believe that it was a face on Mars, and almost everyone sought to it that is was a sign of life on Mars. Soon we just figured out it was another Martian mesa on Mar's surface, nothing special.

When you look at that first picture we took, I could understand that you would believe that it was made by alien life. After slaving over all of the research we had done to prove it wasn't and released it to the press, you still believe it was aliens? Just to make people more happy with the news, NASA snapped another picture with the Mars Global Surveyor. It showed that it was just another NATURAL land form. There was no alien moniment to show. Though not everyone was satasfied with the results.

When they took that photo, The Faces on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. This is a cloudy time of a year on the Red Planet. So people wanted to have a clearer image since the picture had to be taken through a layer of clouds. Finding the Face on Mars wasn't an easy job, but we found it again and snapped a thrid picture in April of 2001. This certain picture showed that it was just another Mesa.

So in conclusion, would you now still believe that this is an alien made structure. After all the research, would you still think that it was a alien made structure? Looking at the photos clearly show that it has only bumps that project the shadows that made the Face on Mars to look like just that, a face. ",4,1,0.8705689907073975
a48576c,"Mars is a very interesting planet with many marvelous sites. It is even called the Red Planet thanks to its bright red hue. Also, Mars has a region called Cydonia. This region contains the popular ""Face on Mars"". The Face is believed to be an alien artifact.

In 1976, scientists discovered one of the biggest wonders in the world ... ""the Face on Mars"". This happened during one of Viking 1 missions to look for a landing site for his sister ship, Viking 2. Scientists guessed it to be another ""Martian messa"", which was common in the region of Cydonia. After unveiling the image to all people, ""to attract attention to Mars"", many people believed that it was evidence for life on the Red Planet. Some people even said that "" the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide"" but, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"", which shows that NASA would actually benefit from an alien life form so they had no reason to hide it from the world.

There are many facts that help support the fact that there is no alien life form on Mars. For example, in 1998: the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of the Face on Mars, which was ten times sharper than the Viking photos, that revealed the ""Face"" to actually be a natural landform. Still not all people believed, so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a second look of the Face. The picture was taken by a camera in which, ""each pixel in the image spanned 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The picture taken by this camera ended up showing a ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" and not a face built by an alien civilization. In conclusion, you could still believe there to be aliens on Mars, but you would just be ignoring the facts that the scientist of NASA have presented in their photos of Mars from the years 1998 and 2001.

a4c3f8e,"Have you ever wondered about natural formations? You would think that someone or something had to help form it, right? As a NASA scientist, I'm here to tell you that these strange, yet amazing things can happen on there own. There are some people that do not believe in natural landforms in other planets.

In 1976, an image from a satellite-related object took a photograph of a piece of Mars. In the image, there was a piece of land which appeared to look much like a human face. Once NASA reveiled the shocking news, Many people did not believe them. Humans thought that aliens were the ones who contrusted such a thing.

NASA has more than enough facts and evidence to prove that it was made naturally. The article says ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This means that the landform was made by natural occurances. The landform is natural. The passage also says ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavealing... a natural landform. This means that there was no alien monument after all."" There is much more proof of this landform being natural than there is being made by aliens.

Others say, that aliens made this formation. The article states that ""Conspiracy theorists say that the Face is evidence that NASA would rather hide."" The thing that they do not realize is the fact that they have no proof of NASA ""making up"" a story like this. Theorists have not studied the landform as much as we have. How can people think that the Face is created by aliens when theres absolutely no proof of their existance?

Making up fake stories for publicity is extremely wrong. If theres no evidence of something being fake, than just belive that it is real. Theres more to the world than people think and believe.         ",3,1,0.7496495246887207
a4dd622,"Everyone thinks that the ""Face"" on Mars was actually created by aliens, but that sounds crazy. Sorry everyone, but actually, it's just a landform. You may not believe it right now. It's true though. I'm here to tell you how it is not created by aliens.

In 1976, NASA took a ""MGS image"" and people who saw it, thought it was a face. People also thought it was created by aliens, but it wasn't. A few days after NASA had the picture, they let everyone see it and according to the article, the caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The Face was just a rock that was not formed by aliens.

People may think it is formed by aliens because, how else would it get there? Or, why would it just randomly look like that? Although the picture does show a human-like face in the structure, they took another picture in 1998 showing that it is just a landform. Also, in the article, a man named Garvin states that he has saw similar landforms that look like the Face around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" If there are similar things on Earth, it has to be a landform.

I'm going to make this clear that it is just a landform. In 1998, an MGS flew onto Mars again and took another picture. According to the article, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" In 2001, NASA also sent another MGS to Mars, still no alien monument, just a landform. Even when the Face was a popular trend, defenders of the NASA budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, but there wasn't.

I hope this information helped people understand that it is just a landform. I didn't mean to crush anyone's hopes and dreams, but it's just proof, and science! It's crazy, isn't it? That something that seems so real, just isn't. It's still nice to know that Mars has some kind of a development with nature.

Soon enough, a little yellow bus pulled into the parking lot. Five children came tumbling out, all excited to see what is indoors. ""Asher, stop it!"", a little brown haired girl yelled. As soon as they were all out, the stood in a straight line, covering their eyes from the sun while looking at the huge building. I look the children's faces. I only know one child, because another said his name.

""Welcome to NASA. We are so very glad you guys could come. Please, let me introduce myself. I am Maddie, and I will be showing you around today. Follow me inside, so we can get out of this dreadful heat!"", I say. The five children come chasing after me, and their teacher tells them to slow down. One by one, the children enter the building, fascinated by all the pictures hanging from the walls. Asher asks, ""Are aliens really real?"". As I go to respond, the little brown haired girl says, ""Of course not. That's just in movies. I want to know about the Face on Mars."". I was stunned she knew about that, because it was just recently added on NASA's walls.

I give her a puzzled look and respond, ""We have not found any form of life on Mars, or anywhere for that matter, excluding Earth. As I was saying, the Face on Mars in a natural landform which means that it happened naturally. It was not made by any aliens"". The girl looked at me, frusterated, and said, ""Prove it.""

The elevator door opens and the children come swarming out, running up to the pictures of the Face. I say, ""Here, it says that the Face is a ""huge rock formation"", so that means that when the universe was created, so was that rock. That rock is just shaped like a head."". All of a sudden, the young girl smiled and said, ""Oh, I can't wait to tell my sister that she was wrong!""

The children wrote everything I told them down in their notebooks. Shortly, we had to part and say goodbye. The kids all came up and hugged me, saying that they were thankful for getting chosen to come. They piled back into the bus this time, instead of piling out. I waved goodbye as they set off.

In conclusion, the kids all realized that the Face, is just a natural landform, made when Mars was created or after. The children know that still to this day, we are looking all over the universe to find something new and exciting to share with them. I am so gald that they could come and experience this with us.

a507ced,"Aliens and natural lanforms are both explanations to describe the Face on Mars. Some people believe that the Face was made by marsians or ""aliens"", but then there are also some that believe it is a natural landform. But I have information to prove that it's just a natural lanform.

Twenty five years ago, NASA had took a photo of what looked like a human face. A couple of days later NASA released the photo the the public and people started to describe it as ""Face on Mars"". On April 5, 1998, Micheal Malin and his MOC took a photo that was 10 times sharper than the oringinal. That showed to prove that it is anatural landform.

Some may beleive that the Face on Mars was created by alien, but there is proof that shows it is just a natural landmark. There is probably still scientist out there researching to find better proof. But it all comes down to what do you believe?   ",2,1,0.8972543478012085
a52306b,"The Face on Mars is very interesting. For many years people have thought it was aliend created. But our photographs clearly show the Face on Mars is not alien created because we have the best cameras we could get, but in 1998 they had the best cameras they could get but they were very weak, and the Face is a natural landform.

In 1998 the cameras they had were very weak they weren't like are cameras today. They are only fourty three meters per pixel which is not a lot. The cameras also captured shadows, so that interfeared with the picture and could make it look like something else. Also the cameras were weak and not very strong.

The Face on Mars is also just a natural landform, formed by the winds and rocks and the planet moving. It's also a big rock which is in the shape of an oval which is probably why people think it was alien created. Also the shadows were there because of how weak the cameras were in 1998. The landform the rock formation is called is a mesa.

Also in 2001 we had way better cameras than in 1998. Are cameras were stronger. They also had less pixels per frame. The pixels per frame were 1.56 which is great. The camera also zoomed in and could see the Face on Mars close up. The camera also took a nice clear photo rather than the one in 1998.

Because our photographs show you that the Face on Mars is a mesa. We concluded that it is not an alien created face. The image can clearly show you how it looks and that there is no face at all.         ",3,1,0.852929949760437
a5254a8,"In 1976 Viking 1 snapped a photo of Mars. Viking 1 spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. Many people think it was created by the life on Mars. Many people think that it is just a natural landform. There was no alien creation after all. I am going to tell you why this is just a natural landform created on Mars.

First, Michael Malin and his MOC took a picture of the ""face"" and claimed it to be just a natural landform. The picture was more clear than the orginal 1976 photograph. When NASA got a good shot at the ""face"" they rused out there to the Red planet to get a good shot. Jim Garvin said, ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a god shot at it."" And it was revealed that it is a natural landmark.

On April 8th, 2001 Cydonia became cloudless. And it was easy for NASA to see the mysterious face. NASA took a picture ""3 times bigger than the pixel size."" So if there was an object like a airplane on the surface of Mars, you would be able to see what the object was. Turns out that the picture showed a butte or mesa.

""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,"" says Garvin. The mysterious face turned out to be a butte. Not a Alien artifact. Each pixel in the 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters. compared to 43 meters per pixel in the Viking 1 photo. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" said Garvin.

NASA is apart of the Government. The Government lies all the time. So that kinda makes people think that NASA is lying about the ""Face"" being a natural landmark. The Government and NASA are keeping secrets in Area 51. So they must be keeping this whole ""Face"" thing secret too. That it's not a butte or a mesa. But that it was created by life on Mars.

In conclusion, NASA still hasn't prooved that there is life in Space. But does this ""Face"" landmark proove that there is? We just have to wait and find out. This is a story that has been going around for decades. And it is still unsolved. NASA recently found ice caps on other planets. And claimed that there was water on Mars but it evaporated, casusing the huge valleys and canyons on Mars. ",3,1,0.8823837041854858

Back in 1976 I got my first glipse at the figure on the surface it made me think it was alien until the Mars Rover proved it could not possibly be made by aliens.

When we first released the piture it set the world on fire as much talk about the face on Mars it made us look like we made the discovery of a life times work we all shared the cridit for finding the face. Nasa became the biggest hit around some took advantage to that some did not others did.

Allthough we proved it to be a natullary formed crater by using the Mars rover. Even after this a group of them left because they belived aliens were real and belived aliens created this monumentail artfact which would change space to how we know it to be today.

Mars did look like it had small shacks which they thought was house arfound the massive rock. Mars has a very rocky layer on its top it gives Mars the ability to have craters which from a distance look like shacks.

The one thing the told me is what I can't explain it to this day I have no respouce to it they said do you see the crocked grim on its face every time we look at this figure it has a differt face which is hard to explain.

I'll tell you what I told him though is that you can never underesitmate the force of gravity. Gravity pull masses on to that face of Mars shaping differantly every time.

As conclusion the belivers in aliens started a foundation. The foundation was called alien were here. They could not prove that they were right so they foundation had to swith to make more sense to have an resonable idea the new foundation also died off. The new foundation has The Brithish were here which everone new so they had no purpose they ended up giving up on any chance of company.

The rock maybe have laded and make or had a face shape from the way it landed. Im not so sure if it had landed like that to make a face shape. That's what I am thinking, is that it was like that from the way it had moved or it had changed. Some pople are surprised that they haved found a human face in the or in a planet. I know its kinda wierd but u never know what could happen.

They say it had a human face. They say it had eyes and it had a nose and it had a mouth in the face. They should be scared because what if it was aliens that did that and that made the face.

I work for NASA and I have have found pictures about a face on Mars and through my perpectives I believe that its an alien on the surface on Mars. The reason why I believe this is an alien because the face is an absolute landform of an alien. These photos were taken 1976, 1998 and 2001. In 2001 the face evolted more like a face of what humans it was of humans but I've been doing research that these faces are from aliens.

Although it does look like a human face theres no body connected to it unless the body is stuck underneath the surface of the planet, but through my research I insist it's an alien. I do not have proof it is one but theres no proof of it being a human either. When the Mars Orbiter Camera went around Mars the face still had no evidence if it was either a human face or an alien artifact.

In my case I still prove this to be an alien. We've done plenty of research and nothing has been found is it is a human face or an alien. My question is if that it was a human why wouldn't have we known it was a human if it died. Where'd the rest of their body go?

In paragraph 6 of the article line 2 state ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" Line 3 states ""There was no alien monument after all.""

As exciting as it would be to discover living beings on mars, there is no evidnece today that would support that theory. Here at NASA, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years. The Face could not have been created by aliens because there are no alien markings and there are landforms very similar to the Face here on Earth.

When analyzing a digital image, you can dicern things 3 times larger than the actual pixel size. If aliens had created the Face, there would be some kind of marking that the aliens would have made. On our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute maximum resolution. The images that we took showed no sign of any martian markings. This proves that aliens could not have created the Face on Mars.

Here on Earth we have many different types of landforms. One of which looks very similar to the Face on Mars. This landform is called a Mesa. These landforms here weren't created by living beings. They were created by natural causes, like erosion. So, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on Mars have been made by creatures? There is no evidence that proves the Face could have been created by alien life forms.

There is no acurate way to say that there is life forms but if there were other life forms and the government isn't just hidding things, then we would have found out about it by now. When the picture was taken it could have just been cloudy and maybe the rock formation has been there for awhile. ""'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size.'""

This face or figure that we say we see isn't really that at all. For instance a car doesn't have a face but yet you could easily imagine it having one. If we see two slits and a larger one below it, to us, this resembles a face. This figure juts from it's frame because over time things change. The mars dust or sand could just as easily have been blown by wind and formed this ""creation"".

In this article,""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.'"" The plain in Idaho could be natural and so why can't this ""face"" be natural. There is nothing wrong with nature's beauty giving us questions and allowing us to make accusations.

a65cf4d,"Do Aliens Really Exist?

Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens? Well, I think the face is just a natural landorm. They're isn't that much evidence that proves aliens creating this unknown face. People think just because it looks like a face means its a sign of life. However, they're is enough evidence to prove that this tremendous unknown face is just a natural landform.

First, NASA said the face looks like a sign of life but figured it was just a another Martian mesa, because stuff like this is common. But the face's unusual shadows made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. Later on, NASA unveiled the image with a caption noted ""Huge rock formation which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars with the Face.

Second, in paragraph 7, it says when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. After all, there was no alien monument or any sign of life. People were still not satisfied, it says in the text. However, some people just need to face the facts when it comes to disappointment.

Lastly, another reason to prove that the unknown mask is just a natural landform. In paragraph 12 the author says what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. Then says"" Reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Finally, Gavin also says ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars. "" Which means they go through the same process to be created-landform.

However, their is a possibility that there are aliens on mars. The face on Mars does have eyes, nose, and mouth. Which makes the formation look like a human face. In paragraph 8, the author says that if the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face, alien markings must've been hidden by the Haze. However, there's not enough evidence to prove this sign of life on Mars.

Finally, after all, there is enough evidence to prove that the face is just a natural landform. Their are also many other reasons to prove this correct. Aliens do not exist on Mars. Maybe NASA will find more evidence to prove there is life on Mars but right now there isn't enough to prove that. The bottom line is that there is no sign of life on Mars.

The picture looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. The head in the picture was enormous. We figured that the face was nearly 2 miles from end to end. Some time later after studying and researching the picture, we leaked the picture to the public so they could give us there thoughts about it because NASA always likes to here from the people. As soon as the picture was public lots of people where saying that it looked like it was created by aliens. It was attracting lots of people. But a big percentage of those people said it looked like an aliens face which was a Huge rock formation but they kept defending their statement. But i want to make people believe NASA hat it was a Rock formation created by erosion and rock movement through out the years.

Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so. The reason why i dont think this face was created by aliens is because just like on earth there is erosion,rocks,and plaitonic movement. On Mars there is that to, the only three things Mars dosen't have is oxygen, water, or any subtance of food or plants that make oxygen. The exprience at NASA over the years and the studying and researching every day and having to do expriments on the picture, have determine that those figures are caused by rock movement or metiorids that hit planet Mars. The thing is that no one really could of created that without any food or water.

The people that think the natural landform was created by alliens need to join NASA so they can come along see that NASA brings only the truth noting but the truth to the people.

We have been doing this for quite a while now, and in 1976 we got our first picture of a ""Face"" on Mars. We call it the Face because it has formal structures that look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. We were very curious about this structure, so we decided to send the surveyor back to get another perspective. We got our second picture in 1998, which came out more clear and looked more like a face. In 2001 we went back for a final time, and we have concluded that this form that looks like a Face is nothing more that just a natural landform.

You may not believe me when I say this, but trust me, my job at NASA is not only performing tests, but also to put the results into a viewers' perspective. Around 40 years ago, we recieved a funny photo of what looked like a Face, however, technology wasn't too strong back then. With all the tools that we use today, we were able to hypothesize that the Face is just a Martian mesa. A martian mesa is a huge rock formation, it just so happens that this rock had shadows around it giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

To prove this hypothesis correct, we sent out the Mars Global Surveyor to snap pictures that were ten times sharper that the original photos taken of the Face. After observing these photos, we concluded that the Face is just a simple natural landform, and there was no life on Mars and no alien monument after all. Conspiracy theorists did not believe the tests as they were taken on a cold winter day, they said aliens may have been ""hibernating"". So again on April 8, 2001, we went back and took another shot.

I think that it is scary having planets have faces on them. these Faces were found in 1976 and it was hard to see and in 1998 and in 2001 the face got covered by sand and dust and you couldnt see it anymore. in 1976 there was a group called the Viking 1 sent by NASA. They had found a 2nd face made and it had shadows in its eyes, and mouth.

There was a big time when everyone kept talking about these faces in magazines, in social media, and in abandoned stores. ""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in holltwood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery stores.""(5)

Some people say that these faces are awesome and that NASA should go on the planet Mars and explore the faces on Mars. This finding was very important to tax payers.

NASA had sent a 3rd space mission in April 5, 1998 when the space ship had passed over Cydonia the took a picture of the face. It is very hard to find this face because it was under a cloud on Mars. When the space ship took a picture there wasnt anything at all because they were in the wrong are of the planet. When the space ship got to the right place it was hidden but it was in the same place. People think that aliens had put a Haze over the face so the peoploe couldnt see it anymore. ""The camera on board MGs had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. perhaps, said skeptics, Alien markings were hidden by haze.(8)

No one has ever seen these Faces again so maybe they were hidden by some or somthing. Hopefully soon NASA will send another space trip to try to find these Faces again.

a73365c,"Alien Theory: Debunked

There may be evidence as to why people believe in something as comical as aliens; mass UFO sightings, various reports of alien abduction, passages in religious books and scrolls that show odd evidence of a species not born on Earth, or even on manmade structures such as the ancient pyramids or Egypt. However, we still haven't found credible evidence that aliens are real. The Face is not some sort of bona fide of evidence on life on Mars that NASA would hide. The Face is merely just a natural landform.

After the discovery of the Face, NASA unveiled the image for the public to see. A caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."" Authors who knew about it reasoned that it would be a good way to engage the public's attraction to Mars, which it successfully did. The pharaoh look-alike of the mesa was named ""The Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Many conspiray theorists said that NASA was just hiding more from the public since they said it was only a natural landform. Aliens and ancient civilization became a wide belief, even scientists believed in this. But due to this, the Face became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997; 18 years after the Viking missions ended. The chief scientist for NASA's MArs Exploration Program, Jim Garvin said ""We felt this was important to taxpayers.""

When NASA's Viking 1 caught a picture of the Face while it was simply finding a region for its Viking 2 to land, mission controllers may have been amazed or mildly frightened to see this on their monitors. This discovery was short lived because scientists such as myself figured it as just another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia, a region on Mars where the Viking spotted the legendary Face. The first photos had bad quality, the best photo having 43 meters per pixel. On April 5, 1998, the MGS flew over Cydonia for the frist time, Micahel Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. Those who have grown curious to this discovery were upset to only see that THe Face really was only a natural landform. Howver that day they took the photos was a cloudy day on Mars. And so, more disappointment was caused when on April 8, 2001-a cloudless day on Cydonia-MGS took another chance and took another photo. The pixels in the latest image spans 1.56 meters, which is much more better than the original photos from the Viking.

As a rule of thumb, that picture quality would capture more landforms or manmade structures if there were any, but there were not. The latest picture shows the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of the Middle BUtte in the Snake River Plain of IDaho,"" says Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes for of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. However, Mars doesn't have life on it. That planet is labeled dead to some scientists.

Though there may be some instance of some alien life form out there, such as the Wow Signal, there isn't enough credible evidence that the Face was made by aliens. As I have already said, landforms such as that MArtian mesa are common on Cydonia. This one just happened to look like a face due to the shadows casted onto it.

Living in the universe alone or with unknown species out there is terrifying, but without enough credible evidence, aliens don't really exist. They're jsut a pigment of imagination caused by the odd funtions of the human brain. All of those alien abductions were most likely hallucination from drug use pr mental diseases. With all of these factors, the alien theory with the Face is debunked.    ",4,1,0.8679959177970886

The people still believed it still had something to do with the aliens because of where it was located. The Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, giving them a reason to believe it was an alien artifact.

The Face on Mars was finally unmasked. Everyone found out the truth and dealt with it, even though most weren't satified about it. The Face on Mars is a natural landform and has nothing to do with aliens.",3,1,0.8828580379486084

This is where the name ""The Face on Mars"" comes from. Some people think it was from aleins, other think it was just a natural land form.

If i were a scientist at NASA and I had to convince them that the "" Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens i would simply say that there is no evidence that shows aliens where around.

The arictle "" Unmasking the Face on Mars"" states that on April 5th, 1998 Micheal Milan and his Mars Orbiter Camera team tookphotographs of the object which clearly revealed that the "" face "" was a natural landform.

Although people werent satified with the therory that the ""Face on Mars""is just a natural landform, it is the only conclusion that really makes sense. If aliens made this the spacecraft orbiting mars would have been able to see them. And another thing there would have been signs to prove aliens made this landmark, but there isnt.

a7ba001,"There has been an argument saying that the face on mars is a ancient civilization. Well they are wrong because it is an old landform. My three reasons of why it is a landform is because the planet Mars cannot support life. Also because it is just the lighting forming the eyes nose and the mouth and it is just a landform. I know it is a landform that has just eroded over hundreds of years.

On Mars there is no oxygen no water or life that is because the planet cannot support life. The planet is compleltly dead. If there was a civlization then they would of had to of built a house with airlocks just to survive. Even if the Aliens did not need air to breath they would have gotten to hot and they need mosture to survive. And you would think that we would have found a civilization or something that would have kept them alive by now. In the text it says it would be cool if there was an ancient civilization.

The landform looks like it has eyes a nose and a mouth but really it is just the lighting reflecting on the landform. If the sun is hitting the landform then it will cause a shadow to creat the look of eyes a nose and a mouth. But after many years the landform has eroded to form a face like look. Sense the planet Mars has allways been the closest to the sun. It is alot hotter than earth so there is allways heat waves so that is what caused the erosen on the landform. In the text it states that the eyes nose and mouth are just an illusion.

This is a landform because the planet is completly dead. Mars cannot support life because it is too hot and it gets heat waves. Also the light refelects off the landform and creats a shadow of eyes a nose and a mouth. The landform has had many years to erode. In the text it states it is just a martian mesa common enough around Cydonia. Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

It would be cool if there was aliens that created the landform. We could see how they adapted to surviving on the planet and its harsh conditions. They might help us addapt to Mars and we can help them adapt to our planet. But NASA would become more famous than what it is today. Because they would want to have all the land marks for artifacts and it would probably make the aliens mad.

The landform on Mars was not created by aliens because we would have known by now. Also because Mars cannot support life the lighting on the planet creats the eyes the nose and the mouth like a illusion. And for all we know it is just a landform. I know it is just a landform that has eroded over hundreds of years. ",4,1,0.7629998326301575

many way that the face on Mars could have been made but aliens is not one of them. I have some information that will prove first there are no aliens and that the face on mars wasn't made by them.

First of all the face on mars is just what is sound like, a form in mars' land that looks like a face. It was first seen in 1976 by NASA's high-resolution images and 3D altimerty. In 1998-2001 it has gone though some major changes. It is a odd thing indeed.

I beleive the was just a huge rock formation. This was not make by aliens. We humans have not fount any finint prove of aliens. So fromma sciences stand point i belevie that this is just a rock that looks like a face.

In conclution i think that

this was not make by aliens. For now we humans have yet to find prove that alien are real. So by science this is just a rock formation not thw work of aliens   ",2,1,0.8816785216331482
a7e1ea2,"Have you ever wanted to be apart of NASA or a scientist? Scientist get to explore many parts of the world, even outer space. Have you ever wanted to travel to Mars known as the, ""Red Planet?"" Mars has a long history, however some NASA scientists say that in 1967 they saw a face on Mars and some people thought that aliens created it.

Twenty-Five years ago from this date May 24, 2001 a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars taking pictures of possible landings for the sister ship named Viking 2. As the spacecraft was circling around the planet Mars, it saw something very odd which was, shadowy likeness of a human face with and enorumous head nearly two miles from the end it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on the red planet called Cydoina. Soon scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, however this one had unsusual shadows which made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

As NASA looks at the images the caption said ""huge rock formation."" The Mars then started to reveal images of a face such as the, eyes, nose, and mouth. Mars has now became a famous planet. The planet Mars has starred in Hollwood flims, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a haunted grocery story checkout line.

The agurment now is weither or not the face was made by aliens and the answer is NO. In passage seven, it says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orgional Viking photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landfrom. There was NO alien monument after all.

I believe if I was in the NASA or if I were a scientist I would use passage seven to back my answer up. It gives all the details about why the aliens did not make the face on the planet Mars.

We could argue and argue about this subject but if I was a scientist I would make a camera that could go farther and depper into mars outmasphere so we could see what was going on for some days to mounths to see what would happen if nothing happend then I would be right if we seen aliens there then he would be right.

But it would be alot easyer said then done to make that camera that can go that far into space to see that much for that long it would not be a easy task. But for the sack of seeing if aliens were real then it would be worth making to see if aliens are real or not. Because that would change every thing that we now about a different life force then use. It would blow up I would become famus nowing im the one that made the camera.

But I would also be famous if i was the one that found out that it was just a big joke and it was realy just like sand and rock. So there would not be a big comspeisy of it. And not even that i would prove that guy in the lab wrong that it is not even aliens that it is just sand and rock.

But It would be pretty cool to see aliens and we only seen this way back in 1976 I wonder how long it has been there it could be billions to only 40 years old. But i would get to work to see if i could build the camera to send to mars and see what was going on on mars. And if I was to build it and if it would work I would keep it there on mars untill it ran out of battries and if there was yto be nothing then I would be right but if there was to besomething then that guy from the lab would of been right.

But that is what i woud do if I was a sientist that worked for NASA abd there was a big argument about what it was then that is what I would do to see just make a camera to see which one was right me or the guy in the lab.

The image was taken with a 3D altimetry. Aliens are not real the are just things people beleived are real. Also it is dissappearing over the years.

The image that is called the face of mars is really a mesa. NASA's viking 1 was circling the planets for sites. When viking number 2 spotted the figuer.

The face is made from rocks. Rocks like from Mars. The face is just a natural landform nothing else. Since the Face is made from Rocks and is on Mars it is called a mesa. Its basically a huge rock formation eveyone would say, even I would say it. There might have been an ancient civillization there, but we are still finding out new stuff everyday.

Yes the face has been a pop icon. It has appeared in many books, magazines even radio talk shows. Some people even think that it is possible that there is somehow life there on Mars.

You shouldn't believe that aliens really did make the face. We don't have any proof that aliens are even real. So we can't say that aliens made the face.

Our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist. Even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this.

Our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this. They would not be able to calculate the right measurments and angles also. Plus we dont think they would be able to survive on Mars because of the conditions that are there. These aliens would just have to be out right smart to do something like this. This is just one of those things that seem impossible for an alien to do.

The third and final reason is the point we are trying to get across to you guys and that is that we think is just a natural land form that formed while the planet was being created. If we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this? We do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is. We think that it was a land form God decided to give the planet.

To wrap up everything about this mysterious face maybe it was created by aliens but we may never know because this face is on a planet where a human would not be able to live and survive to witness the aliens build it. The only people that might have got a chance to witness it is atrounauts that would have been up in space at the time.

""Unmasking the Face on Mars""

there's alot of confusion or argument over the face being an alien artifact or landform. The face on mars is indeed a landform.

First, NASA, who discovered the landform, releaed the picture with the caption ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head. The authors thought it was an great way to bring attention to mars. Therfore contributing to the cofusion of the landform. Then, Micheal Malin and his team captured a photograph of the landform ten times better than the original authoers. ThIs photo revealed proof the face was a landform. Not everyone was saticfied so he set out for another photo. Finally, in 2001, Malin captured a photo using maximum resolution and each pixel neing 1.56 meters making the image three times bigger. The photo shows what looks to be a natural landform. this landform would be compared to Earths and Snake River Plain of Idaho.

In finding out the face was a landform , some conspiracy therist still believe the face is alien artifact. Onthe other hand defenders wish there was acually ancient alien civilization on Mars.",2,1,0.9029988050460815

Photographing the rock formation was a huge priority for NASA. Some scientists say that aliens didn't make it because they don't exist. They decided that it was another Martian mesa which were common around Cydonia.

A few days after, NASA unveiled the image for all people to see. When they released the photo, the caption was ""huge rock formation."" Some of the scientists say that the rock formation looks like a face. They said ""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" An author later decided that the Face would be a great way to get the public's attention and attract them to Mars.

After the Face was released to the public, it became a pop icon around the world. the Face appeared in Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. In the passage it says, ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" This is evidence that NASA wanted to hide from the public. Some say that the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. Garvin says, ""we had to roll the spaccraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field view."" He also said, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" In 2001 each pixel spans 1.56 meters. compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Even though the scientists did not find out if it was alien who made the rocck formation or not, they tried very hard to try and find out. People are saying that the formation looks like the Martian form of butte or mesa. Other people ae saying they look like other landforms around the world.

it's not.Technically, you really can't say it is from an alien life form because scientists and astronauts haven't found evidence of life on Mars yet.Conspiracy theorists say NASA is trying to hide the truth from us when actually they want you to know the truth.Otherwise, if they didn't want you to know the truth they wouldn't have put the picture out in the first place.There are a lot of statistics and facts that obviously point to the truth and I'm going to explain all of them to you.First,the other and newer pictures, the obvius comparison to landforms on Earth, and why your brain thinks it sees a face.

First of all, it's obvoiusly not a face because the newer pictures ,that were taken of the same thing show a different thing.You might wonder, how can it show a different thing but still be the same thing?Well, the newest picture,from 2001, was taken with a much better camera.So, the picture is clearer and so is the fact that this is a natural landform.Finally, the pictures are the most important clue that the face is a natural landform.That is how the pictures tell that the face is a landform.

Secondly, if you compare landforms on Earth to the face pictures you'll get similar pictures.For example, if you take a picture of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho from above and compare it to the 2001 picture they'll look identical.That is according to cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.He stated that, the face reminds him the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.Finally, when and if you get the chance you should compare the face to other landforms on Earth.That is how comparing landforms on Earth,to the face can provide evidence to you that the face is a natural landform.

Lastly, your brain somewhat tricks you into seeing a face,but don't worry because it's natural.When you look at the first picture, you're most likely going to see a face, even I see a face.So, we kind of get excited about discovering another life form, and we start to jump to conclusions.Don't think there is something wrong with that because there is not, as long as you have evidence to support it,but in this case,you don't.Furthermore, the reason are brain 'tricks' us into seeing a face is in our DNA.For example,from when you were born everytime you looked in the mirror or looked at somebody else, you saw a face.The reason why you always see a face is because our brain has been ''hard-wired'' to recognize a face.That is how our brains trick us into seeing a face.

To conclude, those are all the clues/reasons why your brain sees and thinks the first picture is a face when it's actually a natural landform called a mesa.To recap, the comparison of the first picture to the 2001 picture can show that it's a mesa. Next, the comparison of landforms on Earth to the face can show you it's a mesa.Those are clues that can prove to you that the face is a mesa. So basically, all you have to do is compare different things to the face.Finally, the reason why your brain tricks you into seeing a face instead of a mesa is because everybody's brain has been 'hard-wired' to recognize a face.So that is why when you look at the first picture you see a face instead of what it really is, a mesa.Finally, sometimes all you have to do to find the truth is dig and look deeper and you'll discover the truth.That is why I say the face in the first picture is actually, indeed a mesa.",4,1,0.8443799018859863
a915d97,"On May 24, 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars while taking photos of possible landing sites. As it was taking photos, it noticed a dome that resembled a human face. The face was nearly two miles in diameter and it appearded to be staring back at the cameras from an area of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some say that this is evidence of life on Mars.

In paragraph 2, they tell us that the sensation was short lived. It also says that scientists assumed it was just another Martian Mesa because it was so common around Cydonia. This one had shadows that made is look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. They should not have came to the conclusion that there is life on mars only becuase they saw shadows that resembled a humans facial structure.

In paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998,

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took photos that would come out 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument. If there really was an alien monument to begin with, it surely would have appeared the second time around, especially because they used a much better camera.

In paragraph 12, it says that the picture actually shows a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. Garvin states that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The Face on Mars is most likely a natural landform. Martian mesas are common around the Cydonia area so it could have easily been mistaken for what appeared to be a human face. They claim to have seen evidence of life based on shadows that appeared on a natural landform. This seems very unrealistic. Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team took photos using a camera that would leave pictures 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking pictures, so if anything was actually on Mars, we surely would have seen it.

NASA made the picture of the Face public, and the people believed that

the Face was bona fide evidence of life on Mars. The people said that NASA was hiding the fact with conspiracy theories. If NASA would've found lifes on Mars, they would've told the people. It will benefit NASA since that will make them the first to find life on Mars. It also says in paragraph five, ""...Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars.""

On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Miichael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took the picture of the Face ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. The people was disappointed with the result. The Face was nothing but just a natural landform.

Since not everyone was satisfied with the result, mission controllers prepared to look again. It was difficult since the region, where the Face was located at, was cloudy. Finally, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. They used camera's absolute maximum resolution to take the picture. In this image you can discern things three times bigger than the pixel size, so you can see any object on the Face. The result was no different. It was just a Martian equivalent of butte or mesa.

This is why the picture Viking 1 took isn't any evidence for life on Mars. NASA didn't hide anything from the people, or make up any theories. If you take a closer look at the Face located in Cydonia, you can tell it is nothing but just another Martian mesa, which is common in Cydonia.",2,1,0.8535072803497314
a952a62,"I think that the face on Mars is definitely just a natural landform. It doesn't really look like a face to me at all anyways. All i can see is the nose. Of course, some people actually see the entire face, and a lot of those people believe that it was created by aliens. They believe that there is life on Mars that NASA is hiding from us.

If NASA did find life on Mars, it would benefit them a lot. It would be stupid for them to keep it a secret for so long. The face on Mars clearly looks like a human's face. If there was life on Mars, they would look nothing like humans, so therefore, they wouldn't know what a human's face looks like anyways. Just like all of the different life forms on Earth. We look completely different than most animals we've discovered. The only animal we look even close to are monkeys, and even then, our faces look much different. The aliens would also have to be smarter than most humans to fly into space, and to build a giant landform that looks just like a human face. If these aliens DID have the equipment to fly into space, then they almost definitely would have found Earth by now, and no scientist

has ever actually caught an alien on Earth before.

In conclusion, If aliens were smart enough to build their own landform, then we would have definitely known by now. NASA has absolutely no reason to hide this kind of information from us, and anyone who thinks so should do some really deep thinking about it. We should trust NASA when they say that it's just a natural landform which happens to resemble a face.                                              ",4,1,0.872246265411377

First off, when the Face was discovered, it was a surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when it appeared on their monitors. However, the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. Martian mesas are also quite common around Cydonia, the region where them Face was discovered. Although photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA, very few scientists actually believed that the Fce was an alien artifact. On Aprril 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking 1 photos. When the first image appeared on a JPL web site, it rtevealed nothing but a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

Since not everyone was satisfied with the images taken by the Mars Orbiter Camera team, because of it being the cloudy winter season on Mars, on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" Jim Garvin says, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center of the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. The same article also claims that even after all of that work, the picture actually shows the Martain equivalent to a butte or mesa.

Finally, buttes and mesas are not only common in Cydonia, but also common in the American West, disproving that the Face was was created by aliens. In the article mentioned before, Jim Garvin states that the Face reminds him of the Middle Butte and the Snake River Plain in Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Ultimately, with all of the research scientists have done on the Face, all of the images taken, and the evidence shown, you can clearly see that the Face is not an alien monument, but only natural landform that just happens to have an odd shape.",4,1,0.8874362707138062
a988abc,"I would first remind them that when the face on Mars was first shown in a picture, we did not have the greatest technology. This tells us that we cannot assume any thing in the picture to be definite because things may be blurred. This is not a major point to go on, but it is just the beginning.

Next, I would explain that messas are very common on Mars and that the shadows are the only factor that are actually giving an illusion of a face. This strays from from their belief that the face on Mars was created or planted there.

After that, I would simply point out that clearer pictures and better evidence have proven the face on Mars to be ""a huge rock formation....formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Such as the many movies aout the face on Mars pointing the attention to aliens to gain more supporters and the good ratings from the audience. It is basically science fiction. They only provide a perspective from which the human mind can comprehend imagination. Imagining is good, but not with false hope. Books, magazines, and talk shows will do the same thing for similar reasonS. And other propositions from ordinary people for this face on Mars have surely been made over the last twenty-five years.

The picture from the Viking in 1976 was not clear and had 43 meters per pixal. Now in 2016 43 meters per pixal is like anchent to us. In 1998, NASA's Mars Global surveyor (MGS)

took another photogragh of the Face. The picture was a little more clear but NASA still couldn't tell forsure that the Face was a natural landform.

a9ea38e,"The ""face"" on Mars has become something of an controversy since an image of it was released back in 1976. The fact that people to this day believe it is still something created by ancient alien life bewilders NASA. Conspiracy theorists have concoted thousands of theories relating to NASA withholding information about extra-terrestrial life from the general public. None of which, have ever been proven, and/or ever had any solid evidence to back them up. Therefore, the face on mars is not the result of extra terrestrial life, but more of the result of hundreds of years of weathering and shaping.

As stated above, many conspiracy theorists believe that the ""face"" on Mars is the result of an utterly alien civilization. That is just not true. They accuse NASA of trying to hide it, yet, there is no evidence to support this. The discovery of an ancient alien civilization would greatly benefit NASA. The amount of funding and support they would recieve would be massive. Those within NASA's ranks that believe there is extra-terrestrial life out in space would have reached their lifelong goal of discovering it. There would be a huge incline of investors and programs willing to support and back-up NASA in all their endevours. Therefore, if NASA concluded that this ""face,"" was the creation of an ancient alien civilization, they would have no reason to put their finding out there into the public, without stating what they believed it truly is.

Another piece of evidence for the ""face"" just being a naturally formed feature, such as a butte or a mesa, is probably the most obvious fact. If NASA didn't want people to know about it, they would not have had it published for the general public's viewing. If NASA didn't want people to know that they had found evidence of an alien civilization, would they publish it and try to get people to believe that it was a natural formation? Of course not! It would have been a lot simpler to withhold the image and keep it secret rather than publish it. People make mistakes, but such a large government company such as NASA would have thought a little bit more before they published a picture they didn't want out there.

Finally, the last piece of evidence is another obvious one. Back in the 1970's, we did not have the sort of technology we have nowadays. The cameras were not as sharp and nowhere near the amount of pixels today's photography equipment has. The ""face"" was photographed twice more after the original image surfaced in 1976. The first picture was very blurry and was the main reason that people belived it was that of an alien civilization. In the original photograph, each pixel spanned about 43 meters, versus 2001's 1.56 meters. The second picture taken was a lot less blurry, and was taken in 1998. It showed a lot more and a allowed for almost no question that it wasn't what NASA said it was. People were not convinced, due to the fact that it was taken during a cloudy season on Mars, and was said to have obscured markings that might have led to it being identified as alien. The last picture was taken in 2001. There is no question with this picture. It clearly shows a natural landform with no strange markings and/or features.

The face on mars is not the result of extra terrestrial life, but more of the result of hundreds of years of weathering and shaping. After years of doubt, it is quite obvious that Mars' ""face"" is simply a natural formation.

a9fc13b,"Revealing the Face

Have you ever heard of the ""Face on Mars""? Well I have. I'm actually a scientist that works for NASA. As a scientist we are constantly getting information from people about their thoughts on the Face on Mars. We get many suggestions, such as the face being created by aliens. Well as a scientist I'm here to tell you it was not created by aliens.

This face on Mars was not created by aliens, but was created by nature itself. The Face on Mars is a natural landform. I know this because as a scientist of NASA we believe this face is just a huge rock formation. This rock resembles a human head. The human head formed by shadows, giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and lastly a mouth. Many authors that have researched on this topic believe it will attract more attention to planet Mars.

The Face on Mars has became a very big deal. It has played a role in movies, showed up in magazine articles, and has been a topic on radio talk shows. Many people have come to conclusion that NASA would rather hid information about this such thing. But NASA just wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

Many people still believe that this artifact came for aliens, but few scientist and have come to believe this is true. NASA takes pictures of the Face on Mars but many aren't satisfied by the quality of the pictures. As a scientist at NASA it is very challenging to capture a good photo because this face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude. This means that the camera has to peer through many wispy clouds to catch the face.

We scientist at NASA have come to conclusion that this Face on Mars isn't created by aliens because of those reasons. Although many others may disagree and believe NASA is hiding information on this artifact. As a scientist that works for NASA, we will continue to look more into this specific topic and hopefully be able to know for a fact that this is created by landform and not aliens.

aa22161,"The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.

The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.

Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.

The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",4,1,0.8985951542854309

It could be the sign we need to find out if there is life on Mars. A lot of people are saying it is a face, while others do think it is just a natural landform. There have also been pictures captured from 1998 and 2001. This face has became a pop icon, it has appeared in Hollywood films, magazines, books, and even radio talk shows! Although there has been quite a few reasons to think it is a face I personally think it's just a natural landform. Now yes, I do have many reasons for my thinking. In these next couple paragraphs I will state my reasons.

One of my firsts reasons for thiking it is a natural landform is that there are many landforms naturally made just like that around Earth. So if they are natural landforms on Earth they would probably be natural landforms on the planet Mars. In the article Garvin says, "" it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

My second reason would be that it sorda resembles a face but not really. Theres a very high chance that could just be a mountain and the shadows resemble the eyes, nose, and mouth. As you can see in the picture from 2001 it almost doesnt even look like a face. It is more like a mountain of some sorts there. If you do look at the 1976 photo from distance it does resemble a face, but as the camera quality improved over time it does not look as much like a face anymore.

Another reason is that it is very very unlikely that bthere is an imprint of a face on the planet of Mars. Even if it was though it would basicaly always look the same and not change looks like it has. Now a natural landform will change looks over time. It will rott or decompose and stuff. Which in my opinion it has decayed somewhat. It definintaly has not stayed the same, because all 3 pictures have a significant difference to them. That could be rom better camera and technology quality. To me though it seems as if the better quality makes it look less like a face.

Now though I have a few more reasons this will be my final reason. This ""Face of Mars"" is the some of the only proof we have to think that there is life on Mars. So it makes me more and more right. It is just very unlikely or maybe even impossible for that to be a face. It is not unlikely that it is a natural landform though.

I do realize there are many reasons why I am wrong and why it is a face but I think it is a natural landform. So in conclusion It is more likely for this , Face of Mars, to be a natural lanforn than for it to be a face.                ",4,1,0.8665401935577393
ab18f69,"Is there really life on Mars? This question was asked by millions in 1976. A face was detected by Viking 1, a spacecraft, when it was gathering pictures and information for another landing spot on Cydonia. But is this really an alien? After NASA has collected other information and pictures, it is certain that the Face is just a natural landform.

The Face is a mesa, which is a common land feature on Mars. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (p.2)."" The shadows and poor camera quality had made the mesa look like a face. ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA...(p.6)"" Though, most scientists didn't believe that it was really an alien artifact they still were going to prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. Photographing Cydonia became a new priotity.

When scientists went back to get more pictures they still found the same answer, only more certain. It is not an alien artifact. The pictures they captured only make it more clear that it isn't. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the firts time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos (p.7)."" After, the new picture was taken, not all were satisfied. So, NASA went back out to Cydonia to capture another shot. This time, each pixel captured 1.56 meters, which is very detailed. There is no way the picture could have been misinterpretted. The Face is just a natural landform.

Opposers say that this information is bona fide evidence. ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ""These people think that NASA is just trying to hide it from them. This is not true. ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars (p. 5)."" If NASA hopes to find life on other planets, why would they hide it? ""But not everyone was satified (p.8)."" NASA has went back to Cydonia three different times, and the thought that it is just a mesa has gotten more certain each time. The ""ten times sharper"" camera proves that is just a natural landform. Some may say that NASA is not trying hard enough to figure it out. ""We don't just pass over the Face very often (p.9)"" ""In fact, it's hard work (p.9)."" As you can tell, targeting Cydonia is not very easy, and NASA still got three shots just to prove them wrong.

The Face is just a natural landform. It is not an alien artifact, and if you don't believe me by now you aren't using logic. NASA worked hard to get the three pictures that reveal the Face. It is a mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Any landform can have shadows that look like a face, this one just happened to be on Mars, where we are looking for life. ",4,1,0.8679587841033936
ab1dd33,"I belive that ths face is a natural landform. I belive this because, on May 24. 2001. on that day go back 25 years. NASA we went around the planet taking pictures. Then we spoted the face! We had to know more, it was two miles end to end. It was Viking 1 that took the first photo of this face, in 1976.

I know this is just a natural landform because, we took a close rlook at this face. We found out that, it was a huge rock formation. Which just seemed to look like a head. then the shadows that makes it seem like there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Which are all caracterstics of human face. The public thought different though. They are the ones who made the mars face so popular. It appered in hollywood films. This face also made apperences in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. The public thought it was alien life on mars.

While the public and other scientists thought this face was bona fide evidence on mars. We as in NASA say its just a natural landform. But we do wish there was life on mars.

We still tried to get more and more photos of this face. In Sept. 1997, we thought it was important for tax payers to find out if this was just a natural cause, or life on mars. A couple years later on April 5, 1998. We got another picture of this face, this picture was ten times sharper the the first photo ever taken. Which this photo proved to everyone that. This face is a natural landform, and not an alien monument.

But apperently after taking all this time, not everyone was satsified. The people still belive that, it is alien monument. SInce mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it wa sin winter in april 98. it was a cloudy time on mars. So we ended up doing more recearch on this face. It was April 8, 2001. We made contact with a spceshuttle in space. We aske them to take a picture of the face. Their resposnse was that they do not past the face very offten.

They ended up taking a picture of the face. They had some diffecalties getting the picure. But they took the picture. On that day it was a clear day. So no one can say that it can still be alien life. What the picture actully shows is that the martian equivalent of a buttle or a mesa. You can refur to those as like landforms in the mid west. People say it remids them of the Snake River Plain of Idaho.                                ",3,1,0.9244860410690308
ab3211b,"Although many people think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, I believe that it's just a landform. Before spotting this landform, NASA had no further information on alien's on Mars. Also, the camera that the team used was at its' maximum resolution, meaning that they wouldn't miss a thing. Lastly, the team could enlarge the picture three times bigger, so they could see things located on the ground.

Before the team at NASA spotted the ""Face on Mars"" they hadn't heard anything about there being a possibility of aliens on Mars. Therefore, I think It's highly doubtful that this could happen.

Although the first look that the team took was a little hazy, they went back with a higher quality camera, which they set at the maximum resolution. With this camera it would be very unlikely for them to missunderstand an alien creation as a landform.

Lastly, on top of having a high quality camera, the team could enlarge the picture up to three times bigger. This helped them so much that it allowed them to see things as close as the ground. After this, it was positive they couldn't miss a thing.

Considering that before the NASA team spotted the ""Face on Mars"" there was no further evidence of aliens living on Mars. Plus, with the extremly high quality camera that the team used, and the enlarging of the picture I believe that this is an extrodinary landform, alothough some prefer to assume differently.",3,1,0.7957563996315002

ab6c995,"The Face on Mars is not what everyone thinks it is. Hollywood shows, magazines, and radio talk shows can exaggerate to make the landform sound like more than what it truly is. As a NASA scientist, I believe that you should know exactly what this historic landmark is, so you know the correct story for years to come.

First, you never know what publicity will do with the next big story. Media usually talks up the whole situation, to display the story bigger than it is. In this case, many people are under the impression that the landform is a face created by aliens, because of the media. Once a story is out in the public eye, people have different view points as well. ""Some people think the Face is bond fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about. However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.

To back up what NASA has already said, you could easily have a prediction of what may have caused this mound to form. ""....landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" Garvin clearly gives us a connection that we can relate to. We don't all have the privilege to go into space, however we can understand what a landform like the Face may look like, if it is similar to a landform on Earth. Mountains, canyons, hills, or valleys are all form by different forces. The Face may have been formed by the winds on Mars, eroding away the rocks around it until there was a small hill left. Water could have possibly carved around the mound, leaving this landform. There are various, reasonable explanations for how this landform could have been formed.

In conclusion, the Face may be seen as multiple things to the public eye, but the experts at NASA know this landform is nothing more than a coincidence. This landform could have been formed by various causes, but it is merely a lucky chance that this mound would have the features resembling a human face. Although much talk may lead you to believe the Face is an alien creation, trust the expert scientists. The Face is nothing more than a normal landform on the face of Mars.",4,1,0.8871384859085083
ab7926e,"Have you ever heard of the face on Mars? Well if you have do you think its was made by alien life or it is just a natural landform. I think it is a natural landform because there has been no signs of life on Mars. Also we have spacecrafts taking pictures on Mars so if there we would know about it. This is why I think it is a natural landform.

So if you think that this "" Face"" was created by alien life then you are wrong because I can tell you that there are no life on Mars what so ever. We know this because we have spacecrafts flying around Mars taking pictures every second of everyday of every year. This is why it is just a natural landform.

It looks like a normal rock on Earth just with a face that was created by the way it was formed. This is one reason that it is a natural landform.

Another reason that is a natural landform is because my good buddy Garvin says that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a lava dome that takes the shape of an isolated mesa around the same height as the face on Mars. Im am telling this because land masses can form anywhere and look like anything. That is another reason it is a landform.

My last reason it is just a landform that you can find anywhere is that the first photo was taken in 1976, back then we didnt have the technology we have now. In 1976 we had a camera that had the range of 43 meters per pixel, which is not good. Now in 2001 we had a camera that had 1.56 meters per pixel which is the best at the moment. The picture in 1976 does look like a face but in the picture in 2001 it looks like a normal rock with a lot of cracks in it. That is my last reason of how it is a natural landform.

Those were my reasons to try and convince you that the rock on Mars is just a natural landform. My reasons were that there has been no signs of life on Mars. My second reason was that it looks like every other rock i have seen on this Earth. And my last reason is that we have a lot better technology then we did back in 1976. You can believe what you want to believe but it is just a normal rock like anything else.                 ",4,1,0.8441537022590637
ab7f92e,"The discovery of the Face on the surface of Mars was thrilling for the public. As a scientest working for NASA, I am constantly debating with others whether or not the Martian mesa commonly referred to as the Face was created by aliens. Many people think that it was created by aliens. However, I disagree with the fact that the Face might have been created by aliens. It is simply another Martian mesa located in the region known as Cydonia.

One of the main reasons the Face was not created by aliens is because there are multiple Martian mesas throughout Cydonia. Martian mesas are commonly found throughout Cydonia, and it would be logical to think that the Face is just another Martian mesa. The only difference between the Face and other Martian mesas is that the Face contains unusual shadows making it look like an actual human face.

Not only are Martian mesas commonly found in Cydonia, pictures taken by spacecrafts have proven that the Martian mesa does not look like a face. Although many people have said that the photo taken by the Viking 1 in 1976 resembles a face, unusual shadows made the Martian mesa take the appearance of a human face. Also, the photo taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 does not have very good resolution. In order to see the Face, the photo taken in 1998 by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had to be taken through wispy clouds which has led some skeptics to believe that the alien marking were hidden by haze. However, the photos taken in 2001 by the Mars Global Surveyor are much clearer and have much better resolution. These photos reveal the truth about the Face; it is just another Martian Mesa.

In addition to the fact that the photos reveal the truth, it would be illogical for NASA to keep life on Mars a secret. If NASA was to announce to the public that life on Mars has been found, it would significantly help NASA. More people would support NASA and hope more would be discovered about the life found on Mars and would encourage the government to provide NASA with large amounts of money to learn even more about life on Mars.

Although it would have been cool to know that the Face was created by aliens, there is too much proof to support the fact that it is just another Martian mesa. With such advanced technology in use today, NASA will hopefully make huge discoveries in the near future.",4,1,0.8547410368919373
ab81c08,"The face on Mars is 100% just a natural formation of rocks and sand/dust. Pictures show this, everytime NASA does take a picture of it there are the same results. Plus if it was alien why would NASA publish the pictures. If this was proof of aliens it would put people into freak out mode.

The first thing is that giant rock formations aren't uncommon in the cydonia section of Mars. In fact there are a whole bunch of different kinds of rocks just like the face, only that those are normal looking. They don't look like faces. The article even says that the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Even Garvin says ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,'' then he keeps going to say ''That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.''

The second thing is close up images. Over the years NASA has been taking pictures of this formation. Each time they take a picture of face, the face starts to look more and more like a rock formation. NASA even publicly posted pictures on the web, and all diferent kinds of media to show what the formation looks like. So, NASA must of been pretty confident in what they were saying the picture was. Plus NASA is made of the top of the line professionlas. They aren't made up of people who dropped out of highschool. They are made up of people who have graduated from some of the most advanced and instutionalized colleges.

My third thing is if it was alien, why would NASA publicly show the pictures. In the article, it makes NASA look like they were trying to get people to get away from the alien idea. By the sound of it, I would take a guess and say if it was alien, NASA would do everything in their power to keep the images from getting out into the public. Another thing is that at one point people were saying that the picture taken on April 5, 1998, was not liable because of the fact that 98 was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. So, NASA on April 8, 2001, took another photo in the year 2001 and 2001 was not a cloudy year for the Red Planet .The photo even further backed up the fact that the formation on Mars is just another giant rock, not some alien face or artifact.

So in the end why would this be an alien face or aritfact. NASA has publicly proven that it is just a formation of rocks and dust/sand. Plus if NASA didn't wan't us to know about aliens or anything of the sort, why would they publicly anounce and show pictures of the Face of Mars.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a pictue ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for that image. When the image appeared on a JPL web site revealing just a natural landform peopole finally knew that there was no alien monument after all.

Another reason why i think The ''Face on Mars'' is just a natural lanform because, ''The Face on Mars'' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!

Some people think the Face is evidence of life on mars.

April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum resolution.

As a rule of thumb, you can turn things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small item, you would be able to see what they were!

In this argumentative essay i have tried to convince people that the Face is just a natural landform.  ",3,1,0.9377855062484741
aba1c2e,"Landform or alien? The face on Mars looks pretty cool right. This face of Mars made it to hollywood and radio talks and books. People were egar to see this face, once they saw it then there was alien talk. We all know its cool to think there might be life out there, but it's just a natural landform.

Even though this face is so detailed with the mouth and the eyes and nose, it's just a natural landform. NASA even said it for themselves. "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was NO alien monument after all."" So, If a professional NASA team says it's a landform, i'm not going to argue on the debate.

However if your still not conviced I have more to prove. I haven't heard any information about aliens being true or alive. So, why would we still believe and hold on to the fact that there may not be life out there. NASA hasn't said anything about aliens but they have said that things happen. Such as the face on mars.

Although there are many, many facts about the face on Mars, I would get if you came up to me and said ""Aliens did this to Mras because its so detail and how could that be if no one has been to Mars, so there are aliens."" Only because we don't actually know if there are aliens ,but in the end its just lava that created this dome like face. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

abe7f2a,"Is the ""Face on Mars"" real or not real? Some may argue against this, but I feel that there isn't enough proof to conclude that the ""Face on Mars"" is real. There are many reasons behind this statement. The original picture was taken during the cloudy Martian winter and the photography business has improved so much since then that the new image are proof that there is no face. I feel that the ""Face on Mars"" in not actually an alien-made structure because The original picture, which is what started the theory of Mars having a ""face"", was taken during the very cloudy Martian winter, the photographs taken of the ""face"" have changed a lot over time, and the newest 2001 image has basically proven the ""Face on Mars"" not to be real.

First off, the original picture of the ""Face on Mars"" was taken during the Martian winter which was very cloudy at the time. The photograph had obviously had to have been different than the actual so-called ""face"" because of this. If you were to try taking a picture when it is very foggy outside, would you be able to get a clear picture? No, you would barely be able to tell what the photograph was supposed to be of. Imagine taking that same photo from several hundred yards away. The picture would be even worse than before.

Secondly, the photograpy business has changed a lot from 1976 to 2001. One of the most well known atributes of a camera is its pixel size. The more pixels you have in a certain area, the better the photograph. The original image from 1976 had pixels that were 43 meters per pixel for the photo. 25 years later, during 2001, the new photograph taken of the ""Face on Mars"" had pixels that were nearly 30 times smaller than the original. This image's pixels were 1.56 meters per pixel.

Finally the most recent photo of the ""Face on Mars"" has basically proven the theory of the ""Face on Mars"" to be unreasonable. Afterall, the new image shows that valleys and craters in this structure. You can now tell that what was thought to be the eyes, nose, and mouth of the ""Face on Mars"" are just mere indentions on the structure. The ""Face"" really looks nothing like an actual human face. There just simply isn't enough proof in the new photograph to logically think that the ""Face"" is alien made.

As I said at the beginning of this explanation, there is still a lot that can be argued about. The fact that this structure os probably at least several thousand years old plays a huge factor in the theory. Mars's winds and stroms could have possibly worn away the details on the ""face"". Also, the valleys and craters could have come because of an earthquake or some other natural event. This is an argument that may last forever.

All in all, there is simply not enough proof to make the conclusion that the ""Face on Mars"" is alien-made. The time period has changed. The photography has changed. In fact, NASA wishes that there was enough proof to call this alien-made, but they think that there just isn't enough yet.

Scientific observations at NASA leads us to belive that the theory of an alien face on mars is fake. The idea that the object is anything more than a natural mesa on the planet is not backed up by proven facts.

Theories of the mesa on mars actually being some sort of alien face or object have no proof. NASA has refrenses from our own planet to compare the object to, and high-resolution camers to photograph the object. While skeptics on the other hand, have nothing more than thier own personal beliefs. Unfortuianly the rest of NASA and other people in general belive otherwise.

After researching the landform it saows resemblence of a mesa. The ""face"" actually had the researchers think of formations in the American West that would become a type of dome shape that would form from lava. That theory has a decent amount of real life facts compared to the alien theory. So far that is the best theory NASA has on what the object is.

In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" whilst reading throught the fifth paragraph, they quote that defenders of NASA's budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars. This made me wonder why they would think that. It's because it would be more than just a landform like a mesa. They would have more to look into than just a face looking terrain. But being scientists they realized it was not as much as they'd hoped for. Therefore having no reason to lie about the mesa.

However putting myself in the shoes of a person who wouldn't know about all these facts or opinions, I could see why these beliefs are taken seriously. But that's why we have researchers like NASA. To look into theories with more knowledge behind them and see how they turn out afterwords.

After all the pictures, refrenses, and comparisons, the face of Mars should be known as a mesa, and not an alien artifact. However there are always more people that will belive it is alien. But that's just a theory.",4,1,0.8705785870552063
ac6a5bf,"Is the landform on Mars created by aliens or just a natural landform. In the article '' Unmasking the Face on Mars'', it talks about this landform on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists say that the landform was created by aliens. NASA says that they wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. In my opinion, the face on Mars is just a natural landform because it is not seen as much often, it is proven not to be created by aliens, and the landforms are common around Mars.

First, the landform can not be seen as often. In paragraph 9, it says that mission control scanned the planet and they rarely pass over it. Mission control also took pictures of it. They took pictures to have a better look at the landform. In April 8, 2001 Mission control used Mars Global Surveyor to take more photos on maximum resolution because it can hardly by seen. So that is why the landform can be seen less than usual.

Secondly, the landform is proven not to be created by aliens. In paragraph 6 and 7, it says that on the scientists' research they found that the landform is not created by aliens. It is not created by aliens because the landforms are common in that area. Also that when they tried to find the answer, they used photos they took with maxium resolution on it. So that is how the landform is proven not to be created by aliens.

Thirdly, the landforms are common on Mars. In paragraph 12, It says that the picture of the landform is common. It also said that the landform is like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. In the text is says,''that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is the same height as the face on Mars. So that is why the landforms on Mars are common, not created by aliens.

In conclusion, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. There are many reasons or details that says that it is a landform. Some reasons or details are that the landform is common on Mars and that it proven not to be created by aliens. The reasons for this is the formation of rocks.

ac6cc38,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, it is only a natural landform on Mars. It is a natural landform on Mars similar to a mesa or butte. The landform only resembles a face and was not made by aliens. Scientists have examined pictures of it and concluded it has no alien decent. The Face is a landform and was not made by aliens.

The first reason the Face is a landform is that the Face is similar to an Earthern landform like a mesa or butte. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. NASA beleives this is a rock formation and not anything else. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The Mars Face is similar to Earthern landforms, thats why it can't be an alien produced object.

In 1976 the camera photos weren't as good as they are now. The photo in 1976 isn't as reliable as the 2001 photo taken. In paragraph 7 it said, ""revealing a... natural landform."" There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that this newer photo from 1998 shows more evidence than the 1976 photo. More data can be gathered from newer photos to show that the Face is a landform.

If the Face was an alien monument, then NASA would tell people of the information to get an exploration going. They would have sent out another mission to investigate the Face. It said, ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" This shows that NASA was as anxious as the people to try and discover new foreign life. This is why NASA would have investigated if the Face on Mars was an alien monument But it is a landform.

Some people might say that NASA is still lying about the Martian Face being alien related. Conspiracy theorists would say things like the Face is pure evidence of alien life. In paragraph 5 it said, ""the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" The conspiracy theorists who say this are wrong because NASA has proven that it is a landform. This is why those conspiracy theorists are wrong.

The Face on Mars is a landform. It is not alien related in any way. The scientists at NASA have proven it. NASA would not lie, they need money to fund anything so they would have to tell people. This is why The Mars Face is not alien related and is a landform.",4,1,0.8686037063598633
ac84bac,"The face on mars is really just a butte; that is just a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. NASA has even proved that with the first pucture. But people still didnt beleave them.

Science can prove this by taking pictures every few years to see the diffrance. In the oragnle photo in 1976 it does look like a face but, that was from 1976. Then in 1998 they took a other photo and it dosnt look like a face at all but, people still didnt beleave them so in 2001 they took one more picture, and it revealed it is just a mesa in the martian area of Cydonia. In Cydonia there are many mesas and buttes.

So that proves that the martian face is really a mesa. But you will still come up with awsers for the missing fetures like a ¨cloud¨ in the way, so the camraes couldnt get a good image. So like I said before NASA sent a other probe to get a good image and it was in 2001, and it pleased the publuc.",2,1,0.8658404350280762
aca3239,"We humans have been trying to discover aliens for more than a million years. Why have we not found them yet? We have been up in space multiple times and we have had yet another more multipe times sent space robots that went into orbital. So ask your self this question why have we not found aliens yet?

I think due to evidence that it is a natural landform. I think it is a natural landform because in paragraph one it states that ""...when it spotted the shadowly likeness of a human face."" When I read this I then concluded that it only really looked like a human because of the shadows that make up the ""eyes, nose and mouth"" in which makes this rock figure looking as if it has a face. I do think that is a natural rock landform because God created the earth so that only people would live on earth. Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. Another example of why that the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform is because it states in the text on paragraph seven that ""There was no alien monument after all."" This is poroving that even scienctists have conculuded that there was no landform on mars. Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to ""face landform"". Though due to the pixalation i think that it did not look like a face anymore. The scientists should have put each photo in the same pixilation because it would have been an accurate demonstration over the years and how this rock landform has formed.

Based on the evidence from the article and my past knowleadge I have conculded that this rock landform is in fact a natural landform that aliens have not created/ made this face looking landform. So what do you think?",3,1,0.7827661037445068
acda8eb,"In the year of 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft found a face looking figure staring back at the cameras. A lot of people have conspiracy theories that the aliens caused this. Though, anyone with a decent amount of knowledge in astronomy and even geology, will know that this is simply a mesa of some sort.

With a lot of people and few scientists still believing that the Face was some type of alien creration or artifact, it became a priority for NASA when the MSG arrived to Mars. The MGS was ready to fly over Cydonia to have a better look and get a better picture of the Face. As they were flying over the Face, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the previous pictures taken by the Viking 1 spacecraft. The pictures were released and all the people eager to see the pictures and everyone from NASA saw that it was nothing but a natural landform.

Though, people and few scientists weren't ready to give up on their opinion. When they looked at the pictures they claimed that the time the picture was taken was a cloudy time. They believed that the clouds affected the quality of the picture. They also said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the haze.

So NASA reacted to these skeptical claims. On April 8, 2001, On a clear day with no clouds, the MGS was ready for a second investigation of the Face. The MGS rolled 25 degrees to the center of the Face. The picture was amazing using the camera's maximum resolution. The pixels from the image from 2001 spans 1.56, while the viking's best photo had 43 meters per pixel. The picture was so amazing that if there was some objects like landed plains or small shacks you could see what they were.

The Face was an amazing discovery, though some people got carried away thinking it was created by aliens. Though those conspiracy theories were invalid, it doesn't take away the merit from NASA findind this amazing landform on mars and taking high quality pictures. You never know, people might even be able to experience the Face from an even closer look!                              ",4,1,0.7847799062728882

The face on Mars is a landform because there was no alien monument. And also scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact. I know this because in the article it states, ""The caption noted a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This shows that there is no alien activity on Mars and that there's just shadows that forms the human shaped head.

Twenty five years ago NASA found a human shaped head on the planet of Mars. People believed that alien activity caused the head but what really was was shadows that formed the head. Then in 1998, and 2001 NASA and scientists upgraded to a new high resolution image to figure out it wasn't formed by aliens.",2,1,0.8826698064804077
acfb858,"People actually thought that the face on the planet was a sign that there was still life on that planet or an alien monument , and that the NASA was trying to hide the photos alot of people couldn't wait to see the photo of the face .

In NASA we thought that it was created by an alien , because thats what people thought , they thought it was bona fide evidence of life on mars because why would an face just appear out of nowhere it had to be an reason for it . so people thought that it was somebody on that planet or an alien . But people never really thought that it can just be and nartual landform we know that sounds weird because , out of all things why would an face just appear so that had people thinking of weird or different ways it formed or got there .

In all reality that it was just an natural landform some people didn't thought we were lying and just trying to hide how it really got there . Defenders of the NASA budget wished that there was an ancient civililzation on mars so we could really know how it got there . But nobody knew so we had to do more resreach , just to find ou that the face was not an alien or a signal to something like life still on the planet it was just a natrually landform but not everyone was satisfied becasue that was a weird landform . they said that the alien markings were hidden by haze .

When they took a picture with the special camera that shows every little detail .

The picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa , they said thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars .

The NASA and all the other groups thought that it was an alien mounument or a sign of life on that planet they never really thought of a natrually land form because it was weird that a face had came out of nowhere on a planet , they had took alot of pictures people thought that nasa was hiding the pictures . they did alot of research just to find out that the face was a natrually land form we already knew , they didnt cause they thought it was weird that a face just pops out of nowhere so everybody thought it was something different but in reality it was just a natrually landform that everybody thought it was something different .

acfd6bb,"I really have to explain this again? This is probably the fifth time. Whatever, here goes. First of all, the fact that this 'face' looks like a face is just a coincidence. If there truly is or was life of Mars, why would this massive rock be a sign of it? The earlies picture of the face is an extremely low quality and blurry image taken by a really old camera. Even in the picture from 1976, to me it just looks like a rock, which it is. Newer photos show the intricate cracks and molding on the landmass, there's even 3D models showing what it really is. There is absolutely no way this is something created by a living being. Just look at the size of it! Well, I guess you can't tell how big it is from the photos, but it's miles long. There is nothing that could exist with enough power to make something this huge, yet leave nothing behind to show us proof of foreign lifeforms. So many consistencies in this evidence has to convince anyone skeptical that the Face is just a rock. Got it? I hope you learned something today.",3,1,0.8584229350090027
ad07e4b,"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It, when originally pictured, may have looked like some sort of face or alien artifact, but with new high-resolution imaging and 3D altimetry, we can see that this ""Face"" is just a mesa. This type of mesa is commonly found in the region of Mars where the Face is located, called Cydonia. These mesas are also commonly found here on Earth, in the American Southwest. The fact that these types of landforms are commonplace means that the Face is nothing special.

One piece of evidence that supports my claim is the new photos. Back in 1976, when the Face was first pictured, the pixel size on photos of Mars was 43 meters per pixel! That makes for a very blurry picture with not many details. When the Face was photographed in 1998, and again in 2001, the pixel size was much smaller, at 1.56 meters per pixel. This means that objects on the Martian surface bigger than 5 meters would be picked up in detail by the photo. This proves that the new picture shows it all: a common, everyday mesa.

A second piece of evidence that supports my claim is that NASA would not try to hide alien artifacts in their pictures from the public. This is because if NASA found life on Mars through one of their studies, they would become very popular for the fact and would draw a lot of attention. They may have even won a Nobel Prize, so NASA would definitely not hide it. Conspiracy theorists who claim the Face is alien would be completely wrong because of this fact. NASA isn't hiding anything. The Face on Mars is just a mesa.

A third piece of evidence that supports my claim is that NASA was excited about displaying this photo and wanted to learn more just like the public. They wouldn't have given all this trouble to the Face just to lie about it to the general citizens. NASA was probably disappointed when they found out that the Face was a mesa, but they had to tell the truth. Mesas are common around Cydonia, and also common on Earth, so there is no reason for NASA to lie.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a completely false object. This ""Face"" is just a common mesa, found all the time where the Face is and on Earth. NASA did not lie about the Face because they had no reason to. The new, high-resolution imaging says it all. The Face on Mars is a mesa. No doubt about it. Case closed.",4,1,0.8843289613723755
ad0c87b,"Who would you believe, a couple of conspiracy theorists without proven research or scientist with proven research? In 1976, Viking 1 was circling mars and took a picture which seemed to look like a human face. Later, research proved that it was just a landform equivalen to a butte or mesa. People still believed it was an alien creation. I believe the landform on Mars was not an alien creation because: if it was an alien creation NASA would benefit from it, Mars Global Surveyor snapped a photo proving a landform, and in 2001 another photo was taken clearly showing a mesa or butte.

First, if the landform was an alien creation NASA would have benefited from it. In paragraph five, the author stated, "" Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" The author is telling us that NASA wouldn't hide that a civilization created the landform because they would get a better financial stand. The author stated in paragraph five as well, "" Some people think the Face is a 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This theory is clearly proven to be wrong.

Secondly, in 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and capture a photo of the Face which was a landform. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped the photo that was ten times sharper than the Viking photos. In paragraph 7, the author stated, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image fist appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This on photo proved that not only was it not an alien monument, but that it was a natural landform.

Finally, in 2001, another photo was taken by Mars Global Surveyor to capture a second look of the Face. In paragraph ten, the author states, "" ' Malvin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The camera in 2001 was clearly better than the camera in 1976 than the one the Viking had. Also, the digital image taken in 2001 was made 3 times bigger than the pixel size, showing that it was a landform that was a butte or mesa.

In conclusion, I believe that the landform on Mars in not an alien creation because: NASA would have benefited if it was an alien creation, the Mars Global Surveyor snapped a photo in 1998 showing it was only a landform, and in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor also snapped a more precise photo clearly showing it was a landform equivalent to a mesa or butte.

ad14bcb,"The face is just a rock formation that looks like a face due to the shadows which gives it eyes, nose and a mouth. the formation is normal and it is located in cydonia and it reminds alot of people of a mesa.

Many conspiracy theorists say that this is something thaat nasa should not have put out for all to see. they say that in the picture that was sent out was too foggy and that it was hiding things in the fog.

When this face first appeared on there monitors, they were surprised, but allitle bit after that they decided that it was just another mesa, which was common in the place that they found it at, which would be in Cydonia. they said that it just had unusual shadows that gave it the looks of a persons face.

They knew that it was just a martian mese, so they decided to let everyone else see this amazng picture, hoping that they could gather the attention of the public. it did do that which was great but then they wanted to know more. so then when NASA launched another mission for mars they decided to take another picture of the face, which this time it was alot clearer for the people to see that it was just another martian mesa.

People still weren't happy with those pictures, the people didn't know how hard it is to get it in the right place for another picture, but NASA was willing to get another picture for the people to finally prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. they took the picture with the camera's maximum resolution, so that the people could see everything in the picture clearly. although some people might not be satisfied, many people are.

Many years ago scientists thought it was a sign of life too, but this was short lived.

The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact.

The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it.

Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform.

This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001.

This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform.

The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face.

Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.

When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.

This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.

The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.

This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.

Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.

Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.

Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.

One reason is that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because the face has been fading. The text states that they have tooken pictures of this Face on Mars and both times they have the face becomes unnoitcable. For Example: When one of the people went out and took a picture, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""

Another reason for the Face on Mars to be just a natural landform is because of no real proof leading to aliens being there. The passage states that no aliens have interloped the area or anything. The text showed that overtime the face has deceased of showing up. The Garvin states that the Face has come down to looking like ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Well one if NASA keeps saying that there is nothing there its just a face then yeah its just a land form shapped like a face. NASA would get a lot of money if they found some life form on a planet so they wouldnt keep it quiet. There are many land forms that look like that. So if the MGS on the planet kept looking it would find more land forms that looked like that. If it was an alien how is it still alive. All living things need water to survive. So wheres the water at? Also the people found beter cameras to use to take the picture. It was much clearer and you could tell it was just a land form. Michael Malin an his team messed up the first time because when they took the picture it was winter and very cloudy on the Red Planet. The camera lense had to look through shallow clouds to see the face. So some people said the alien face was hidden by haze. So Micheal Malin and his team tried again in April 8, 2001 to take another picture. It was perfect because it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The picture was clear perfect nothing could have told you that, that was an alien face. Some even said it looks like something here on earth. Either a pyramid in Egyptian time or maybe even a mountain. You can make up myths and say that its an alien face, but all the facts say that its just a land form. The land form that looks like a face. It is the ""face"" that helped NASA look closer at there pictures and work on there camera work. The ""face"" has helped people learn more about the night sky and the planets and even the world. But the ""face"" is just a land form. ",3,1,0.7905725240707397

After reading this passage did it make you think about if you were a scientist at NASA? Well it made me think if i were a scientist there and someone thought the face was aliens, and i would have to persuade them its not using the passage to the left. So today that is what im going to be writing about. Heres some resons stated in the passage that lets me know its not aliens, Research showed that it was a Martian mesa with unusal shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh, research showed it was only a natural landform, and it also shows that its not easy for scientist to find cydonia and not everyone was satisfied with results.

As stated in paragraph two scientist stated that it was just another Martian

mesa thats common around that part of mars, and it had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh. A few days later after that mars relsed a picture to the public with the caption ""Huge rock formation"" the picture was captioned huge rock formation to show to the public that the ""face"" they seen in mars was just a natural rock formation. the artical also said that it was also formed by showdows giving the rock things that look like eyes, nose ,lips, and mouth.

Further more even after eighteen long years some scientist still thought that the land formation in mars was a alien artifact, so in 1997 they went back and did more research and wanted to get a better picture. so on April 5th 1998 when Michal and his OCD team snapped a picture of ""alien artifact"" ten times sharper than the first picture. thousadnds opf web surfurs were waiting on the oicture to be relased to see if it really was an alien artifact, and when the picture was finally revealed all it showed was a natural land form. it showed a natural land form because the camera was better and they wanted to prove that it was just a land form and not an alien monument after all.

In Addition alot of people were still not satisfied with what scientist found out in 1998. they thought that the face o mars is located at a 41 degrees north martian latitude and it was winter in april 1998 and it wes a cloudy time of a year for the red planet and they had to look though alot of clouds so some of the markings were a haze. And mission control said that its not easy to find that part of mars and that its hard work and that they dont pass over the face very often but in 2001 on a cloudless day in cydonia mission control went i for a second look and they rolled the camera 25 degrees in on the center of the face in the field veiw and the picture was 3 times bigger than before and the picture still showed that it was not a face and that it was a natural land form and it looked like a couple of land forms on earth.

in conclusion all three of the times they went to mars and

took a picture it always showed that it was not a face and that it was a natural landform instend.                     ",4,1,0.8797100186347961
ae317f3,"I strongly believe that we have found something on mars and that it is just a natural landform. Their are many ways people can take this matter but since I am a scientist at NASA I can tell you what really happened. People may or may not believe me but I know what happened and I hope that you can listen to what I have to say. Aliens in my opinion are not real and I strongly think that they only way that a face would be on Mars is by a rock formation that happened.

When we looked at the pictures that they found of the rock formation there we saw a head,nose,and a mouth but ther were also formed by shadows. Then came Mars Blobal Surveyor and helped out and got more pictures from the rock. They got pictures that were ten times sharper then the orginal pictures. After all they concluded that there was no alienen moument at all and that is was made out of rock.

The people thought that it was a alien moument and got frustrated and that we were wrong. Of course there had been things about it on tv shows and radio talked and maybe even in grocery stores. You might think that we wnated to hide from what we saw because it wasn't what we would have hoped for. The truth is that we didn't want to make up something that wasn't real because then everybody would believe that and then it would be also bad for NASA. NASA goes into outer space and we find stuff that we haven't known about and that interests us and makes us what to go out there more.

When people then make up things about hiding it they only think about what people around them that are saying. They don't go up to space and they don't see what we see in space. Even if there were life we would share that but lieing to people about life in Mars is not right. It's not fair for people to think that their is life just because we saw a face. We even had help from other people to help us. They helped us with the pictures and with those pictures we could also tell there wasn't life.

I concluede that what we have found is real and that there was only a rock foundation. We don't want people believeing that wrong thing and for NASA then that also would be bad because then we couldn't discover all new things that we found to everyone. I hope that I have convinced you why there wasn't an alien monument but just a rock formation from Mars.                         ",3,1,0.8643885850906372
ae807e5,"Have you ever just wondered if there could be life somewhere else from earth?

If so then how about the face that they found on mars. Many people dont agree that it's just landform that built it's self up and just happened to resembul a face. Others would disagree and say that it is just land and that shodows were the main purpose of the enitre thing that made it look like a face. Why did the face on mars not look the same in 1976 i looked like a smilly face at first.

When the picuture was taken it was taken in many different angles. That shows that there is a posability that the picture that they took at the time was in a way that made it have shadows an some sides. The camara that took it could have been faceing in the direction that the sun was shining and got some of the light make shadows on the landform.

The scientist that looked at the picture taken by Viking 1 says it was only landform shaped in different ways. Makeing it appear like something that is not really there. Garvin says that it remindes him of a lava dome around the America West it's about the same height as the face that they found on mars.

When they first took a picture of the face in 1976 it looked nothing like a face it only looked like a smily face and even that was hard to tell. After a couple of years in 1998 in looked like an oval shaped box and it was sunken in. And in 2001 is when started to shape into something over the years in changed and over more years it will change even more. After that and so on because that's just what landforms do they change but, you can't always see the same thing you sole once.

I can see why some people don't see why it could be a landform And that its actually something else it does look like a face .it could actually be a statue and not just land shaped in to something but the thing is of it was really a statue or remaines of something or someone But,then why wouldn't it looks fuler or have actuale face there would be bones. And if there was a statues then why is it only it's head you would a lest find the other parts of the statue but we haven't and that's because it only a land form shaped into something almost everyone beleives to be actuale life.

In conclution that object that was found on mars is only land built up that looks some what like a face and not a statue or remains of a living person or creature. but something that was a different landform a long time ago before it became what is know as the face on mars.",3,1,0.867332935333252
aec7837,"All scientists at NASA know that the ""The Face"" is a natural landform known as a mesa. But some people think that Nasa is lying to the public about it being a natural landform. I'm here today to argue that Nasa is indeed not lying.

My first reason for knowing that NASA is not lying is that a drone was up in space taking pictures of it close enough to show the world tha it was just a natural landform. Viking 1 is the name of the spacecraft that took this photo and some mission controllers were suprised to see a face popu up on their screen. The chief scientist for NASA'S Mars exploration program said ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it .""

They also got more icture to deduce that it was actually instead of a face it was a natural landform. Thats my first reason for knowing that NASA is not lying.

My second reason for knowing NASA is not lying is because the landform is called a mesa. Mesa's are more commonly found in the American West. So by thinking hardly about this it comes to mind could people that dont believe, could possibly being saying that this mesa isnt a mesa but something NASA is trying to cover up? But then the question comes to be WHY would Nasa be trying to hide some of this information from the public? Well it comes down to the simple fact they arent trying to hide anything from the public about the face they are giving us the true information and some people just dont thig thats the real actual truth.

My thrid reason for knowing that Nasa is not lying they made the pictures into digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size so if anything was on the surface such as a shack you could tell what it was. They do that so if they see anything that is a undertiminable object you can clerly tell what it is. The pixels arent as good as they could be today but they had a pretty lea view of what it is. they have the best cutting edge technology and are way more advanced than the open world is today so its highly unlikely that their system wasnt processing right. thats the end of my thrid reason.

So some people believe that the face is actually just a natural landform but some people such as conspiracy theorists dont. I say that the conspiracy theorists have a point on why Nasa could be lying to the public. They probably think this because of the goverment owning and controls Nasa that Nasa is lying to us like the goverment could be because of their secret projects. The reason the goverment doesnt tell s about some of their plans is because its to keep the United States of America safe from the har of foreign countries. Those were the reasons conspiracy theorists think like they do.

All that information can signify that Nasa is not lying to us. Though some people may think they are because they are apart of the goverment .But i think that Nasa is doing a great job and woudnt lie to the press. If they lied to the press they would be utting the U.S goverment a bad public view.",4,1,0.795952558517456

The face of mars is defentilly just a rock formation in 1976 when the rock formation was found they thought it was a coquencidence and they were right. In 1998 they took another photo of the ""Face of Mars"" they had a beter camera with more pixels in it. This photo still does look like a face but you can also kinda see it starting took look like a mountain. Then the last photo that was taken of the ""Face of Mars"" was in 2001 and you can obviosly see that the so called face is just rock formation.

"" I have done research on this for years and only seen photos of the moving figures of a Martian moving on Cydonia."" "" We have seen photos or illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth in the resonable photos I have seen."" "" This photo shows how the ancient civilization of these forming aliens are real."" These forms are basic facts and sought to be true.

Those photos show and just make the picutre seem like it is forming real life aliens, but that is just how the photo was shot. Continuosly, NASA has changed the way they shot the photos. The photo that was taking before was not taking carefully. The others that was taking was by a more advanced shot. Then it was stated to be no alien monument at all. It was just a natural platform of the planet.

This was just a basic statement to show how the alien photos shot by Viking was just not like it was in 2001. Were the phots true? Did the Face On Mars really affect the live of what lives outside of us? Well we know that it really was a natural platform.         ",4,1,0.8999450206756592

NASA belives it was just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" NASA finaly unveiled the image for everyone to see a dew days later, thinking it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It certainly did.

Although few scienctist believed the face was an alien artifact, photagraphing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Blobal Suveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Spet. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking mission ended. ""We felt this was important to taxpayers,"" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""We photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.""

On April 5, 1998 Mars Gobal Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera tea, snapped a picture ten ties sharoer than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxiuos web surfers were waiting when a the image first apeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year in the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia."" says Garvin. ""In fact it's hard work."" On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia MGS drew close enough for a second look. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptain-style pyramids or even smaller shacks, you could see what they were!"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

From the informtion given here it's proven that the ""Face on Mars"" was not created or signs of an alien or aliens on Mars. The ""face"" was just a natural landform just like here in Earth.",2,1,0.8081240653991699
b18df38,"The Face of Mars is a myth that has been discussed for many years. It was first spotted when Viking 1, a space shuttle, flew over it as it was looking at Mars. Many conspiracy theories believe that this face was created by a lifeform on Mars, also known as aliens. NASA has denied this to be fact and stated that the Face is just a naturally made landform that coincidentally looks like a face.

It was first thought in 1976 that the landform was a face, and this was because the camera quality back then was unsatisfactory, and the picture that was taken was so pixelated that it looked like a face was built there on purpose. In recent years after going back and taking more pictures, scientists have realized that it is not at all a face, just a natural landform that looks like one.

If you believe that NASA is lying about it being a natural landform, I will pose this question to you, why? Why would you think NASA would lie about there being life on Mars? NASA would only benefit from life being on Mars, infact they were most likely hoping that there was life forms on Mars when they saw the Face for the first time. There is no reason for them to deny it if it was true. Garvin, NASA's chief scientist for the Mars exploration program, said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Garvin is saying that it resembles natural landforms on Earth, which once again proves the fact that it was naturally created and not man, or alien made.

In conclusion, there is in fact no life on Mars, and it is ludicris to think otherwise. NASA has proven it to be true that the Face is just a natural landform, and nothing more. I have given many facts above that prove my statement to be correct. I hope that after reading this, if you believed there was life on Mars and that was the reason for the Face, you have been enlightened and now realize that you were indeed incorrect.

b1a6f2b,"The Face on Mars

The face on Mars is a mysterious object Mainly because how it resembles a human face from the first picture in 1976 but that picture is outdated. One of the most recent picture taken in 2001 shows that the ""face"" is actually just a landform that appears on Earth and it is common in the American West. This landform is that appears commonly on Earth is known as a mesa. If the face on Mars was proof of an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would have better funding than it allredy has and there would be more exploration on Mars.

Although the Face on Mars has become an icon in pop culture that dosen't change the fact that it is just a mesa and at that time the camera wasn't nearly as advanced as what we have now.

The combination of cameras that werent nearly as good as the cameras that we have now and the shadows that the image had on it made it look very similar to a human face when NASA first took a picture of the mesa. More current pictures show that what looks like a human face in one picture actually is an average land formation on our own planet.

On paragraph 8 in the passage it states ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter '98- a cloudy time of the Red Planet"" is what it says. If that was true, that it was a cloudy winter climate then the aliens wouldn't have enough time to be doing a creation like the face. The aliens would have no clue on how to do a face on Mars. The Face on Mars is just a natrual landform, nothing else. The aliens didn't do a face on Mars. To prove that, evidence from the passage says ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natrual landform."" the web even says that it's just a landform. When the web surfers wanted information about it the web just said that it's a natrual landform. The whole Face on Mars is a landform that scientist found on Mars. The Face on Mars from 1976 till 2001 changed a lot. In 1976 they didn't have much technology to see the face clearly, so they thought it was a face of an alien because the picture was blurry and it looked from a blur that it was an aliens face. Until now in 2001 technology made it clear to see that it's just a landform that is cracked and looks from far away like a face of an alien. Evidence from the passage states that ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoluion."" the team took a photo with an amazing camera to make it clear that it wasn't a face. It made it clear to see that it was just a landform. As you can see that the Face is just a landform and not a face of an alien.

If it was an alien the head would have anteanas on it and the head would be shaped differently than it is.

On April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydionia for the first time,Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) team took a picture.

b235e94,"In this article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" it is about a rock formation from the Red Planet that many people belive was created by aliens but it was not created by aliens. Three reasons are first NASA has little eveidence that it was not created by aliens, second this shadowed human face is just a rock formation, and third the pictures taken revealed it wasnt from aliens.

First, Nasa has little eveidence that it was not created by aliens In the article NASA says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" NASA does have much more evidence too that they wont reveal. In paragraph five it talked about how NASA was hiding there evidence. Also few scientist from NASA believed the Face was an alien artifact for a while too, until they did more investigation and found it wasnt.

Second, this shadowed human face is just a rock formation. In the article it says ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. At first scientist figured it was another Martian mesa, but then they found out it wasn't which I'm sure they're glad it was something else because Martian mesa are something common. In paragraph twelve they give descriptions and compare the rock formation to earth like things. One thing it said was ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Third, the pictures taken revealed it wasnt from aliens. A quote from the article is ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The pictures they had taken were high enough quality to prove it was just that rock formation. A quote from the article to support this is ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" They had a camera that was ten times sharper than the Viking photos that were taken and could see through the clouds and the camera could spot almost anything like weird unusual shapes, markings, and skeptics. In the article it said 'The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

This article is about a rock formation from the Red Planet that many people belive was created by aliens but it was not created by aliens. There were three reasons to support my answer they were first NASA has little eveidence that it was not created by aliens, second this shadowed human face is just a rock formation, and third the pictures taken revealed it wasnt from aliens. After you read this essay you should be convinced it was just a rock formation because there is so much eveidence from NASA proving it is. ",4,1,0.9009867906570435
b23c02c,"The Face on Mars is not made by aliens. There is no proof whatsoever of any signs of life on Mars, which means no aliens. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that coincidently looks like a human face. Given the shadows and shape, the Face very much looks like it has a human nose mouth, and eyes. Although up close, there is no resemblence of a human face. Therefore, do not let this anyone fool you.

Pictures have been taken by NASA of the Face to prove it is just a natural landform. Pictures taken from 1976 appear blurry, and not clear, so it is easy to believe that aliens created the Face. Although, in 1998, the pictures taken aren't as blurry, and you can see the structure of the landfrom clearly. Lastly, the picture taken in 2001 is clear and visible. You can perfectly see that close up, the Face is just another natural landform on Mars. From far away, it looks like a human face because of the shadows, but up close, it is nothing more than a simple landform.

Furthermore, on 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to looks for the Face again. When they snapped a photo of it, it was indeed ""ten times sharper than the photo taken in 1976."" This revealed that it was just a natural landform when the photo appeared online. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

Some people who still believe that the Face was created by aliens say that ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", but the Face was only hidden because it was winter when the photo was taken. Since it was winter in April 1998, it was also the ""cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" Therefore, the camera used had to ""peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" This proves that aliens markings are not hidden by haze; it's the time of year where it is cloudy on Mars, making it harder to see the Face.

Plus, when NASA took another picture in 2001, it was taken using the ""camera's absolute maximum solution."" Based on what I read, ""each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" There simply can't be anything you can miss using the camera's absolute maximum solution. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, even said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could what they where!""

Finally, NASA's explanation about the Face on Mars is based on credible information and research. People who believe aliens created the Face often get the information inside their head, making up crazy theories that aren't actually true. Furthermore, NASA went on missions to prove that the Face isn't made by aliens. They took high-quality photos that show that it is just a natural landscape. Besides making things up on their own, skeptics probably take information from the internet on websites that other skeptics have made about aliens creating the Face. You can never trust the internet, and the skeptics who made these websites probably put down their own made up facts and theories to get people to join their side.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens. It is just extraordinarily shaped to look like a human head, with shadows to create the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth from far away. Up close, there is not resemblence of a human face at all. Pictures, missions, and years of research have proved it.

I disagree,I do not think the face was created by aliens, and there are various reasaons. I do not think the face was created by aliens and I am going to explain why,a face can`t be created by aliens unless it were remains,scientist would have already discovered aliens before the face if it were to be created by aliens, and NASA revealed the face as 2 miles long,it couldn`t be created by aliens.

The face on Mars couldn`t have been created by aliens,how can a face be created by aliens, unless it were alien remains? If it were alien remains,that means aliens would have to exist. Scientist have not found aliens or alien remains to this day. A sharper picture of the face proved it wasn`t created by aliens, mentioned in paragraph 7. Besides, aliens can`t create a face.

If it were to be created by aliens we would have discovered aliens before we found this huge face. Space rovers have been searching the planet mars before the face was found. The face is two miles long according to paragraph one,it would take some time to build it. We would have found aliens building it before we found the face itself. Thus, the face is a natural landform.

The face is two miles long, if it were aliens existing, they would not be able to build something like this. An alien wouldn`t create a two mile landform if it exsited. It would not be a reason to, there would be no benificiary reason for an alien to build a face. It was also discovered as a natural landform. It couldn`t possibly be created by aliens.

In conclusion, I do not think the two mile landform was created by aliens. The only way it would be alien related is if it were alien remains. If it were created by aliens, we would have discovered them already. Since the landform is two miles long,it would take some time if it were to be build. Besides,it`s two miles long, there is no benificiary reason for an alien to spend this much time on a landform, it couldn`t possibly be created by aliens.

b2def99,"The Face on Mars

The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

The formation is just another Martian mesa. Many conspiracy theorists get too overwhelmed when they see this face, because they are so eager for scientsists to find life on another planet. Although it looks as if something made the Face, it was made naturally.

First, the Martian mesa is very common around the area of Cydonia. It was not a big surprise to some scientists to find that it was formed naturally. NASA revealed the image captioning, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The unusual shadows made the landform seem to be a human face.

Next, the Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a photo that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This made the picture even more accurate. When the picture was first unveiled on a JPL web site, people found that the Face was a naturally landform. It was not caused by aliens or other life forms.

Then, Malin's team took a clearer photo than the 1976 Vikining picture. Malin's team's captured a picture on April 8, 2001, in which each pixel spaned 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the Viking photograph. According to the article, you can distinctly view objects three times bigger in a digital image than the pixel size. In paragraph 11, the author says ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The 2001 picture shows that the Martian is equivalent to landforms that are common near the American West.

Ultimately, the research and pictures were clear, the landform was not made by any life forms. The Face was formed naturally. The Martian mesa is very common in the area of Cydonia, where it was found by. Scientists and their teams captured photos that showed that this was landform was caused naturally. With the technology the scientists like Malin used, it is easy to tell that there was no aliens that affected the mesa.",3,1,0.8956480622291565

I know because the picture was taken in poor quality, we now have a higher quality picture proving it is nothing but a natural landform, and if it was created by aliens, we we wouldn't keep it a secret. Thats how i can prove to you that the face was not created by aliens.

The original picture- the one looking like a face- was taken on a poor quility camera. It was taken on the viking 1, according to the article, in 1976. The camera equipment was out of date, making that picture irrelivent. Also, one pixel on the camera spanned 43 meters, according to the reading. Thats one reason that the picture looked like a face.

Another way we are sure that is wasnt alien-made, is ouur newer photo-evidence. As stated in the previous paragraph, the one pixel on the viking 1 spanned 43 meters. Our newest photo was shot with a camera having pixels spanning 1.56 metes. That's a big difference! Our new camera is up to date, and proves that it is nothing but a natural land form. Lastly, according to the reading, we captured a picture of the face at the maximum quality. This proves to show that the old picture was just an illusion, because of the low quality.

The last reason that we can be sure that th face was nothing but a landformation, is the fact that if it was made by aliens- we wouldnt be keeping it a secret. If anything, it would be benificial towards NASA if we found aliens. It would gives us a beter reputation and more money to fund our projects.

These are all reasons that we can use to prove to you that the face was nothing more than a natural landform. The original photo was taken in 1976, with an outdated camera.

b330def,"Many people believe that the 'Face on Mars' was formed by aliens. What do you think? If you were told that the face on Mars was created by aliens, what would you do? What would you say? I know what I would do. I would call them crazy and explain to them that aliens do not exsist and that it was a fact of science.

The 'Face on Mars' is a natural landform. The light from the sun is shone across the landform to make it look like it has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth like a human person, but, if you were to create an exact copy of Mars, put on a different scale, hold it still, and shine light at the exact angle of the sun, you would see that the sun is what really causes the 'Face on Mars' to appear to look the way it does.

Aliens, if they exsisted, could not have created something so magnificent and perfect that at that angle it would look like a face. Scientists have studied the geography of Mars for years and have had nothing to say about aliens. They have prooven their facts and have given us reason to believe that this was simply the way Mars was stuctured and that the rays of the Sun are the cause of it looking like a face.

If aliens did create the 'Face on Mars', why would our scientist have not discovered them? Why havent we ever then seen one before? For those that believe that it was aliens that sculpted Mars, I am sorry, but you are wrong. Mars was naturally formed and can never and will never be changed by aliens because aliens simply do not exsist.

So, for all of those out there in our lovely world that think that aliens do infact exsist and that they somehow, over millions of years created a 'Face on Mars', I would like to say one last thing on my behalf, aliens do not exsist and could not have created something so mindblowing. ",3,1,0.8590932488441467
b362cc5,"Alien Life! A very controversial topic, some might say, especially at this point in time.

Some people believe that the face that has been photographed on Mars is evidence of alien life; however, it is just a landform because if NASA wanted to hide the existence of aliens they wouldn't have released this image in the first place, there were no other ""alien artifacts"" near the face in any of the images, and if the face was in fact an alien artifact, NASA would use this to its advantage because they would receive more funding to find alien life since there would be proof that alien life actually exists. Obviously, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact but only a natural landform made on the surface of the Red Planet.

One of the most blatantly obvious reasons why this face could not be made by aliens is because NASA does not believe that it is. Now, every one is entitled to their own opinions, but because NASA is saying that this face is not an alien artifact you should think that same thing. There would be no reason for NASA to want to release an image that possibly supports that there could be alien life on Mars and then just say that it provides no evidence for life on Mars, if NASA actually believed there really was life on the Red Planet. Either, NASA would have not released the image at all in an effort to prevent people from thinking that aliens could be living on Mars, or they would release their image and say the truth. In this case NASA released the image and then said that it does not support alien life on Mars, so it is very clear that the landform is just a landform and not an alien artifact.

Also, there were no other ""alien artifacts"" near the face. If this really was an alien artifact, there would be evidence left behind of the people that built this face, but there was not. And, the more recent pictures of the face were very high resolution, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters."" That may seem like a very large area for one pixel, but unless these aliens that live on Mars all live in one home that is less than twenty-five square meters, there is no one near this face that could've built it. Clearly, this landform could not have been made by anyone living on Mars because there simply is no one that is living close enough to this face to build it.

And last but not least, if this face on Mars was indeed an alien artifact, NASA would use this scenario to its advantage by blowing up the media with news of alien life in an attempt to gain more funding for the space program. There is absolutely no reason for NASA to try to keep the discovery of alien life a secret because, if anything, NASA would gain substantially from a discovery on that scale, so if the scientists at NASA think that this face is just a landform made on the surface of Mars, there is very little reason for someone to doubt them on this.

Now, some people may say, ""But wait! That face is clear evidence of alien life, and there is no way that a face like that could have naturally formed on Mars!"" If anyone is thinking that same thing, I can see why you may think that, but there is simply no scientific evidence to support your opinion. Yes, it is unlikely for a rock to form in the exact way to make it look like a human, but no, it is not impossible. Additionally, if that face was in fact a natural formation then there is no more evidence for it to support alien life than any other rock on Mars. Obviously, this landform was not made by aliens.

As anyone can see, the face on Mars is just a natural landform because NASA wouldn't release images propagating alien life if they didn't want to say that alien life has been discovered, there is no other evidence supporting aliens on Mars other than the face, and there would be no reason for NASA to try to cover this up because NASA would end up gaining in a situation where alien life was discovered.

Obviously this face is not an alien artifact; however, I believe that alien life does, in fact, exist, and that we may find it in the very near future, so look forward to what may come next.",6,1,0.8490951061248779
b388756,"The Face on Mars is just another landform that was formed naturally. Many landforms that occur on planets are formed naturally. The first pictures that were taken of the natural landform were very blurry due to the bad quality of the cameras 30 years ago. But in 2001, the quality of the land form was better and it wasn't a face at all, but rather a natural landform.

First, the ""Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens. The landform is 2 miles in length. To build something as massive as that and it be made from the same material of the planet itself is absurd. It wouldv'e taken a long time and the face would really look like a face. With the highest quality photo that was taken in 2001, it is clearly seen that there is no face and it is just another natural land form with bumps on it.

Second, the ""Face"" is just another naturally forming landform. It is a landform that is called a mesa because it is really steep. There are many mesas on Earth and are naturally forming. Because of their massive size, they can't be formed any other way. There are also many strange formations on Earth but they couldn't have been created by aliens either because natural landforms are, for the most part, massive and can't be changed.

Third, movies, books, magazines, and newspapers that claim that the ""Face"" was created by aliens are either fictional or don't have any proof. Movies that are made about this landform and how it was made by aliens is fake becuase there is no scientific proof that it was made by aliens. The movies are usually fiction and are trying to make money off of a hot topic that most of the audience is interested in. Books, magazines, and newspapers try to make the impossible sound real without any proof of there actually being aliens. Making the possible sound real is just another marketing strategy for companies to sell their products to people that believe in whatever they are told.

In conclusion, aliens did not make the mesa on Mars. Aliens are just used as an excuse for publishers and directors to get money off of people that believe in aliens. Mesas are huge landmarks that are formed naturally, which is just what the supposed ""Face"" is. If there were aliens that really wanted to create a face, they would created the face in musch more detail than just bumps along a mesa. Also, an aliens face would be very unlikely to look just like a human face. In the end, people that say that the mesa is actually a face have no scientific and factual proof to back it up.

The photos in the article make the Face look like a alien creation and it does looks like a face on some levels. Although it is a mysterious creation, alot of natural landforms can make these things. Landforms are very creative things. In the article it shows photos from 1976, 1998, and 2001. Now cameras are the best they can be, but back in the 1970's and 90's they werent the best. Especially 1976 camera. So who can really tell for sure what it is? They did say they were making pictures sharp and more pixels with 3D resolution. In 1998's photo it looks like a hole is in the Face. Then in 2001's photo it looks breakable. If aliens did make it they would have done something better for it to be unbreakable so it would be there for a long time. Natural landforms could break, even rocks can break! People were scared about the Face because they thought it could do something, its simply stuck there on mars.

For my conclusion i would say that the Face is just a natural landform creation, we dont know if aliens do exist or not. There will always be people who believe its an alien creation and there is also people who will believe its a natural landform on Mars. I dont think we will find out what it is for sure until we figure out if aliens do exist. It'll be way in the future or maybe sometime now. When we do, then we can change our beliefs.

My coworkers and I think that the Face is a remnant of an alien civilization. We would like to hear your opinion on the subject.""

""Well, for one thing, NASA wouldn't benefit from the keeping the discovery of aliens away from the population.

b465af2,"Was there a man on Mars? Magazines say yes, but the scientists have continuously said no. On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts.

First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the ""facial features"" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth.

Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors.

Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the ""face"". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa.

In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point. Scientists proved their point by explaining unusual shadows, confirming information with additional scientists, and taking countless photographs of the mesa.",4,1,0.8566177487373352

Like it is simply just a mesa, the photo Malin took, and there are many similar landforms around the American West. Certainly it wasn't created by aliens!

It is just a mesa. First, Martian mesas were common. They were very common around Cydonia as said in the article. Second, it did look like a face. That is because of the unusual shadows that formed to look kind of like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Third, it gives an illusion. The illusion is of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. These are the reasons that shows that the Face is a Martian mesa.

Michael Malin's photo shows that it is a landform. First, Malin's photo was taken ten times sharper. It lets it have a more clear image. Second, people think that the alien markings were hidden by haze. Though on the second picture it still doesn't show any sign of alien markings. Third, on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. That day it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's tame captured a fantastic photo. It still didn't show that the Face was created by aliens. The photos that Malin and his team took were very useful.

It is similar to the world in a way. Using photos of the Face they would be able to see if there was any sign of life. Like small homes, or shacks.

With one photo taken of a mysterious figure, people think they have come closer than ever to knowing if there was life long before us on another planet. ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is a topic commonly talked about. Some say the Face was created by aliens, while others say it is the natural landform that caused it. Pictures were taken, and a conclusion have been made whether or not aliens created it, or if it was caused by a natural landform.

In 1976, Viking 1 was orbiting Mars to find a landing space for their sister ship, Viking 2.

While scouting out Mars, Viking 1 comes across an image that could likely show life on Mars. The pictured appeared to be a face, but was debated for a long time. A couple years later in 1998, the Mars Global surveyor (MGS) took a shot of the ""Face"" which revealied a naural landform.

The image shot in 1998 was ten times shaper and more clear than the one taken in 1976. Once the second picture was taken, it was released to the JPL web site showing all, that it was caused by natural landforms and that aliens were not the case. People began to say that the aliens were hidden by a haze since the camera it was taken with had to zoom through the clouds in order to take the shot. The people needed specific evidence to believe that aliens do not exist, so the MGS did just that.

To prove to all the people, a third picture was taken in 2001 by the MGS. The image was shot with the most powerful resolution.

Twenty five years ago, as NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, it snapped a photo of a startling image resembling a human face. After releasing the image to the public, many people became fascinated in the ""face"". This rolled the ball for many people to believe there was an ancient civilization on Mars. However, modern technology and expertise of numerous scientists have discovered the face is merely a natural landform. The use of more efficient cameras have diminished any hopes of alien life on Mars.

NASA's Mars Exploration Program has already identified the area on which the face is found as Cydonia. When the face was first seen in the Jet Propulsion Lab, scientists figured it was a Martian mesa, which were common enough in Cydonia. Although it was abnormally figured in the shape of a human face, scientists already knew mesa's were prominent in the area of Cydonia. Also, modern technology, such as a Mars Global surveyor camera, has revealed the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform. The camera's absolute maximum resoultion picture ensures that no ""alien markings"" were hidden by haze, as some skeptics argued. In the 2001 image, each pixel spans 1.56 meters, whereas pixels in the 1976 image spanned 43 meters. Therefore, the better camera quality ensures the truth behind the Face on Mars: a natural landform.

Some people argue that, due to the cloudiness on the planet, alien life could have been hidden by haze. However, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor on ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia"" and captured another photo. Garvin explained ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Garvin knew if there were any pyramids or shacks, the camera would have been able to capture it and he would have been able to see it. Thus, there is no chance haze could have hidden the aliens. People also argued that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence NASA would rather hide. This is not the case. Authors thought this would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. Therefore, the belief of life on Mars is simply just for the public. It has been in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. The Face on Mars was used to engage the public, not neccessariy to inform.

Proven from better camera quality and scientific knowledge, people can know believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If any civilization was there, the Mars Global Surveyor would have been able to seen it. Also, mesa's are common in the Cydonia area, where the face was found.

People thought that this kind of evidence should be hidden. A few scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact, but phototgraphing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when MGS arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it.

Eighteen years later they decided to end the mission, they felt that it was important to taxpayers.

An enormouse amount of web surfers waited for the pricture, but when it posted they weren't so satisfied. There wasn't and alien monument after all. NASA just does not pass over the face very often.

b66fbcb,"Imagine if you went to Mars, and you saw a face shaped like a Egyptian Pharaoh? You saw the same shape in Cydonia, and you thought it was the same monument? You thought it was a real human face? What if I came to the end of it, saying it's just a natural landform. NASA reveiled the picture, it sure grabbed the publics attention, What if all that was just a lie to get money off of people that found that picture interesting. They could have edited who knows.

On April 5, 1998, when a team flew over to Cydonia, for the first time a few men named Michael Malin and his team snapped a few pictures. It was sharper than the original Viking photos. When the picture was reveiled, it was just a natural landform. After all that their was not a monument with an alien on it (Unmasking the Face on Mars 1, 2, 3, 7).

The ""face"" you see in the picture is just a plain landform. The group went back again, it was not easy to target Cydonia again. When they finally found it, they took the pictues where you could see closer than you thought to see if there were pyramids, airplanes, or small shacks. They came upon the picture there were butte or mesa, and natutal landforms. That reminded them, that was a dome of lava, that looks like a form of a mesa that's deforming and looks the same height as the Face on Mars. This comes to the end that it's just a natural landform.

b68e064,"Some people say it was created by aliens, some people think it is just a rock. That thing is The Face on Mars. In 1976 a spaceshuttle named the Viking one was taking pictures of the Red planet also known as Mars. To find a possable landing place for its sister Viking two. Vikking one was scanning one day and found something on the surface of Mars that resembled a face of a human. The people who were getting the pictures of Mars that were back on Earth were shocked to see a human face appear on another planet.

In the passage it says "" It looks like something that aliens made"". Like I said some people think its from aliens but, thats not logical. If aliens were real than I would believe it. Than again in the passage it also says that The ""face"" could be a mesa. Whenever they took a picture of it ten times sharper than the one before people still wouldn't believe that it is a rock and not an alien creation. When they say alien creation they think of an alien standing there and cutting into rock to make it look like a human face with a really big head.

In the passage it says that it is just a mesa. Some scientist think the way the shaddows are it makes the mesa look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. The passage says that they don't see it often and that they use cameras that go small strip by small strip all over the planet and take pictures. Since the Face on Mars has been discovered it has been popular it starred in movies, books, magazines, and people talk about it in talk shows on the radio, also people talk about in the line at he grocery story. It was discovered just about fourty years ago.

In my opinion I think it is some rocks that got covered up by dust overtime. If people think that it was created by aliens than that's their opinion. It has been scientifically proven that it was not created by aliens. If it was made by aliens then why would the aliens want us humans to know that there is life on that planet. But some pictures of the Face on Mars actually looks like a face but, that could just be the way the planet is getting light and reflected by the sun. So in my opinion I think it is a rock and all the people who think other wise they don't have proof to show that it is a alien creation.

So in conclusion this face on mars isn't a alien creation it is just rocks. In the passage it says that its a lava dome that takes place of an isolated mesa about the same size of the Face on mars which is two miles. So to all the people that think that it is an alien creation, its not. To be honest I think its just dust build up in some places, so when theres a shadow it shines off of it and makes a face that everyone freeks out about. Its just a big rock that does nothing I don't see why it would be a big deal in the first place. ",3,1,0.8675453662872314
b6aa357,"I think that it was a real face, why you ask? Because that could of been a life form, and that could of been were it fell down. Where else would a face in the moon sand be like that for no reason. Like conol sanders always says its finger lickin good. Thats why theres a face there in the moon. Ancient tribes could of lived there before we even discovered the moon orbiting around the planet earth in the first place. There are many theroys about the moon to be exspected. I think that any reason could be leggitimint when kernal sanders made KFC he didnt suspect a thing he just made a ton of chicken with no reason to stop and think. Thats just like a way of discribing any way is possible when you were not alive long ago. Because you didnt have the technology to even try, to see if there were anyone on the moon in the first place. Think of it as saying mabe the didnt even breath the oxygen they could just breathe in space. It seems imposible i know but mabe to the kind of life on the moon didnt need food water or air.

I think that every type of answer can be juged by the way it sounds but there many ways it could happen. like mabe before it was the moon it was a planet to with life on it just like earth with water, food, and resources to stay alive a a point in time long ago. But when it smashed into earth all of its compounits swichted at impact. Burning every living thing on the moon and making things for the earth. My reason is that god made life but when he did he made life on the moon to but eventually it died out before our time and leaving a souless moon for the earth to smash into it 2.3 billion years ago. Creating earth and life, humanity, and the world. When the found the face in the moon, they were just then finding out that the moon may have contained life long ago. Although it might not of happened how I explained, there might of been another way of life its self on the moon. I think it could of been a rational way, but we will never know untill the end of time. As if there was life created on the earth just the same way a little time ago.

Technology has also improved the findings of scientists about he ""face.""

For the most part, scientists are convinced that the theory of aliens building the ""face"" is just a myth. They figure it is just another Martian mesa. The only unusual thing thing about this ""face"" is that there were shadow that give people the illusion that there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Very few scientists fall for the myth that aliens built the ''face."" Most scientists, including myself, would agree that there is no alien life after all.

The first fact that tells us that it was not aliens is, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" This tells us that aliens didn't make it, and that it just formed from shadows that made it look like a face on mars when it was just an illusion.

b81815a,"When looking at the Face over the years, you can clearly tell that it's a landform. From 1976 to 2001 the Face has lost almost all features to make it look like a face. For example, in 1976 you could clearly see a nose and eyes. By 1998 you could hardly make out the form of the nose and there was a crack where a mouth would have been bplaced. Finally, by 2001 you could hardly see any of its features. In the following paragraphs I will discuss detalis and characteristics into further detail.

When I took a first looked at the Face, in the photo from 1976, I saw a clear face with a nose, eyes, and the feature of a pharoh.

By 1998 I could no longer see the eyes and nose look caved in. I did however see the form of a mouth that I didn't see before. A martian couldn't make a face out of the ground because nobody knows for sure that they're real. No one has ever seen a martian so how do we know that they're even there? Land however could completely make this. If you look at Earth and the mountains that have been formed, not by man but by the land, you know that there's no way martian's could've built this.

Also, nobody has proof that this isn't just shadows reflecting onto the ground. There might not even be a landform there but the shadows are forming an allusion that makes it look like a land mass. In paragraph 9, Garvin says, ""We don't just pass over the Face very often."" When Garvin says this, it makes me believe more that it's just a shadow because they don't see it very often. The sun might have to be placed just right to cast the shadows onto that specific spot. Lastly, how would martians know what an ancient pharoh looked like?

Now I'm going to sides with the martian's. If martians were in fact a real living thing, why couldn't they build something to look like a face? I'm sure that they would have hands, fingers, feet, and toes just like humans. If this Face was martian made, maybe they were trying to send a signal to someone like, ""Hey, we really are here and we need your help!"" They could've known that there were space rovers going around their planet from somewhere else. There's no telling who built the Face.

There's no telling how the Face got there or why. The most realistic and logical explanation is that the land formed it. There are many conspiraces out there as to how and why the Face is on Mars. I choose to believe that they had a ""Mars Quake"" and the face just appeared. But in reality nobody knows how it was formed.",3,1,0.792132556438446

According to the text ""There was no alien monument after all."" This was of course after the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydonia and captured a higher resolution image of ""The Face."" In the world of today, you can never prove anything to be real without people spreading rumors.

Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion. But as soon as my co-workers and I heard that people thought the Face was real, we took matters into our own hands and managed to take a couple of other photographs of the landform. Under a closer inspection in 2001 we were able to see that the mysterious Face was a ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" as stated in the text. No ancient alien civilization, just a common landform.

In conclusion, my team here at NASA and I have proven that the pop icon ""Mars martian face"" is actually a natrual landform that can be found just about anywhere.

Scientists all over the world have came up with many ways to prove that there

is no life to proving there is a posibility that a such thing is posible and can accure with proff. The way that scientist can have acurate hypothisises is by flying and scanning the planet with thermale or cooling system that scientist have masterd today. A theory is something that can be true or false by using high studies of reserch but, in most cases there are more likely syfy stories but with real acuranceses in every day life.

There a million hypothesis of what it could be, but we have found what it really is. With research we found a logical reson to how we are correct. Some think its from aliens, and some think its just a natural land form but what is it?

Incase you have not heard the ""face"" has been spotted on Mars, a small landform with some facial features that make it look like one. But a face from an allien, that sounds, and is unlogical. We have done so much reasarch towards this landform. Shadows give it the look of a face, and thats why we can only see it sometimes. In fact mission controllers even said you had to capture it at the correct lighting. But, if it were a real face, you could see it anytime.

In fact we have logical evedience, there are gigantic storms which would have wiped all the alliens out. They would be burried way benith the suface, becuase when Mars has a storm its vicious, and moves dust, dirt, and sediment all over. If there even was alliens they would be covered in hunderds of pounds of dust.

Yet I can see the opposing side saying that since the dust moves around so much how come the bodies couldnt be revealed? This is hundreds of pounds of dust ontop of them. Even though the dust moves so much, there a 1 and a million chnace of it moving above 400 pounds of dust.

In conclusion, this phenomim gives NASA the attention it wants, but its not true. While some might think there was alliens were on Mars, its illogical for their heads to just appear. Even though the opposers think its possible, they are dead and cannot move. Therefore the face is just a landform with shadows that make it look like a face.

b8a49b0,"Some people believed that the ""Face on Mars"" was an alien monument, and still do. This was a conspiracy theory that had been proven wrong many times by us scientists at NASA. When we first discovered this face, there was a degree of surprise among the mission controllers. But they soon figured it was another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Only this one had different shadows that gave the appearance of an Egyption Pharaoh, which caused the theories of it being an extra terrestrial monument.

When we had unveiled the photograph of the rock formation out into the public, it had been captioned that it was a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This had been done to attract attention, and it did. People began to think the Face was evidence of life on Mars that NASA would rather hide. But, our NASA budgeters wish there was life on Mars because it would benefit our investigations and bring in more money. NASA would have abosolutely no reason to hide this information from the public.

Yet, theorists are unconvinced. On April 5, 1998, we sent the Mars Global Surveyor to fly over Cydonia and to take photographs that were ten times sharper than the original photos. We first uploaded these images onto a JPL website, explaining that the Face was a natural landform and that it was not a monument built by aliens.

People were still not satisfied with our information at this point. Our mission controllers prepared to inspect the Face again. This time, our controllers used a camera that spanned 1.56 meters on the maximum resolution, which captured a breath-taking image. This image shows that the Face is an equivalent of a butte or mesa. This is a common landform on Earth, and proves that the Face on Mars is just an oddly shaped area of land.

I do understand why people may have thought that this landform was evidence of life on Mars, but us workers at NASA gave real evidence that it wasn't. Our mission controllers had taken three different images showing more and more proof that it was just another landform. The mission controllers had used cameras with extreme resolution that had the ability to see airplanes or pyramids if there were any. But there wasn't, and there still isn't.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that there is no life on Mars because there is no actual evidence proving my belief wrong.

They took aother picture of the phenomeun in full resolution, and that picture proves that the face is just a mesa or butte. The landform was even common in the United States.

Many conspiracy theorists was wishing for this to be a momunment from an anicent civilization, but the facts are agaist it. In the high resolution picture you can see the crevices in the land that make up the lanform. With the ditches and holes in the land, it causes shadows that reemble the eyes, nose, and mouth of a human. NASA would be happy to find an ancient civilization on Mars, but they look to the information first.    ",3,1,0.889459490776062
b92df25,"In 2001 an image captured by NASA finally put all of our theories away, explaining why there was a face shaped rock in the red planet, or did it? Many people have came up with many theories but the most talked about one is that there is an ancient civilization who used to be in the red planet. That theory was quickly put away after NASA captured an image in 2001. The reasons why that theory was put away are, the picture that was taken in 2001 used the absolute maximum resolution, so if there were any objects in the photo such as Egyptian-style pyramids, or even a small shack you could've easily seen what they were. The picture tooken in 2001 showed that the face on mars is the martian equivalent to a butte or a mesa- landforms common around america west. If there was an ancient civilization NASA would like to tell everyone and not hide it because its better publicity for

NASA to make such a great discovery.

First of all if their was an ancient civilization that would mean they had to make shack or pyramids to live in and in the image taken in 2001 did not capture any pyramids or small shacks in photo. If it did you would've been able to see it since the image was taken with the absolute maximum resolution so it would've been easy to see what the objects were, but there were no objects. In the photo you can only see the face not any other objects and it would be really hard to live without shelter so if their was an ancient civilization there had to be pyrmaids or shacks near that face but like I said the camera did not capture any of these things.

Secondly the image taken in 2001 showed that the face on mars is martian equivilent of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around america west. Now this could be true and may explain why the face is their. Since these landforms are common around america west it wouldn't be suprising if this is just a landform of the red planet. Many scientist have came up with this theory which is the one that has more credibility.

Finally NASA would rather it be true that there was ancient civilization living in mars since they would gain publicity. NASA would not hide this information if it was true because this would make them more prestige because they would be the ones taking full credit od the discovery and would get higer rates economically speaking. They face on mars since has become a pop icon and more when it was first discovered snd even though NASA had already said thst they figured it was a lanfdform, imagine if they say there was an ancient civilization many people would give them more publicity.

In conclusion the reasons why the face is a landform and not a whole story of how their was and ""ancient civilization"" living in the red planet are because, the picture taken in 2001 used it absolute maximum resolution so it would've captured any pyramids or shack in the background, but it didn't, also becaus ethe image taken in 2001 showed that the face on mars is martian equivient of a butte or messa which are landforms comon in america west, and finally because it would be better for NASA if there was an ancient civilization in the red planet since all the credit for the discovery being made would go to NASA ad would potentially give them more publicity and higher rates econmically speaking. So what do you think?",4,1,0.8060200214385986
b93974a,"The face in Mars is obviously just a natural landform. NASA, actuaslly have done their research on this topic while conspiracy theorists just base off the details. Now, since NASA is doing their reasearch they probably have a more than likely chance of being correct they've actually studied the object to see what it actually was. While these conspiracy theorist go with the common opinion about it floating around, and do no reasearch at all. The conspiracy theorists think that may NASA is hiding the fact that aliens have made this from the public because it may harm their budget. Taking this to 1976, camera resolution wasn't high enough to take good high quality photos yet because the technology was behind. The picture was blurry and it was one of those, ""you've got to see it to believe it"" moments because nothing could be made out from it. This is probably where that ""aliens made this"" conspiracy came from, the photo is so blurry looks as though some sort of alien space craft had landed here or the doing of aliens for artwork. Now, when you fast forward to 2001, you can obviously see more clarity in the picture. It almost looks as though this could be some alien artwork, but this is more than likely just a from a ship that has landed there and made this odd face like hole. Furthermore, if this was created by aliens it would be far more complex and wonderful than a face.

In closing, this ""face on Mars"" and the fact that it may have been created by aliens could be true. But reason rules this out, these faces are just a natural landform that were there from the beginning, human created, or were made from a landing ship.",2,1,0.8158369064331055

No one has ever been to Mars, Still to this day. Are you sure about what you are saying? I'm sure about this. Aliens live in the galaxy. They can step on any planet whenever they want to and not die.

Well I have something to say. Aliens do not exist. If they were real, they would have took over the world. They would have been making us do work every single day. f they came here they would probaly have killed us by now. Have they killed us, have they started making us do work? No, they haven't.

Grayson? Yes, Sir? I heard you and Kevin talking about how aliens made that face on mars. Both of you are wrong. You were right about the no aliens part, but everything else was wrong. We just now figured out that it was just another Martian mesa. It is common enough in Cydonia. When we took the picture, I have got a lot of e-mails saying ""what is that thing?"" I even got a e-mail from Michael Bay saying that he is going to use that image for a movie. This stuff is crazy!

Thats awesome sir! Wait, Grayson there is more. The picture is accually the Martian of a butte or mesa. It's common across the American west. I hope we can find more stuff like that. Me too that was a wierd experience.      ",2,1,0.7159260511398315

It is just shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and mouth.If what im seeing is true that there is a face on mars created by aliens i would like to know why it didnt say the same over time.No it changes just as the earth's landforms changes over time .

i would like to know if it was a creation from aliens why on earth would the do it useless they wanted us to know that the are real. I like to think of it as the same thing as vampires they wouldnt do something so bold, that we come and look for they.

In 1998 thousands of anxious web surfers waiting for the image that proved that it was just a natural landform no alien monument after all. They don't pass over the face very often so why mess with the picture if it was an alien. It's not for attention because they get a lot of attention from just going to the moon and them showing pictures of what they brought back fron space. I don't think that they would lie for attention especially if you guys think they covered it up.

People came that the reason you didn't see any alien life force is because of it being such a cloudy day. The cameras took more pictures of when it was a clear day the said thta it was clearer than the first picture,so when they took it on a clear day no alien life force was reported. So why cover it up? That's my point they wouldnt keep taking pictures if aliens were there simply because there is no aliens just science by that i mean landforms are the form of science i am talking about.

The pictures show a similars features to landforms here and one is around American West ,Middle Butte in Snake River Plain Idaho. The lava dome thta takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as Face of Mars somthey wouldn't

have the same features if it was made by aliens .In colusion i believe that they are just landforms made over time by something like the tectonics plates.      ",3,1,0.8338350057601929

I think it is a natural landform because not even humans could make something that looks just like a persons head that good. It might be from the Earths winds pushing the sand over and making it look like it a face. It also could be the gravitation pull of the Earth. I think that you should believe that is not aliens because if it was aliens dont you thinl they would be doing more than just that? That means if it reall the aliens who made this they must have a lot of thinking and knowledge about stuff like that. That also means that when earth moves the face moves with the Earth. Does this have anything to do with the man in the moon?

People probably think that it is made by aliens because people don't go to Mars. People that go to Mars have to be very brave and other things too. the camera has taken pictures because it has to have proof that it really does look like a face. I think again that it is just a landform that has been made over the pass years by the gratational pull and Earths winds.       ",2,1,0.6947081685066223

Face On Mars

Hello my name is Scientist STUDENT_NAME. I would like to tell you somemfacts about the ""face on Mars"" that me and some other scientist have discovered. You have probably heard that he face was created by aliens. You also might have heard some fact and some opinion. I am here to help you understand more about it.

First off i would lke to say people have there own opion, but when it comes to facts you cant say its wrong. I have done a lot of research over the past 24 years. We have used different objects to capture pictures over time. The Viking 1 photo shows an enormous head almost 2 miles from end to end, with a face on it.

The face became a priority to me and some scientists. The Mars Blobal Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet on in September,1997. The MGS flew over the face, Michael Malin and his Mars camera team took a picture that was 10 times sharper then the first photo. The photo revield thtthere was no alien monument at all it was a natural landform.

On April 8,2001 the MGS got close enough to get a second, bettr picture. There were no objects in the face. If there was you would be able to see them,because each picture was 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters.

So, the face is actually the Martian or a butte or mesa. Which are landforms common around American West. Therefore, the face was not created by aliens, and didnt have any object in it. Maybe you could do some more research about it .",3,1,0.8282026648521423
b99b705,"I think that the face is a natural land form because it has the features of a face, it was naturally found on the on Mars, and it was said to be a rock formation.

In this essay I willl explain the reasonings why I think its a natural landform.

This landform was found untouched on Mars.

The passage says in paragraph one that ""NASA's Viking ship 1 spacecraft was circling around the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy like ness of a human face.""

The article aslo states in paragraph seven that ""On a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

But some argure that the face was an alien artifact.

Some scientists say that

""There was an ancient civilization on Mars,""(Paragraph five). Another thing some scientists think is in paragraph eight which says ""Alien markings were hiden by haze.""

The Face might look like a face but we dont know if it really is a human face.

The face on Mars is said to be a human face.

The text states that in paragraph three NASA says

""A human head... formed by shadows giving it the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

The passage also says in paragraph one that the face was

""The shadowy likeness of a human face.

An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from the region of the red planet called Cydonia.""

Scientists have proved that it looks like a human face, but how did they prove that it was just a rock formation?

Scientists proved that the face was just a rock formation on mars.

The faceis just

""huge rock formation,"" (paragraph three) because of the picture in paragraph five.

The picture shows that the face is a big rock with shadows in it that look like a face.

The picture in paragraph five was taken by the Viking one in 1976.

The fact that some believe that it was made by aliens could possibly be true because we don't know for sure if Mars had life or not.

In this article, I thought that the face on Mars was ain fact a face because it looked like a face, it was found on Mars and it was a rock formation that just happened to form into a human face outline.

There are still some who argue that the face was made by Martians and there are some who think that it occured naturally.

No one will know for sure but in the future we willl hopefully develope equiptment that willl allow us to travel to Mars, and find evidence that will help us solve this mystery.   ",3,1,0.8652462959289551
ba2b771,"Have you ever looked in a telescope and seen the Face on Mars? Many people believe the The Face on Mars was created by aliens, but it is a natural landform. The Face on Mars is a natural landform because images from a JPL website showed the Face was a natural landform, the Face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, and if there was an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would benefit from it.

First, on April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Face for the first time. ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" (7) When a JPL website revealed the photo many anxious waiters were astounished that the Cydonia was a natural landform.

Secondly,

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program, confirmed the Face was a of a butte or mesa. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, (12) Mr. Garvin also claimed Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. (12) Which means that the Face on Mars is very similar to a lave dome, butte, or mesa.

Next, if there was an ancient civilization on Mars and they made the Face then NASA would benefit from it. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (5) This quote is explaining that if NASA knew there was an ancient civilization on Mars then they would benefit from the civilization. Why would NASA keep an ancient civilization on Mars a secret if they could benefit from the situation?

Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because images from a JPL web site showed the Face was a natural landform, the Face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, and if there was an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would benefit from it. Now do you believe the Face on Mars was created by aliens?   ",3,1,0.8614416122436523
ba60110,"I know you may think that the face was made by aliens, but it isn't. How I know? Well in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" NASA lists a whole bunch of reasons against this alien conspiracy. Number one, it is probably just another Martian mesa, which are common around Cydonia. Number two, it looks like a regular landform due to comparisons to Earths landforms. Lastly, number three, sometimes the face isn't even there due to its missing shadows. Conspirators would probably think that NASA would hide evidence of alien acts but NASA is so confident that this is not aliens that they showed the face to the public. You're probably thinking: Why should I believe you? Do you have evidence? As in fact I do.

Number one, it's probably just another Martian mesa. Scientists have proven that there are a lot of mesa's around Cydonia, a region on Mars where the face is located. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" In this quote from the text it reveals how the face, if it is just a Martian mesa, is actually rather common on Cydonia. In that quote it also reveals that the face only has ""unusual shadows"" that give the face an effect of looking like an ""Egyptian Pharaoh"".

Number two, scientists claim it just looks like a regular landform. ""What the picture acually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin."" In this quote a man named Garvin has compared the face to some landforms on Earth. By comparing the face to a landform, it makes the face acually seem more like its just a regular landform.

Number three, sometimes the face isn't even there. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Before this quote had even happened a man named Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture of the face only to realize it was just a regular landform. When the face was not in the picture that was supposed to be ten times sharper than the original Viking photo's proves that maybe the face is just a landform with unusual shadows for a face afterall.

Conspiracy theories believe that the face was made by aliens, but scientists have proven with research that that the conspiraters theory has a very big lack of credibility. Scientists have proven, number one, it is most likely just a Martian mesa with shadows for a face because Martian mesa's are common on Cydonia. Number two, its most likely just a regular landform due to its comparison's to Earths landforms. Number three, sometimes the face isn't even there because the shadows are gone. All of this resarch by NASA just proves that these conspriacy theories about aliens are wrong. Who do you believe now? NASA's research or a conspirators theory?",5,1,0.8696907162666321
ba8c337,"The natural face

I think the face is a natural landform. The article states that Scientsists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, but only this one had an unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. The scientsts flew to Cydonia for the first to take pictures of the original Viking photos. Thousands were waiting for the image first appeared on a JPL web site. The web site had revealed that the face was not an alien, but it was an natural landform.

Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times haper than the original photo. Face was located at 41 degree north matian latitude where it was winter in april, 1998. The camera showed the image and there was no alien monument after all. The picture actually shows the Marian equivalent of a butte landform common around the American West. The scientists tried it again and they just don't pass over the Face very often.

The face is an natural landform like the article said          ",2,1,0.8370471000671387
ba91a3f,"The Face On Mars is famous, known for the first phtographs of it that came out in 1976. It's a rock formation in the area called Cyndonia. It gets its name from the way it's shaped, and the fact that when light hits it the shadows make it look as though it is a face. Some conspiracy theorists think that the Face is actually an alien artifact, but there's evidence going against these claims.

The Face on Mars isn't really a face, it's a rock formation called a mesa. The Earth has mesas as well, common in places such as the American West.

Mesas are common around the Cydonia area (where the Face is located). Shadows cast on the rock give it the appearance of a face. Though it is simply a natural rock formation on Mars that just so happens to resemble a human face.

Conspiracy theorists will say that aliens on Mars created the Face, and that NASA is hiding the fact that aliens exist. These claims and accusations make no sense though. It would benefit NASA if aliens were on Mars, so there would be no reason to hide it. Back in April of 1998, NASA took another photo of the face. Since the sky was cloudly and hazy, theorists stated that if civilaztion on Mars was there, it couldn't be seen due to the fact of how hazy it was. This was debunked later on in April 8, 2001 when NASA took a better, more clear photo, where if there where any pyramids, shacks, anything hinting at the fact that Mars did indeed have aliens on its surface, you'd be able to see it, and there was nothing there.

The Face on Mars is just a natural formation called a mesa on the surface of Mars. Despite claims that the formation had been created by aliens, those claims are considered false, and cannot be backed by scientific evidence.       ",2,1,0.8856158256530762
bab0037,"Can aliens really create a face on the moon? No, they cant! I know this because the picture snapped of the face from 1976, was bit blurry, once they got abetter camera the picture became more clear and looked less like a face. Only some of the scientist beleived the face was a 'alien artifact'. There is proof that it is just a landform that looks like a face.

The picture from 1976 was a bad quality picture, it was blurry and you couldnt see much of the real features that were there. Once cameras got better and more HD the pictures got more clear and you could actually see the cracks and the rough parts if the landform. In 2001, the picture was good, it looked less like a face when the cameras got better, but it still had that face effect on it.

Only some of the scientist beleived that the face looking land form was created by aliens, not all. When they snapped the first picture in 1976, some of the scientist noticed the face and the first thing that came to there mind was that aliens did it. They started to go back and capture a picture of the face looking landform. Cyndonia became a priority for NASA when they arrived at the 'Red Planet' in September 1997.

They finnaly figured that it was just a regualr landform that had been created like face, not by aliens but by nature. The picture actually shows is the Martain equivlent of butte or mesa, those are landforms common around the American West. Scientist state that "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". Also he says ""Thats the lava dome that taks the form of isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars"".

The face on mars could have been crated by aliens though. Aliens cpuld have easily managed the curves and the ways the face looks, the nose, eyes, ears, mouth and the way it was even shaped looked like a alien head. It is very possible for it to be alins who have created this face, maybe it was a sign that aliens are here or asign that aliens know about humas.

Most landforms mostly get created about how the surroundings are or whos there. There is stuff called man made and thats made by human, but no ones ever heard of alien made. Since they used the better camera with better pixels and better HD, it turns out that the face looking lanform on Mars was just another weird looking landform, no aliens, just landform.

babf897,"Some people think that the face was made by aliens well I'll tell you right here right now that the face you are looking at is not made by aliens but just a natural cause. I will be giving you many reason why this thing on the moon has no sighn or even romotely have anything to do with aliens. One reason that i find this face to be created by nature because even the earth has these kind of landforms just look at some of the mountains just really zoomed out. If there were aliens why wouldn't they made it more defined I mean if i make something i want it to look as real as I can make it and if you look at it closly you can tell that if aliens did make it why did they make it so bad like if it's just nature it looks beautiful but if something such as aliens made this im sorry but they did very poorly because if they can make pyrimids look a pretty as they do then i think they can manage a face or some sort on a place such as the moon. There is also another reason that i say there is no way the aliens made it, how can the pyrimids stay together as well as they did but on the face on the moon fell apart with in that short of time i mean look at it from 1998 to 2001 it looks like it a bomb went off and thats only 3 years what would it look like in 100 or even 20 years. Besides we dont have any hard core evidence that aliens actually exist. When they show me some hard core hands down evidence that i can look at and say ""Wow you opened my eyes now I see what you have been talking about."" Untill then I will always believe that the face on the moon was just a natural cause and that mother nature made that face. ",2,1,0.7287312746047974
bad6c34,"The face is just a natural landform and not evidence of an alien attack. There are many reasons why this landform is only natural and not any type of alien proof. One of those is that if NASA found a secret alien civiilization they would tell us because it would help increase their budget. Another reason that it's just a natural landform is because it is just like some other natural landforms on Earth and other mesa's on Mars. The last reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that NASA is scietifically trained and would know if it was proof of alien's existence but the conspiracy theorists aren't scientifically trained and would be less likely to know exactly what it is.

The first reason that it's just a natural landform is that NASA would tell us if it was proof of an alien attack. It states in the text that ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" which shows how it would help increase their budget. Since the Face is so popular and has even become a pop icon if NASA were to find out it was proof of an alien attack they would most likely tell us because since it is so popular it would give them a significant increase to their budget. That is just one of the three reasons that I will b talking about in this essay.

The second reason that the Face is just a natural landform is because it is just like other landforms on Earth and around that area on mars. In the article it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West"". That passage from the article shows that there are landforms on Earth that look similar to that one on Mars so it couldn't be proof of an alien attack. The article also says ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh"". That shows that other landforms that resemble the Face on that part of Mars isn't uncommon. The only thing that made the Face stand out from other landforms was the shadows which made it appear to have a face that looked like an egyptian pharoah.

The third and final reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that the scientists would know better than any of the conspiracy theorists would so we should believe them. NASA has no reason to hide the Face from us because even if it was an alien attack, as I stated in paragraph two, it would help increase their budget. Other conspiracy theorists believe NASA is just trying to hide the proof of an alien attack but if that was what they were doing, they wouldn't have released a picture of the Face at all. Also when NASA realeased a new high resolution image in 2001 and a 3D altimetry of the Face, the landform no longer reseambled a face, which is proof that it is just a mesa.

Those 3 reasons are the reasons you should believe scientists and not think it is an alien landform. NASA has nothing to hide since it would increase their budget. They also are more trained in knowing what landforms on mars are than any conpiracy theorists are. The other reason is because there are many other landforms on Earth that resemble faces which could be compared to the Face. Those 3 reasons are why we should all stop trying to make conspiracy theories and just believe what NASA is trying to tell us, that it's just a mesa.         ",5,1,0.8394845724105835
badc888,"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars taken photos, when it took a photo that favored a human head. Scientist said it was common on Cydonia where the photo was first taken. They also said it isn't easy to see Cydonia, also that when the picture was taken a second time it was winter and cloudy. When the picture was taken a third time it was clear and you could tell it wasn't a face.

When the picture was first taken in 1976 scientist said that it was just another Martian mesa, which was common enough around Cydonia. This one just had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Scientist took another picture in 1998 but when that picture was taken it was winter time, so it was fairly cloudy in the sky, so you couldn't see it clearly.

Scientist said ""it wasnt easy to target Cydonia in fact it is hard work."" They said that they just don't pass over the face that often. On April 8,2001 a cloudless summer day another picture was taken. Unlike all the other pictures in this one it had the best camera and was zoomed in all the way. When the picture was taken that day you could tell that in fact it wasn't a face.

The picture that was taken in 1976 was a very serious thing and was looked at for many of years. People thought it was a face made by aliens to show life on Mars but as the pictures were taken you could tell that it wasn't. When the picture was first taken you could tell it wasn't, scientist said that was common for where it was. Also scientist said it wasn't easy to see Cydonia where the picture was taken.

baed3dd,"Face on Mars? Aliens? What? Some conspiracy theorists believe that a face found on Mars from a photo taken by Viking 1 - a Mars Global surveyor -

was created by aliens who lived on the planet over 300 billion years ago. NASA released information and a picture about the 'Face on Mars,' to the media, with the caption, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head."" The face believed to be found on Mars is nothing less then a rock formation, and was not created by aliens.

Mission controller Garvin says, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia."" He also noted that his crew does not pass over the Face very often. This rock formation is nothing more then a piece of the planet that has been wore down by the clouds on Mars. Research shows evidence that this formation has been on Mars for billions of years. Over time the wind and atmosphere has shaped the rock into the form of what looks to be a Face.

NASA leaked evidence about the Face on Mars when they unveiled the image for the public and media to see, stating clearly that the Face was formed by, ""shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting to see the image on a JPL website, the text in fact quoted, ""It was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

The people that do believe that there was alien life on Mars, think that the aliens markings were hidden by haze, and believe the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. Contarary to what skeptics and other theorists think, there is no actual piece of true evidence discovered by NASA to prove otherwise.

Garvin and his team said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyarmids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" So this actual NASA evidence that the mysterious ""Face"" found on Mars was nothing but a simple landform.

The NASA Space Program has been around for decades. NASA has not yet found evidence to consider the Face on Mars was alien artifacts. Even with NASA's best cameras, there just isn't a theoretical proven fact that this could have become an artifact from ancient aliens. The Face on Mars, is not a face, but simply a landform, that was formed over billions of years ago. ",4,1,0.9065587520599365

In 1976 a photo that was taken on mars was perceived as a face. Since it was 1976 the photo wasnt that great, but then again in 1998 and 2001 more photos were taken and they showed that it didnt resemble a face anymore due to better cameras. From the pictures in the article it looked like a face at first but then the next pictures add a bit more detail and removed some of the shadows, thus it did not look like a face. NASA also put in the caption of the image "" huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" ,this means it was just an illusion given by shadows. NASA also showed the people just to bring attention to mars and they have scientific research on the face being natural.

In conclusion the face is just a natural lanform. when you compare the photos you can see the difference in shape and detail. Some research in the article states the picture shows a martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American west. Scientist state all it really is is a martian mesa.

They think this because when NASA took the pictures of it everyone that saw it thought it was a face. Nobody thought it was just a natural landform. When it was just a natural landform called a mesa.

The reason that it is impossible for that mesa on Mars to actually be a face created by aliens is because the new cameras with a high-resolution picture looks nothing like a face just a landform. The first picture was took way back inn 1976. They didn't have cameras with th picture quality that we have now so the mesa really looks like it could be a face. But then in 1998 they took some more pictures of the face and it still kinda looked like a face but more like a landform. Then they took more pictures in 2001 with a camera that had high-resolution quality and then scientist proved that is was just a normal landform.

But their still was people that thought it was still a face the some aliens created even though scientist at NASA proved it was a mesa. But for some reason tons of people thought that NASA had something to hide. The mesa that people call the face on Mars has been in movies and newspapers because a lot of conspiracy theorists think that NASA is trying to keep the face a secret because they think nobody should know about even though the pictures prove that is just a normal landform.",3,1,0.8721623420715332

bb7db64,"In the years of 1976,1998, and 2001 photographs of a mysterious 'face' on Mars was revealed. Some people believe the Face was created by aliens. This is not the case. When the image of the Face was taken in 1998, it was released on a JPL web site, it revealed a natural landform, there was no alien monument, and when Malen Garvin's team captured a photo of the Face in 2001, you could point out things in a ditigal image three times bigger than the pixel size.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, a region of the Red Planet, and Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured an image of the Face. In paragraph seven it states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform."" Paragraph seven also states, ""There was no alien monument after all."" So, with the images revealed by Michael Malin and his team, it supports my idea that the Face is a natural landform.

Michael Malin's team snapped another photograph of the Face on April 8,2001, in which, you were able to point out things in a digital image three times larger than the pixel size, as stated in paragraph 11. For example, if there were things visible in the picture such as airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-stlye pyramids or even small shacks, you could identify what they were. If this was the case, then we could have been able to identify any strange creature in the photo, but clearly none were in sight.

In conclusion, there are many reasons to support why the Face is only a natural landform. The image taken in 1998 by Machael Malin revealed a natural landform, there was no alien monument, and in the photograph captured in 2001 by Michael Malin, you were able to discern things in a digital image three times larger than its pixel size.

That means no aliens build the Face it`s all natural.

The Face is a natural landform because it could have been it by in meteor or astroid. In outer space, there are high chances of meteors or asteriods hitting a planet like Mars, Jupiter, or even Earth. When an asteriod or meteor hit the planet,

it can physically or chemically change the surroundings of a planet. A meteor or astroid could have hit Mars; made the physical feature of Mars look like a face. It is natural for a planet getting hit by a meteor or ateriod or any type of weather storm like hurricans, earthqwakes, or even tornadoes.

In an earthqwake, the planet shakes. On Earth building falls, ground moves, and ground will leave cracks or damage. On Mars, rocks will fall and will make the illusion of a face. It will leave damage in the ground, leaving cracks in the face. This could also happen it make the Face on Mars. It is also natural.

I believe the Face is a natural landform. The results in the passage says"" There was no alien monument after all.""

An asteriod or meteor could have hit Mars before 1976. There could have been other natural causes like earthqwakes,storms, or erosion. So, the Face is a natural landform and that is were I stand on the argument.         ",2,1,0.758242130279541

In my opinion I don't think this is a face created by aliens becuase there are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. Maybe scientists have found unusaul things and claim aliens have created them but there is no proof that aliens are real.

The reason I think it is not a face is because in ""Unmasking the ace of Mars"" it said,""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this onbe had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egytian Pharoah. In the article it also says that the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

Some of the scientists in NASA believed that the Face was created by the aliens, so went there and took the same picture again. The image shows that it is a natural land form and there was no alien monument. But not everyone was satisfied, because the picture was taken during a cloudy time. Then we went to Mars to look for the same thing again, and it came out good. The picture was clear and detailed. The 2001 picture show it is familiar to human shape but it is the shadow that makes it look more like a human mask.

There is a common landform on Earth that is similar to the face of human face. Though the human face landform is on Mars, that does not mean that aliens created it.

If it was of some alian origen nasa would send a rover to check it out and get more information about it and then make it there top priority to send a maned mishion to mars to colect data and bring back as much as they could of the artifact.

Next,conspiricy therist have no proof of the artifact being of alian origen they just asume that the landformation thats sticking out of the ground is alian because it has basic facial featers besides that they have no real evidence.

It could've even have been one of their faces. This is my argument on why this face on Mars is just a natural landform and not something created by aliens.

First, in the text it says that when NASA ended up getting a picture people were not satisfied becuase they think that there wasn't enough evidence in that picture becuase it was a cloudy time on Mars. They didn't want people jumping to conclusions so they wanted NASA to send cameras out during the time of year when it was very clear. They thought that since it was cloudy and the picture wasn't too clear they think that there was evidence of alien markings were out there hidden.

Second, when they sent out the cameras on a very clear summer day, it got them a better look but not what some of the people wanted to see. In the picture it showed us that the face looked like the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. If scientists are finding common landforms, it is just more evidence that aliens did not create this realistic looking face.

Thirdly, in the text it also gives us more information to back NASA and other scientists up on this face just being a natural landform. It says that Garvin a scientist states that ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" If the landforms they are finding very similar to the Face on Mars, is showing more characteristics that are extreamly alike, it is most likely just a natural landform.

I can also understand where the people that think aliens made it are coming from. They think oh well since it looks like a face it must be a face. It also says that in the text that the Face on Mars has become a pop icon. It has starred in many things like a Hollywood film. books, magazines, radio talk shows and even , haunted grocery store checkout lined for twenty five years! So with all of that going on I can tell how you would be influenced with the internet and everything.

These are my reasonings on why the Face on Mars in just a natural landform and not something created by aliens. I hope that I got the point across on why it would be a natural landform. With all of the time, reaserch and even money that scientists and NASA have put into this, that you would just believe them becuase actual reaserch and evidnece is more factual then just some magizine or movie film. We dont even have any evidence to prove that aliens are real and that there was even life on Mars, so why would you want to beleive something that a lot of people are very optimistic and skeptical on? That is why I beleive that the Face on Mars is just a natural landorm.",4,1,0.907060980796814
bc7c899,"Certainly there are many different opinions about the Face found on Mars. Some people believe the Face was made by aliens, while other people believe it is a natural landform. I strongly believe that the Face is a natural landform because there is scientific evidence to prove that a landform could be formed on Mars and there are similar landforms like the Face on Earth.

First of all, there is scientific evidence that proves landforms can form on Mars.

For example, scientists have found that mountains, canals, and volcanoes have formed on Mars. Scientists have also found that Mars, like Earth, has tectonic plates. Tectonic plates cause many different landforms to form when they shift and move around. If tectonic plates create landforms on Earth that no human can, it should be reasonable to think that tectonic plates can be the cause of landforms on Mars.

Secondly, Mars has similar landforms to the landforms on Earth. Just like Earth, Mars has volcanoes, mountains, and canals. Scientist have found that tectonic plates are the cause of many of the landforms we see on Earth today. For example, mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide and push against each other, trying to push the opposing plate underneath. If none of the plates budge, the plates will begin to push each other up tho form mountains. For canals to form, water would have to run over the land for a while and erode the rocks until a ditch forms. Even though there isn't water on Mars now, scientist have proved that water has once been on Mars. Since water and tectonic plates cause landforms on Earth, the same elements must cause landforms on Mars as well.

Even though I believe that the Face is a natural landform, many other people will disagree with that statement. Many people with opposing viewpoints from mine will say that aliens built the face. Firstly, there is no scientific evidence to even prove the existence of aliens. Secondly, the pictures from the space crafts show no sign of any civilization near by the Face. On Earth, we may have ancient Pyramids that weren't formed naturally, but there were civilizations around those pyramids. Around the Face on Mars there is no sign of any villages or aliens living there. With a Bird-eye view, the face does't seem to have any human facial features. Only when there is a shadow, the features of a human being appear. This makes the Face seem like it was just a coincidence that it had terestrial features. With the lack of evidence to support the claim that aliens made the Face on Mars, it is hard to believe that such an idea could be true.

In conclusion, I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because there are landforms on Earth that are the same as those on Mars and those landforms were made from tectonic plates and water. I believe that you look at the evidence provided to you before you draw any conclusions. ",5,1,0.8249926567077637

The eyes,nose,and mouth are formed by clouds that give an illusion.""What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,lanforms common around the American West,"". It is a coincidence that is resembles a face but that doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

There is no reason for people not to believe scientists or NASA because there is no evdience that the ""face"" was made by aliens or that NASA and the scientists are lying to us. Everything about it is not logical and does not make sense,if there were any actual life on Mars we would of know by now. It is just a rock formation and shadows that is tricking the human eye.",3,1,0.8915035724639893
bd72301,"Alien life on Mars seems a little out of this world. If they haven't made contact with us by now what are they doing? Some of the alien hopefulls say that there are some major signs like the Face on Mars. Well it's not a sign of any sort, because of some reliable research. This resaerch includes increadible images of it from spacecraft and that its simialr to natural formations on Earth. These reasons are why the Face on Mars is just natural, not alien made.

First of all, the Face on Mars was first discovered when the Viking 1 spacecraft took pictures over the Cyndonia region of Mars in 1976. The pictures looked like an ancient Egytian face but after studying them a group at the Jet Propulsion Lab said that it was only a common mesa with shadows that played tricks on your eyes. Then again in 1998 and 2001 clearer photos of the face were taken. They showed that it was only a massive rock.

Secondly, it is been said to be a natural landform similar to those in the American West. The Face on Mars is just a butte which occurs when lava domes into an isolatd mesa. Scientist Jim Garvin says, ""It remids me most of Middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" So this ""face"" is almost like a natural landform right here on Earth acorrding to the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.

Although, these points are valid how can we tell what the Face on Mars really is untill we actually go there. For all we know the pictures are being obstructed by Martian clouds or that NASA is releasing false images. But, why would a space angency always in need of some more funding for even more research want to hurt itself by not releasing real images. Also why would NASA mess with the most clear, powerful, and detailed images of the Face that they have from not being right there hovering over the rock formation.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural rock formation with some cool shadows. There is full proof evidence that shows this to be true. There is the fact that its just like other formations in the area and on Earth and that there are some amazing pictures of it taken years apart that only get more and more detailed. Other claims do not have this kind of true scientific reaserch behind them. ",4,1,0.90517657995224

There is also some evidence on mars. Other scientist think that it could be a alien because of the artifact and photographing.

A scientist names Micheal and his camera team snapped a picture sharper than the original viking photo. People that think the face on mars is real use it for things. The face became a pop icon, it also starred in hollywood films, magazines, books, talk shows, and on grocery store check out lines.

I belive there is a Fifity Fifity chance that there isnt and that there is a alien on mars. Scientist will never know the real answer they only can prodict the correct answers. But from the research we have there the face on mars is not a alien, it is certenly a human being on the face of mars.

Why we say that ? well thats because i think that if the face was a alien face you could not perfectly see the nose, mouth, and eyes as well as you can on a human being thats why i think the face on mars is not a alien.

On a snow day have you every went outside and looked up. Well its very cloudy. Then your trying to tell me that it was a ancient alien civization. Theres no way we could get a clear picture of what it is on a snowy day. Between the camera distance from mars and the snowy day the only way you could prove that there is aliens their is by going to mars, which has never been done.

The only reason you want this to be true is because NASA would get more moeny for the disoveration of the first ancient civization that we have found. Everyday there is new story lines of ""ancient civization"" saying they have found something like this, but in the end its just a solid rock with no life.

In support snowy days equal blurry camera pictures. This picture is just showing piece of rock that was taken at the right angle at the right time to show a face.

When the ""Face on Mars"" was first discovered the Viking 1 had found it by mistake. The Viking 1 was looking for a place for its sister ship to land, and stumbled on it by mistake. The picture the Viking 1 took resembled a human face but, it was very shadowy and not the clearist picture. When NASA reveled the ""Face on Mars"" it became the instant topic everywhere. Everywhere you went peope talked about the face.

NASA wasn't done with the face on Mars. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Web sufers everywhere were whating for the first image to appear. When the imaage first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after. But of course not everyone was satisfied. Sadly it was winter it on the Red Planet. Thanks to all the wispy clouds, the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Sadly clouds had covered parts of the Face. Some people still thought the Face was hiding alien markings.

On April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. What was it going to find on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia? What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It didnt't show any airplanes or Egyptian-style pyamids.

See Bob I have so much more avidence than you. Your alein markings were proven not true. All The Face actully showed was a butte or mesa. There were no alien Egyptian style markings. The face is just a simple land form on the face of the Red Planet.",3,1,0.9047629833221436
bdbc14e,"The Face

The Face that was found on Mars couldn't have been created by aliens. If so where is the proof of these aliens. Ask yourself if you really believe the Face was created by aliens? Dont you believe their would be some sort of evidence after all of the exploring of Mars. In this essay I'm going to write a argumentive explaining why aliens could'nt have made the Face and why I belive it is just a natural landform.

I believe that this Face that was found on Mars could be a natural landform becuase of paragraph twelve. This paragraph says that the Face has resemblance to a butte or mesa, which are common landforms on Earth in the American West. It also states that it has resembalance to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These details are not exactly evidence that the Face is a natural landform, but it gives probable cause to think that it possibly is a natural landform.

For those who feel that the Face was created by aliens, dont you belive their would be some type of evidence of a life form on Earth. As paragraph eleven stated if their were other structures like pyramids, airplanes, or small shacks we would be able to see what they were because we could dicern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If their were aliens I'm sure NASA wouldn't keep it a secret because they would possibly get more donations or money from people wanting NASA to go up and get even more pictures. Or even for NASA to take people up there themselves like a trip.

Those who belive a alien created the face possibly would say that NASA would keep aliens a secret because it would frighten some people. They also could ask the question how and why did the rock or land for the way it did if its just a land form? For the first statement I can say that could be true, but the question I can't answer. I sure that someone who has studied it could though.

The alien belivers can also say that the aliens hide when humans come to Mars but that is something that can't be proven or disproven.

In conclusion, aliens couldn't have made the Face because their should be some type of proof that their has been life on Mars. Especially since we have photos of Mar's surface and have a rover on its surface. I feel that the Face is just a natural landform because it resembles a butte or mesa and because their is no sort of proof that their are aliens or any type of life form on Mars. Alien belivers could ask the question, how was the Face formed like a face, but I can't answer this question.           ",4,1,0.8695285320281982
bdc8a7d,"Many people think that the "" Face on Mars "" was created by aliens.

Due to the lack of evidence on that theory I have all the reason to believe that it is not.

Like, Earth has all these natural landforms, Mars could also have many natural landforms. NASA would even want there to be Martians.

I can also see how your mind could come to thinking that aliens are real.

To those who say that NASA is just trying to hide evidence.

When in fact, finding an ancient Martian civilization would help them, because they can be granted more money to investigate the life forms.

So, if ther was an alien we would try to capture it the first chance we have.

A big reason that I think that you just believe in aliens is you are just trying to stick with the status quo.

There is no doubt in my mind that some part of you thinks that the "" Face on Mars "" was made by aliens comes from media, movies, books, radio talk shows, and etc.

Don't tell me you don't go to the grocery checkout and see the magazine article that says, "" The Face on Mars was made by real aliens.

Like, Earth has many natural landforms, Mar could very well could have them to.

One big thing that jumps out to me is Mars has never seen a human face before, so how could they have made it.

Another fact is that Earth have landforms just like this particular Martian landform.

Those landforms are butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.

So, as you can see that all the evidence here points to the "" Face on Mars "" being just another landform.

Like, the butte or mesa.

NASA has all the more reason to want Martians.

be3dfcc,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a famous landmark on, you guessed it, Mars! Many people believe that it is just a natural landform, but others believe it was created by aliens. Why do people believe that it's created by aliens? Well, they believe that the Face is bona fide proof that there is life on Mars, and NASA is hiding something from us. In my personal opinion, I believe that it's just a natural landform that just happens to look like a face. I think that because I think the odds of aliens creating a face on Mars out of no where is very illogical. So in this essay, I'm going to prove to you that the ""Face of Mars"" is actually a landform instead of an actual alien artifact!

One of the main reasons I believe that it is just a natural landform is because according to the article, mesas are something that is common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. And since the face was located in Cydonia, it wouldn't be out of place for there to be a mesa there. So in the beginning, scientists told everyone what it really was, another Martian mesa, but it was shaped like a face. But many people noted something that was in the article in paragraph 2, where it said that the mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. My explanation for this is maybe the mesa was formed a certain way that made it have these out of place shadows, because not every mesa is alike and some may have different shapes than another. Also according to the article, it notes that very few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact, which means there are someone skeptics among scientists, and sure, scientists may be smarter than the average person, but that does not mean they are always correct.

Now we move along to even more important evidence, the pictures. The pictures are important because if you look at the picture of the ""Face on Mars"" taken in 1976, you could see that it really isn't that clear, but you can make out a face in it. But if you look at the better pictures in 1998 and 2001, you can see that they're a whole lot clearer than the ones in 1976. Right now I'm focusing on the one taken in 1998, which according to the article, it was posted on a JPL website where it was revealed as a natural landform. But skeptics again were skeptic as always, and said that since it was taken during the winter, which is a cloudy time on Mars, that the alien markings of the Face were hidden by haze. My reponse to this is, if there were alien markings, why couldn't you make a brief outline of them in the picture from 1976? And how do you know for sure that there are any alien markings? Many questions arose and taken pictures of the Face became a priority.

3 years later, on April 8, 2001, another picture of the Face was taken. This one was much clearer than the one in 1998 due to there being no clouds. According to the article, the pxiel size in the image was 1.56 meters, and as rule of thumb, if there were any alien markings or another of that sort, they would've been able to be seen in the picture because of the pixels. So the ""Face on Mars"" was got rid of its skeptics and now many scientists say it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. According to the article, Garvin says it remind him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, because it is about the same height of the ""Face on Mars"".

So in conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is a mesa plain and simple, and the main reasons are because of the pictures, and overall the really big reason many mesas are common around Cydonia, which is where the Face is located. Another reason why I don't think that you should believe that it is an alien artifact is, there is so much evidence to why it isn't whenever people just pointed out obvious things in the picture, like clouds of haze covered ""markings"" in the 1998 picture but there weren't ever markings on the mesa as revealed in the next picture taken in 2001. So to end this essay, the ""Face on Mars"" is a mesa, not an alien artifact as many skeptics believe.               ",6,1,0.9218120574951172

""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The Face on Mars is a natural landform because landforms happens on most planets with solid ground, and Mars is a planet that has landforms, too.

In the article, it says, ""Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Aliens did not create the Face, but the planet itself did, Mars. People on Earth were nervous because the landform on Mars resembled a human head, in which they called the Face.

bea37ee,"I am Dr.Monroe, a scientist here at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Otherwise known as NASA. A very popular space agency. Twenty five years ago something very odd happened around around Mars. We had one of our spacecrafts (Viking 1) circling mars, and taking pictures of possible landing sites for another one of our spacecrafts (Viking 2). Later on, we found that Viking 1 had snapped a picture of what seemed to look like a human face. We were very excited to find out what this new finding was, but we later found out that it was just a Martian mesa. Very common around Cydonia. Only this particular mesa had very outrageuos shadows, that made it look like a face.

Though we have stated before to the world that this was just a Martian mesa, some people thought otherwise. For example, one day I was sitting at a coffe shop nearby where I worked with my labcoat on. On my labcoat, it stated my name, and in big letters, the word: NASA. Like I was saying, I was in a coffe shop nearby where I worked, and was suddenly approached by a young man in his twenties. He stood there for a while making sure that I acknowledged him. When I did finally notice him, he smiled, and said that his name was Stan. He told me that he noticed my labcoat and where I worked, and wanted to bring up the topic ""The Face"". I chuckled at his comment, and agreed to discuss the topic.

He sat down in the chair across from me, and we started talking. He brought up how he thought that we were hiding something to do with the face. I kindly replied that we weren't, and that we explained to all the news stories, and talkshows, that this ""face"", was just a simple Martian mesa. Even when I said this, he disregarded it, and continued speaking about how he thought that this picture of ""the Mesa"" was proof of extraterestrial life on mars. as soon as he said this I burst out with laughter. Tears were falling from my eyes, as I thought this was a joke. but, when i saw that he was serious, I immediatley stopped laughing, and apologized. i explained to him that the picture of what he thought was a face, really was just ""the Martian equilavent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west"". At this time he then grabbed something from out of his satchel (which i hadn't noticed before) which looked like a picture of some sort. As a took a closer look, i saw that this was actually three pictures on one page.

The pictures that he showed me were pictures of "" The Face"" in chronological order from 1976 to 2001. He then said to me that that it was possible for alien markings to be hidden. I peered at him with a strange face trying to figure out why this was so important to him, but i answered his question. I stated that ""The Face on mars was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of the year on the red planet"". even after this was said he shook his head with a tiny smirk on his face. I then grew annoyed at him and then pointed to the third picture taken in 2001. "" Do you see here?"" ""In image three we used a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If there were anything else on this landform other than rocks such as alien markings, you would've seen it already."" He stared at me with a look of stupidity on his face as i then had a smirk on my face. I was proud of myself for proving him wrong.

After our little argument, he quietly got up from his seat, shook my hand, said nice to meet you, and walked out of the coffe shop. I then realized the time and walked out as well, and went back to work.",3,1,0.8208776116371155

bf00ad9,"The Face on mars was a big controversy throughout the 1970's to 2001, and still is a popular topic of conversation. Many people believe NASA was trying to hide an alien artifact by saying it's a land form, and others believe thats all it is, a landformation. NASA has been photographing this for years, trying to figure out exactly what it is, and trying to satisfy the conspiracy theorists. In 1976, they were taking photos of a region of a planet, and discovered this strange formation with the look of a face. NASA continued to research and take photos. After years of photographing and talking, they finally figured it out.

NASA discovered in 1998, that what many people thought was an alien artifact, was actually just a landformation. From the beginning, the NASA workers had two theories. Some scientists thought the Face was an alien artifact, and most thought it was a mesa, which is a natural land formation. The second theory was right, that all it was was a strange land formation and bad camera quality. There are photos that show the 3 pictures they took of the Face. One was in 1976. That was a time where most people thought it was an alien artifact, because it looked most like a face because of the blurry quality. In addition, the next picture from 1998 showed was it really was, just a land formtion. The third, from 2001, proved people who thought it was from aliens wrong. If you examine the photos closely, you can see that there are cracks in the land, that if angled the right way with clouds in the way, can show the illusion of normal face features, like eyes and a mouth. In comparison that to the photo taken in 2001, it is obvious it's nothing more then land.

Before the photo in 2001, people still thought it was an alien artifact. An article stating that, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars,"" proves a point. Why would NASA not want there to be aliens on other planets when it would benefit them so positively. If NASA really thought there were aliens, why would they show the photos to the whole world? When the first photo came out, NASA stated, ""a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. They put out the photo to attract attention to mars with that caption. It explains what the formation is and how it may be mistaken as something other than rocks.

In this paragraph, a scientist explains the mesa and compares it to a landform on earth.

In the end, the Face ends up just being a landformation, though many people hoped it would be a discovery of alien life. The photos proved that it was nothing more then a rock formation. NASA researched to find the land formation and made it clear that they also wanted it to be an alien artifact. All of the conspiracy theorists have been proven wrong, and the mystery has been solved.  ",5,1,0.9170060157775879
bf348d8,"On May 24, 2001, Mars was the topic of conversation with those at NASA and other space stations who were included on the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission. On that day, the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. On the other hand, its sister ship, Viking 2, spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. According to Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, the face on Mars resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. But one argument leaves many citizens guessing: Is the face on Mars a true natural landform?

Most at the NASA space station argue that the face is in fact a true natural landform. The face would be considered a natural landform because there isn't actual proof that aliens had created the landform. This statement meaning that there isn't, for example, video footage proof of the landform being created by aliens, which could have been something that could prove that the face is either natural or unnatural. Another reason why this face could be a natural landform is that no one has actually lived on Mars, so no one could stand up and say whether or not it's natural. For the face to be natural, Mars itself would've had to go through natural causes such as erosion or a quake for the face to be created.

On the other hand, it's easy to see why people would think that the face was created by aliens. In the history of the world, many peculiar events have happened where nobody knew how they happened. For example, all over the Earth, there have been cases of weird patterns appearing in corn fields and mazes. People would say that the patterns were created by aliens, so many just say that weird occurences are due to weird, foreign beings: Aliens. Furthermore, another reason why people would think that the face was created by aliens that ties into the other side of the argument is that since no human being has lived on Mars, there is no factual evidence that states that the face was created by natural causes or by aliens; but since aliens live on Mars and other planets in space, people are forced to make the conclusion that aliens made them.

In conclusion, some people don't even have an opinion and they just believe the scientific evidence over the belief that aliens had created them. People might believe this evidence because some people, in fact, don't even believe in aliens at all. But the face could very well be a natural landform due to natural causes such as erosion of the planet or quakes in Mars that formed the face. Or if there are aliens on Mars, the face-according to some people- could've also been created by aliens that lived on Mars. But according to the scientists and chiefs at NASA, the Mars Exploration Program, and other space stations involved in the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission, the face on Mars was only created by natural occurrences and they try to get people to believe it by plastering it all over Hollywood movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines.

bf92249,"Some people think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens but that's not the case. After some research, here are the reasons why it's just another natural landform and not an alien artifact.

First, scientists figured it to be just another Martian mesa which was common enough around the Cydonia. There have been plenty before and this is just another one of them and the fact that it looks like an Egyptian Pharaoh is just a coinsidence.

Second, on April 5,1998, when Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took some pictures that were ten times sharper than the first, it showed the face was nothing but a natural landform. There wasn't an alien artifact after all.

Nevertheless, on April 8,2001, Mars Global Surveyor took a second picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. No matter how or when or where the picture was taken, it showed the face to be a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are landforms common around the American West.

Overall, the Face on Mars is just another landform but we can't really blame people for thinking what they did because alien myths have been around for years and years.But the fact that Garvin said,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho"", not only shows but explains that there are many natural landforms on earth and so why can't there be any on another planet, especially Mars because that's a planet that has almost everything that humans need to survive and prosper.

""The Face of Mars"", all it is is a martian mesa. these are very common around cydonia. All that this one had was a weird shadowing effect. Our eyes can change to what we know son that is make sense, that why everyone saw a face we also put what we know to something we have no clue on if it help explain it.

The face is just a normal landform. This ""Face of Mars"" is just like landforms on earth. Some may just look like common things we see everyday. you can't just assume that since it look like someone made that it couldn't be is an natural made landform.

The picture of ""The Face of Mars"" everyone says looks like a face is such a low resoution it's only 43 meters per pixel. The more resent picture is 1.56 meters per pixel. With the 1.56 meters per pixel you can see more of what's on the surface compared to the 43 meters per pixel.

From the low resoultion to it just a normal landform. From the fact that it looks like other landforms when in a better picture to there's not enough information for it being a alien made object. Theres so many reasons why this not anything more. ",3,1,0.8561257719993591

The mask is a natural landform, however many other people beleived it was an alien because they also beleived that some of the markings were in haze, as it states in paragraph 8. The Mars Global Surveyor took a second look it says in paragraph 10. They captured a picture that was in a high pixel quality and they found it to be the best picture taken of the mask.

Many people beleive that the mask is made by aliens on Mars. They beleive this because it looks like the face of a alien or even maybe a human being as it states in paragraph 8. Many people don't beleive it being possible for the mask to be a natural formation. There is lots of debate over this but science has proved that these people are wrong because it is a natural artifact.

bfb3334,"This special artifact that was found on Mars might have been created by aliens, or a Martian mesa. On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 was circling around mars. Something different happened that made TV, magazines, even Hollywood. Viking 1 captured a picture of a FACE on mars. At the time no one knew what made this but NASA did have plenty enough of ideas to figure it out sooner or later.

An argument would be is are aliens actually real or are they a mythical creature that people say is real. The man NASA is talking to would have to find out himself and so would NASA. NASA has plenty enough cameras in space to know if there are actually aliens up in space. This could have been created by a Martian mesa. The face might of had many weird, or unusual shadows.

The only problem would be is there aliens in different Galaxies, or on different planets like the ones in our Galaxy the Milkyway. The Aliens could have flew over and made a face on Mars, or carved it themselves. The problem with the Martian mesa is the shadow could have been created by the camer or ship that was flying around the planet Mars.

The was to prove them wrong though is, we have been studying and flying cameras out into space for awhile and have been searching for aliens the whole time. NASA's cameras are still in space and they are still searching. The Shadow was to large to be created by the ship or camera that was flying around mars. The shadow could have been around Cyndonia which is common.        ",2,1,0.838204026222229

Why would there be a big face that looks like a rock with shadows of the surface of mars an people say there is life there. I say there wouldnt be life there because there would be no living anything on the planet just like every other planet. If there was living stuff on one planet wouldnt you think that there would be other proven facts that there is life on other planets? Which there isnt. Just like peoples imagination when we see stuff that we dont really see, like when sometimes you are looking at a cloud an you see a object because you think it might look like a animal or a living thing in the cloud but you arent really seeing the thing its just your imigination. I think thats the same thing that happened with the mars face because the poeple who too the pictures had a great imagintion, an it might of only been the obove view that made it look like a face because somtime when we look at something a different way or up close then it looks way different then it dos from the top view. I believ that it was just the peoples imigenation an the way the poeple looked at it from the view they were looking at it.

c060418,"Now you may have heard of something on Mars that looked like a huge rock formation. You may have thought it was created by aliens, but here at NASA I am here to tell you that it's just a mesa.

Well in 1976 we discovered something on Mars that looked like a face! At first we thought it was something like what you think now, we thought it was aliens. The excitement was short lived for us because we ended up saying that ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa"" so that made it disappointing for us. You may say that the landform is created by aliens and we're just hiding it from you, but you're sorely mistaken because this discovery would help NASA as a whole if we did reveal it. That's just one of many reasons that we aren't lying about it being a landform.

Another reason that we are completely sure it's a landform is because we can't spot any sign of life on the face. As we said ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" So even if you thought we were lying saying ""Oh this image is a lie they have secret ones that actually show that there's life on Mars in their building,"" you would have no clue that there's no reason for us to hide life being on Mars. We wouldn't have anything bad happen to us because we discovered life on Mars we would get rewarded for discovering life on Mars so why would we hide it?

And the last reason is that we have factual evidence and credibility to back up that there's no life on Mars. Like we said during this speech we said that ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" Later on we did it again in the speech ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

c0b4881,"According to my scientific studies done at NASA, this landform is natural. It is not made by aliens. I have done much research in my day as a scientist at NASA, and I know that plates on a surface can shift land due to forces, and that is why I do not believe this ""face"" was made by aliens.

I believe this face on Mars is natural because aliens are not real. This face on Mars just happens to look like a face. In my experienced years of being a sceintist, I know people get fired up about things that are not supposed to look like something else but they do. This is a perfect examle of just that! This face is naturally made, but because it looks like the face of an Egyptian Pharaoh, it is different. Just because it looks like something does not mean that aliens or something else that is creapy made it. This landform just happened to look like a face. That is that. There is not enough evidence to support that aliens made the Pharaoh-face landform, so for now, let us consider the face naturally made.

Overall, I believe this face is naturally made. There is no evidence that supports the fact that aliens went to Mars and made a face on the surface so the entire planet Earth could see it and become curious. On the other hand, there is more evidence to support the scientific theory; The landform is naturally made. Aliens are not real, and there is litle to no evidence to support the alien theory. Until someone comes to me and finds supporting details about aliens creating this landform, I will not change my thoughts and views on the whole situation.   ",3,1,0.8348087072372437
c0d358b,"Although you have made good points concerning the landform on Mars, I would like to respectfuly disagree on your opinion that aliens are responsible for the bulilding of Cydonia.

In the passage, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", the author has quotes comparing the face, Cydonia, to natrual landforms on earth such as moutains and messas. Through the passage and its comparrisons, we can infer that the ""face"" on Mars is, in face, just made up of natrual causes and the impact of the weather. If you really think and dig deeper, the picture of the face could resemble moutains or small hills posted, or positioned, relativly close together so that the image of a face is possible.

Lastly, the reason as to why Cydonia is in fact just a landform is the way that the author writes the passage. NASA very briefly mentions the possible outcome of aliens, but other than that nothing else has been said about the ""could be"" creatures. They must not be firm believers. Which leads me to the conclusion that is, if NASA had discovered aliens wouldn't that make them most popular? The discovery of new life would, without a doubt, be absolutly fantastic for NASA and its image. The thought that there might be life on Mars is a good enough situatiion to lie and say that you did find life only to have your buisness in the tabloids. We can all infer that is if NASA had discovered that Cydonia had been built by aliens American citizens would be the first to know. You cant hide something like this that would make your buisness so sucsessful.

In conclusion, we can infer that Cydonia is, in fact, a landform of some sort on the face of Mars. We know this through the discussion that landforms are built with natrual causes, not aliens, and that if the face were to be built by aliens it wouldn't be hidden from citizens knowing that the discovery could boom multiple buisnesses.

There are a great deal of reasons to believe that the Face is just a natural landform. First, what evidence do the people that say it was created by aliens have. To make people believe that te Face was created by aliens, they have to have something to prove it. Then, there are comparisons to landforms on Earth that are very similar to the Face that was found on Mars. They also have no alien markings to prove that aliens made the landform.

There are many reasons to support my claim. Some say that it was too cloudy to see any markings. But the ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" The spacecraft was rolled 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. The team had an ""extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Using a camera that good, people would be able to see anything resembling any alien markings.

'So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the gorund or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'"" This shows that even when people from NASA zoomed in on the face to get a better look at it, they couldn't find any sign of alien life which means that there is a very low possibility that there are aliens that could've done this.

Another reason that shows that aliens couldn't have done this is when the passage says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfurs were waiting when the image first apperared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" If scientists at NASA have studied this face and taken many pictures but still can't find any type of alien life, then there isn't any.

The last piece of evidence that shows that aliens didn't make the Face is when the text says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

Most scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa like they see on other planets.I believe it's just a natural landform.

c17082b,"Have you ever seen an illusion where it looked like a figure, but then you realize it was just something else?

Everyone has had that happen, and that is because your brain is being fooled. Recently, research shows that your brain assumes something when it looks like what you think of. For example, the pop icon, known as the ""Face of Mars,"" has fooled many scientists as NASA, making them believe that aliens were trying to give out signals. Unlike the other scientists, I believe that this ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform that looks similar to a human face.

First of all, I believe that this peculiar face was made from the winds on Mars. It is true that when erosion occurs on Earth, tiny sediments of rocks are moved away from the original rock. I believe that erosion also occurs on Mars because a rock that looks like a face does not show up all of the sudden. Also, as you can see in the picture Viking 1 photographed, you can see tiny holes on the forehead of this rock. It is my opinion that this rock was eroded at some time and started to form a figure of a face.

Secondly, the picture resolution of the rock was not as clear as it is today. So because of the resolution, the image looked similar to a human face.

Also, at the time of 1976, scientists still believed in the theory of aliens. However, about 22 years later, the workers at NASA captured the image of the rock again, but this time they used higher resolution. Then scientists were putting it all together by finding out that this rock was not a signal coming from Martians. So because of the resolution of the picture, the sceintists assumed that the rock came from aliens.

However, just because this face-like rock is from aliens doesn't mean that the theory of aliens isn't true.

There are still many beliefs that aliens exist. For example, in 1957, there was a group of aliens coming toward a farmer. However, they left Earth and there were no other signs of aliens from then. Then there was the flying saucer in the sky in 2013.

Many people assumed that it was a UFO, and there are still some research about that incident today. So even though that there was no sign of life on Mars, there has to be life somewhere out in the universe.

In conclusion, people still believe that the ""Face on Mars"" still came from aliens. Some people are like me, who believe that the rock was formed from erosion and that scientists didn't have the resolution at the time to figure out that it wasn't really a human face.

c173c02,"The ""Face of Mars"" was a huge discovery for the scientists at NASA. Not because of the discovery of Cydonia's face, but rather the attention and funding NASA recieved due to peoples' anticipation of aliens on Mars. The face has been confirmed, by NASA, to not be an alien structure; however, conspiracy theorists and people in denial think what NASA says is a lie.

It is a fact that the Face of Cydonia is only a unique natural landmass (Paragraph 1) The search for the truth of Cydonia started in 1976 when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and was snapping pictures for where its sister ship, Viking 2, could land. the Face of Cydonia was spotted when the Viking 1 circled the region of Cydonia. The face resembled a shadowy likeness of a human face. (Paragraph 2) After the image was surveyed by the mission controllers in the Jet Propulsion Lab, there was an assumed uproar of excitement; however, after all the excitement, Scientists figured it out. It was another Martian Mesa that had a unique resemblense of an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh.

With all this information, people should've been convinced but some still weren't. Scientists over at NASA have come out with the original 1976 image of Cydonia's face. Later on more information had come out and on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original and it gave even more evidence of the face being a butte. People who weren't convinced, or conspiracy theorists, still believe the Face of Cydonia is pure evedience of Aliens even after the second picture.

The Face of Cydonia, factually, is a landmass. For all you people who still don't believe that, you have all the evidence to counter your claims. For example, in paragraph (5), it states that some people like you believe the face of Mars is ""Bona fide"" evidence of life. you believe that the U.S Government, with NASA, would rather hide any evidence to support the claim of aliens. to counter your claims, NASA used your tax dollars by funding a third expedition to Cydonia. In paragraph (10), it states that on April 8, 2001, NASA took the Mars Global Surveyor close enough for a second look. They found Cydonia's Face and snapped a picture ten times better, in resoulution, than the last one and they gathered even more evidence supporting their claim. Lastly, you conspiracy theorists say NASA is hiding eveidence, yet they gave everyone the images from 1976, 1998, and 2001, with the dates they were taken; even with, the resoulution, camera name, and the pixel size.

In conclusion, all of you conspiracy theorists' counter-arguements have no evidence to back them up; however, NASA has all the evidence of the Face of Cydonia, being a Martian landmass. NASA also has given everyone the eveidence they even gathered. The Face of Cydonia was an exciting discovery, but people who were too excited, were angry with the truth; as a result, conspiracy theorists and defenders of the NASA budget came out in an uproar of denial.

This Egyptian face was, in fact, not made by aliens like many have believed. The ""Face of Mars"" is actually a lava dome that formed like a butte/mesa roughly the same height as Mar's surface. A butte ot mesa is a landform that is common around the American West. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" (p.2) Therefore the ""face"" we see is shadows casting over the butte/mesa shaped lava dome creating the image of a human face. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" says Garvin. (p.12)

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" was not the work of aliens, but only a lava dome at the surface of the Red Planet. There are many who would still disagree, but NASA has researched and proven the ""Face"" was not made by aliens.",3,1,0.7950276136398315
c1c1d81,"If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens I would tell them it was not created by aliens. That's how it was formed just because it's formed that way doesn't mean it was created by aliens. I believe it was just formed like that and there's nothing wrong with it being formed like it's formed because in the article it says, a ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth"".

First of all, In May 24,2001 in the artcile it says,"" It was twenty five years ago something happened around Mars. Viking 1 which is NASA's spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face"". Secondly, It also says in the article,"" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the images appeared on JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. Thirdly, There was no alien monument after all."" But not everyone was satisfied they needed more evidence to believe that there were no aliens that created the Face on Mars. Lastly, the Mission controllers prepared to look again and make sure that aliens didn't create the Face on Mars It was hard work but they did the mission anyways.

If I was a scientist that's what I would discuss about the Face on Mars because I feel like that it wasn't created by aliens it was just a natural landform like the article stated. I believe it was formed like that because of God he forms things not aliens. That concludes what I would discuss if I was a scientist discussing about the Face on Mars and who thinks it was created by aliens.",3,1,0.8788909912109375

Thats when people start to think ""How did this face on a planet we know little to nothing about desapear of the span of 25 years.""Thats where conspiracy therios come in,and then we get protesters and signs say""NASA is lying""then we get no funding because of the conspiracy. the point here is that this is a perfectly scientific,logical phenomena that we can explain with a simple theroy. Erosion of time is one of the reasons there are so many land slides or avalanches. The mars ""face"" may have been a face at one point because it is a landform. Erosion is a simple little matter of eroding and object over time with the natural elimates and/or manmade objects. That is why The face on mars is not a face but Just mesa or a butte.",3,1,0.7882156372070312
c1efcae,"We all know there are 7 wonders of the world, but could this be the first wonder of the universe. Nature can make some astonishing things. Many things in the world, or even the universe, are nature-made. They have been here since the beginning of time even though they seem to be man-made. The ""Face"" should be included in this category. This ""Face"" was created by natural processes.

Similar to the ""Face"", places on Earth are nature-made. Even though sand dunes on beaches are kept by humans, they were first nature-made. Sand storms on Earth create higher dunes in deserts because the starting dune blocks the sand from getting across it. This may be what caused the ""Face"" to be created. There may have been an oval shaped dune at that spot, and, then, a ""storm"" passed by. The beginning dune blocked the Mars sand from exceeding that barrier, and the ""Face"" we see now was created. The shadows forming the eyes, nose and mouth were created on accident.

Sometimes landforms are created when objects collide with planets. The ""Face"" could have been formed when a meteor crashed into Mars. Only this time the crash did not create a crater, but instead a protruding object that over the years got rounded out by storms. Evidence does not suggest that every single meteor strike causes a crater. The reason that craters are an effect on Earth may be due to Earth's atmosphere or it's magnetic field. This may just be the first time NASA has ever seen a mound created by a meteor strike. There could be more out in the universe that NASA hasn't observed yet.

In April of 1998, a photo was taken that was blury due to Martian clouds. Many people exclaimed that the clouds may have blocked some alien markings. When NASA took another photo in April of 2001, the photo does not seem to portray any alien markings. Furthermore, the ""Face"" looked as though it has cracked on the side. Suggesting that there are Martians on Mars and, along with that, there were Martians that made this ""Face"", why wouldn't the Martians fix their monument when it cracks. This led me to believe that not only did the ""Martians"" on Mars not build this, but, additionally, there are no Martians on Mars.

Others may say that, comparative to the Mound Builder Indians on Earth, the ""Face"" was created by Martians bringing dirt to one spot and creating that ""mound"". If that was the case, then how come, in all of the photos and evidence we have from Mars, NASA has never once seen a Martian. They might be hiding from us, but, like Humans, couldn't Martians have messed up, and they forgot to hide one time.

This ""Face"" is created by natural processes. Even though it has been extremely controversial over whether it is alien-made or nature-made, more evidence suggests that the ""Face"" is nature-made. Many things in the universe can cause a mound on a planet, but finding out which one is the cause of the ""Face"" may never be known.",5,1,0.7302206158638
c1fb803,"The face on the moon is a cool thing. Most people think that it was created by aliens. The face on the moon is just a natural landform and was not created by aliens.

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team went and snapped a picture of the face ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. Thousand of anxious web sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealling that the face on the moon was a natural lanfdorm. There was no alien monument after all.

On April 8, 2001, they went for a second look. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They got got right in front of the the face. Malin's team captured an extraodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. It showed no alien sign. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms commonaround the American West. It is reminded most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Pain of Idaho.

So it turns out the face on the moon is not something created by alien but, it is a natural landform.The face is a cool thing that formed a long time ago.   ",2,1,0.863774299621582
c1ffeb5,"The Face

Some people belevie that the landform is a face, but they need to face the facts. The face is that hte ""face"" is just shadows on a landform. NASA has discovered that the ""face"" is like a butte or mesa on earth which are landforms common around the American West. In 1998 NASA captured photos that revelad that it was just a natural landform, and in 2001 using the camera's highest resoluton on a clear day the photo comfires this. Some people might say that NASA is trying to hide the fact that there is alien life on Mars, but they need to look at the fact that NASA would love that and would benefit form finding alien life. All together NASA has the evidence to suppor the fact the the ""face"" is just a landform.

First off, NASA has discovered that the ""face"" is just a butte or mesa commonly found in the American West. In the article it states, ""'It reminds me moost of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,'says Garvin"". This shows that NASA's cheif scientist for it's Mars Exploration Program knows it is just like a butte or mesa. This means that a person who sees things like this on a daily basis knows that it is just shadows making a land form look like something else. If a cheif scientist knows that it is just a landform than that means that we should have no problem understanding what it is.

Secondly, in 1998 NASA captured photos that it was just a natural landform. NASA was able to look at the pictures of the same area and tell that the ""face"" wasn't created by aleins, but was just a ""freak of nature"". In the text it states ""Michael Malin and his Mars Obiter Camera tteam snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photo"". This shows that the picture in 1998 was much mre clear and that shadows caused the ""face"" on Mars. The original camera used by the origianl Viking team cannot compare to the one used in 1998. The original photo that showed the face happened because of a horrible camera and shadows. With this evidence about the camera it confirms that the ""face"" is just a landform.

Lastly, people complained that the photo in 1998 didn't show all of the landform because of the clouds in the wasy, so in 2001 on a clear summer day Malin's team captured a new picture. The text reads, ""'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution"". This shows that the team took the best photo on the best conditions possible and once again proved that the ""face"" is a landform. Malin who is a professional took two pictures that prove that the ""face"" is not a face at all yet, a natural landform that looked like a face from the shadows. With the evidence from the maximum resolution camera it is easy to see that the ""face"" is a land form.

On the other hand, some people say that NASA is hiding the fact that there is alien life on Mar's. These people have absolutly no evidence to support that claim. NASA is struggeling with budget cuts would have mush more funding for finding alien life so that atomaticaly throws out the possibilty of NASA iding alian life. The consporacy theorists also have no evidence to support their claim. NASA has taken multiple photos that show that the ""face"" is just a landform like a butte or mesa (which are most common in the American West). With all of the information pointing the other way consiparcy theorists have nothing to go on to support their wild claim.

All in all, the evidence only supports that the ""face"" is just a natural landform. The ""face"" resembels a butte or a mesa, and NASA has taken multiple high quality pictures that prove that it is just a landform. Although somepeople might disagree, the ""face"" is just a simple landform and will look the same way for years to come.",6,1,0.864119291305542
c20344e,"In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a picture that looked like the resemblence of a human face. NASA showed the picture to the public and it definitely drew attention to Mars. Some conspiracy theorists believe that the Face Viking 1 found is evidence of life on Mars, but NASA later came out and said that the face was actually just a landform, a mesa. I believe that the Face is a natural landform because, a clearer picture confirms this, it is similar to landforms of the American West, and NASA wouldn't hide that life was found on Mars becuase it would benefit them.

The Face was not created by aliens, becuase a clearer picture taken in 2001 shows it's just a landform. In the article it states, ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" NASA used their best equipment to make sure they would be accurate when discovering what the Face really was. Also, in the article it states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Sometimes when you see something at first it looks like something odd, but when you take a closer look it turns out to be something ordinary; that's what happened in this situation.

Another reason, why the Face wasn't created by aliens, is becuase it's just like any other landform. In the article it states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" Like I said previously, the Face turned out to be a landform, and the landform itself isn't something specatacular, it's just an ordinary landform. It is something that is common, that just formed like the mountains and plateaus in North America today.

Finally, a formation created by aliens would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide that. If it was made by aliens and there really was life on Mars, wouldn't NASA be excited and telling the public about it, since it would promote their company? The answer is yes, they would, which is why I believe they are telling the truth that it is just a butte or mesa. The article states, ""Some poeple think that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars."" This proves my point that NASA would be be thrilled and want to tell everyone about life on Mars, if there really was.

In conclusion, I think the Face found on Mars was just simply a natural landform. There is more evidence that proves this than there is that proves it was made by aliens. Taking a closer look at it you can clearly tell it is just a landfrom, it is similar to landforms of the American West, and proof of life on Mars would benefit NASA, so they wouldn't hide that information. This shows why I believe the Face found on Mars is just a landform, and was not created by aliens.",5,1,0.9214891791343689

I believe it is a landform on Mars that appeared to look as if it were a face. A team was also sent to Cydonia to take clear pictures of the artifact to see weather it was an alien artifact or a land form.

The pictures were uploaded on JPL for others to see, which they revealed that it was just a landform. Although the landform looked as if it were a face, but it was just an illusion to look like one.",2,1,0.8935786485671997

c236426,"The face on Mars is just a natural landform. When they took the picture it first looked like a face. Many people wondered if it was an alien made landform. It ended up being just a plain old landform on the red planet.

Many people at first were freaked out or amazed of at the face on the red planet. The story and face appeared in movies, radio talk shows, the web, social media, and magazines. But after they sent out more ships to take pictures of the land form they got a better shot. The picture looked like a natural landform. In the article it says in there ""...a natural landform."" The scientist at NASA also figured out that it was cloudy on the red planet when they took the picture. ""The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was April '98- a cloudy time of year on the red planet.""Some of the cloud or mist could of been right over the landform when the picture was taken.

As you can tell from the evidence provided the Face on Mars is not really a face. It is just a landform on the red planet. It was cloudy the day they took it.

I do believe that at first you would probably think that an alien created this but after many scientists researching and exploring the ""face"" they clearly stated ""this face reminds us most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plan of Idaho.""

Just like Earth is a plant Mars is also a planet,, and just like Earth has natural landformation many other plants have natural landformation not just Earth.

In the articule it states ""the rock formation even has eyes, nose, and a mouth,"" I personaly do not think that an alien could create something with such details.

Not just in Mars, scientists and explorers have found many natural landformation.

After all that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter studied they finally found out that the ""face"" was just a natural landformation.

All the scientists and people who believed it was an alien still wanted to research more beacuse they didn't believe that it was a landformation, this is based on what I have heard.

Again what this image acutually shows is the Martian of a butte or mesa landforms common around the Ameriacan West.

NASA's Viking 1 first photographed the formation in 1976, the formation described as ""An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end.""

When NASA reavealed the image to the public a few days later, claims of alien life began surfacing. The article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' stated that ""The Face on Mars had since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" The media blew up at the idea of the Face being signs of intelligent life forms on other planets, despite what the scientists had to say about what the face truly was.

Eighteen years after the Viking missions ended, the Mars Global Suveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time (Cydonia is the area of mars where the face was discovered) a mars orbitor team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a matural land form, not an alien monument at all. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia on a clouldess summers day, managing to get close enough for the Mars orbitior team to capture an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Jim Garvin, cheif scientist of Nasa's exploration program says As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! The picture of the Face is actually showing the Martain equivellent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Despite what the media has to say about the Face on Mars, it is nothing more than a natural landform. Ever since NASA realeased the images, they have been under a magnifying glass. Conspiracy theorists have claimed that the face is anything but a natural land mass, evidence of aliens, yet the scientists at Nasa have time and time again proven them wrong. As we explore the great unknown, we stumble onto unfamiliar and strange things and ideas. As exciting as an alien monument would be, the face is nothing more than a natural landform on the great red planet.

c28e6b8,"Do you really thing a land form could make a face ? To me that seems something is very unlikely. A planet that we do not look alike can make a face as a organism on earth? Well i don't think so and here is why.

The photo isn't clearly shown as a face it just looks like a planets land form.

It may aslo be a feture that is only unique to this palnet like the moon has thousands of craders. I just feel as if Earth has all the water and green grass on it mayb Mars has these land forms instead. Also it might be like how people gaze at the stars or the clouds to see if they make an object or a human face. If you look closley you can see that the

""face"" has ridges or canyon. So maybe the ridegs/canyons made the land form that way.

NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face. They also believe it is an alien artifac. According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth. They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years.

In conclusion the ""face'' to me is still just a land form. Just because it looks as if it is something could not just be made out of a human face. If they had more evidence then it would be believeable but until then my opnion is still that it is a land form.                   ",2,1,0.8517389893531799
c29152d,"A lot of scientists think that the Face was created by aliens. I know that it is just a natural landform. They have no evidence that there is aliens on Mars but they say aliens made the Face.

First, I feel this is just a natural landform because why would aliens just attempt to make a human face. They have no reason to because they don' t know what we look like. Even if there is aliens then they wouldn't make a face of human's for no reason. The passage states that they made an emourmous head, but why would they make a sculpture of a head and not the whole body. If the alien's actually knew what we look like then why would they only make a head.

Next, honestly the pictures that these people got overtime doesn't even look like a human face. It looks like a bird that has just fading away. Speaking real it's just a natural landform. It could be a crater or the wind just chipped away at it. It would be cool if the aliens made the sculpture but none of those people have clear evidence or proof that alien's made this.

Lastly, on the high definition picture it could be a reflection of some kind because the place where the eyes are supposed to be it is black. Also, on the right side it looks like they cut it off because that is not easy to see. The right side looks like a straight line. So, erosion could have eroded the right side off of the natural landform. The picture shows that there is craters beside ""the Face"" this is a big clue to me that the lanform is natural.

To examplify, this would be practically impossible to say because they are assuming that alien's did this when it could honestly be anything. It would make most sense to be a natural landform because even on Earth there are natural landforms that look like objects or animals. This is why i think it's a natural landform.

I am saying natural landform because alians aren't real, and if they were why would they create a human face. Maybe they were tryin to send a sign, if they were trying to send a sign why couldn't they have just come to earth and tell us what we need to know.

The is a 50/50 chance that it could be your imagination, just like if you were staring out of space or looking up at the ceiling and see a random shape or face, that is your imagination, so it could be you imagination. But the scientist wasn't really focused on this ""face"" they just happened to look over an see it otherwise just like if it was your imagination you would be very focused on to something and happen to see it.

I think that because there is nothing out there in the space that would make a random planet looks like it has a face.

According to the article,""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.' "" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,1) Just because it looks like a human face with human creatures, doesn't mean we should come up with a conclusion.

Next, it is true that the Face looks like a human's face, but there is no prove yet. It might be other rocks in space that caused the face. If you think the Face was created by aliens, you will first need a prove of aliens existance. First, we don't know if aliens really exist. If we don't know about existance of aliens, that would make it harder for people to believe the Face was created by aliens. Also, it says over the year, the Face gets sharper.

They should also learn more about the natural landforms of the space to know more about what could create a mysterious face on Mars. I think we should think or look more further into the article for the conclusion to imerge.

In a conclusion, I think the Face isn't created by the aliens. Even the article says it was not an alien who did this. The article states, ""There was no alien monument after all."" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,1) If you think the Face was created by aliens, you should look further into it, to make your statement come true. For all these reasons, I strongly believed that the Face wasn't created by an alien.",3,1,0.890433669090271
c3058fe,"The Face on Mars

By jimmy

NASA`s had send a spacecraft called Viking 1. Many of the people that were working on this were think it was something else. When it came out 1976 many peolpe think it was made by aliens. But on one know that it was. So it be came an icon for the plant mars. Many people think it was aliens that made the face or hills that from the face on mars. 22 years later Mars Global surveyor had a spacecaft that was going aronud mars to the face but when they did they take the image. Many were happy to see other image. But it did not came a clear as they what it to be. But what i think it could be is that a rock may crash into mars and made the face. But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill. What are the black spot in the photograph that we see here. It could be that is that can be made on mars by wnich it from by.

c31ef3b,"Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa. It is a natural landform just like it would be on our home planet of Earth. Although some conspiracy theorists say differently, and think that is some sort of ancient civilization building these objects.

First off, the cameras that we have today are more advanced than the ones we had. The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says that, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

Another thing is that, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist from NASA's Mars Exploration Program, compared the Martian mesa to natural landforms that occur here on Earth. In paragraph 12, Garvin said, "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars."" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars.

In contrast, conspiracy theorists say that there is a face on Mars and that there is ancient civilization on Mars. In paragraph 8, it says that, "" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings we hidden by haze."" Conspiracy theorists also state that NASA would rather hide the evidence that there is an ancient civilization on Mars, as it says in paragraph 5. Also stated in paragraph 5, is that the defenders of NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

The face has been a pop icon ever since the discovery of the formation. the face will always be a piece of history and will always been known to man. If there was an actual face on Mars then that would be a sign of life. The face ended up eing a mesa and nothing else besides that. Although it would have been an exciting discovery for NASA, we still have much more of space that is unknown and unexplored. NASA is bound to find some kind of incredible object. We will have to wait until that day comes and find something incredible and will be part of the incredible true story of space.                             ",5,1,0.8690336346626282
c3363a9,"If people look at images of Cydonia Mars, they will come to see what looks like a mysterious face. A plethora amount of people belive that this face was made by aliens. Aliens are not real, and if they where we would have come to account with them by this day in age. It is humorous to think that people belive in aliens. These claims are rediculous to even think about if you have common sence.

The mysterious face on Mars is just a mesa. It is just something that came to be like how the Grand Canyon was formed. As the cameras get better pictures, the face starts to disappear. The picture was took in 1976 when technology was just now new to us. The conspiracy theory is not true.

People claim that then new picture of the face is not a valid source because it was ""cloudy."" These claims are rediculous. We went up into space again to find that it still looked nothing like a face. If this was created by aliens, then that means the pyramids were created by aliens, or Niagara Falls was created by aliens. It is the same as saying the universe was created by aliens.

The face is just a natural landform just like any natural landform on Earth. If the face was supposidly created by aliens then you could also say that about any natural landform on Earth. In fact, the new pictures of the face look nothing like a face.

People who believe these theories must have a huge imagination. If these aliens are real, how come we havent come to account with them yet. Many people believe that the face was made by aliens. The mysterious face on Mars is was not created by aliens.",3,1,0.8870527744293213
c382fe5,"In the article Unmasking the Face on Mars the face is just a natural landform. The reason this is is because there has been things found like this before. Another is that there is no solid proof that the landform was made by aliens. A third reason is that the people that got the rumor started about all of this are conspiracy theorists.

There has been things like this found in space before. In the article the author states that the sensation of finding the landform was short lived because scientists figured it was just another mesa. Since the scientist said another that means there has been things like this found before. If there has been others found before why is this one so special. The scientist state that they were not actually consstructed there.

Besides that there is actually no solid proof that this landform was made by aliens. That is just an opinion. The fact that it looks lika face is the only reason people believed that the landform was made by aliens. Nobody has ever actually been on mars to investigate this landform and prove that it was made by aliens. The only things we have of it are just pictures. So that means that there is no solid proof that the landform was alien made.

The people that came up with the rumor are conspiracy theorists. That means that the thought of this landform being alien made is just a conspiracy theory. A conspiracy theory is just a buch of bits and pieces of infromation that the theorist put together and think is suppost to mean something. These bits and pieces of infromation are put together even if they didn't happen in chronological order. That means that all a conspiracy theory is is an edjucated guess. Once again that also means there if no solid proof about it.

All three of those reasons go along with the fact that the face looking landform in space is not alien made. All of the rumor about this landform beging alien made are just guesses and theories. With that being said I hope that now people will stop believing everything that people say about this subject unless they have solid proof that what they are saying is true.",4,1,0.8647454977035522

When the news got to the public they emediatly jumped to the conclution that it was an alian artifact. I can reasure you that it is nothing more than a natural landform that looks like a face.

When NASA went back to retake pictures on April 5,1998, it showed that there was nothing at all but a nautral landform. The public still were not agreeing on it just being a landform due to them taking the pictures on a cloudy winter day. So the NASA team took pictures yet again on April 8, 2001. This time a cloudless summer day.

Garvin, a NASA worker, says,""If there were objects in this picture like airplains on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The 2001 pictures showed the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""

Another reason may be just getting out of the house and exploring. You don't just have to stay in one area on mars you can go anywhere. Let me start by saying it would be an excellent experience for both kids and adults.

It was in Hollywood films, in grocery stores, on the radio,also in books and magiziens. You cant believe every thing you watch in movies or online. Two thirds of Hollywoods movies are based on things they know that people wpuld watch. People can put anything in a newspaper or say it on the radio and people would think it was the truth. But you will need research and evidence to make sure what you watch or hear is true. You can also go to the gricey store and hang up any type of posters and make someone believe that what that poster say is the truth.

The face on mars was really a natuarl rock that was shaped like a face. it was discovered on April 5, 1998 when they took better photos.

Aliens arn't the reason the Face is on Mars. Nasa has went on three missions to Mars to take pictures. Each time they went there has been no trace of aliens. Also NASA upgraded their camaras each time they went to Mars. So the pictures were more clearer.

On the second mission NASA went on, the camaras proved it was a natural landform. Though other scientist belived alien markings were being hidden by wispy clouds. This is because it was winter in Mars during the time NASA went. Still NASA went on a third trip to make its point. This time they used their most advanced camera yet and took crystal clear pictures of the Face.

The pictures reaveled it was a Martian equivalent of a butte. This is a common landform around the American West. This couldn't be caused by aliens because Mars could've caused this landform to appear. Just like in the American West. Still people think that the alien markings are still there.

Overall aliens could'nt of caused this landform. There is no evidence of aliens being on Mars. There is only fiction stories about it, and on radio talk shows. NASA has went on three missions to prove it's a natural landform, and they were'nt able to find alien markings.

Both are possible, but only one is probable. The media can lead you to believe information that might not be true. Like in this situation, the ""Face on Mars"" that is said to be bona fide evidence of alien life, but it is proven to be just a natural landform.

Forty years ago, when the ""face"" was first revealed, it seemed very likely that it was not made by nature. The search for alien life and all the money put into NASA's programs made people believe what they wanted to hear. As time went on, and new technology was put into effect, the images of the mesa became clearer. In the early 2000's, it was made clear that the mysterious ""face"" was just an illusion. One can tell from the images of the ""Face on Mars"" that the mesa can appear to look like a face when out of focus. Alien life on Mars has not been proven either, so without evidence of life, we can't assume that the ""face"" was not created by nature.

It is possible that the mesa appeared as a face because of the dept perception and shadows. In reality, the landform barely looks like a face at all. In the most recent photo, the small details on the mesa almost look like the rivers we have here on Earth. The mesa is even compared to landforms that are found on Earth, as stated in the article. Since there is no proof of the ""face"" being alien-made, the only conclusion left is that it is a natural landform.",3,1,0.8644647002220154
c45ff55,"The ""face"" on Mars is indeed a natural landform. The ""face"" could have been formed by multiple things. Such as being hit by other rocks, or it may even be the formation of some kind of sand. A lava dome could be another option of what it is. The picture is sharp enough to catch any living evidence. The article states, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times biggerthan the pixel size,"" (NASA, 12). What they are stating here is that if some kind of living evidence was in the picture they would be able to recognize it instantly.

A so called ""face"" formation on mars, even showed up as a natural landform. as stated in the text,

""a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (NASA, 7). What they are stating in that paragraph is that it may have looked like a alien monument but it was never a ""alien monument"", it was just a natural landform. That which could have been made by many different occasions that may have happen. Scientist are always searching for more and more explanations everyday.

If there was any objects in the first picture taken, any sciencetist or any citizen could have noticed the picture was sharp enough to pinpoint any living evidence or so called ""aliens"". Even if there was transportation such as cars airplanes or any shelter as known as ""Egyptian-Style Pyramids"" or even ""Small Shacks"", you would have been able to make out an tell what the objects are. As started from the text ""unmasking the face on mars"", ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were"" (NASA, 12)!

The so called ""face"" on the planet ""Cydonia"" could have been formed by lava and may even be a ""lava dome"". Yeah some people qont always agree with the evidence, but you have to look at the facts. You also might not agree there is lava on the planet Cydonia but honestly tell me have you ever been to Cydonia to prove to me 100%, aliens made the monument and its not a natural landform? once you show me that proof ill take another look and maybe turn my point of veiw from your side.

NASA can compare the so called ""face on the red planet"" to many different things on earth. They can compare height, shape, color, texture, etc. as stated in ""unmasking the face on mars"", ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars""(NASA, 12) In that evidence from the text they are saying they can take the height and compare it to the Face on Mars and it will be almost exactly the same. I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform, not every person in the world may agree but if you look at the facts and evidence together you will be able to comprehend the ""Face"" is not an aliens monument, it is a natural landform.",4,1,0.918419599533081

Now, this may be hard to agree with, but the Face is actualy a structure similar to a butte or a mesa, a semi-flat landform common in the American west. It should also be noted that the area around Cydonia (a region on Mars on which the Face is located on,) is extremely cloudy around the time the pictures were taken by the Viking 1 in 1976. Also, Cydonia has many other mesa-like structures that are quite common in the area. The manner in which the Face was formed is unknown, but many scientists belive that shadows formed from outcrops in the area created the illusion of the eyes, the nose, and the mouth on the structure, giving it it's facelike apperence. There were three diffrent gruops of photographs taken of this structure. The first was taken by the aformentioned Viking 1, in 1976. The second was taken on April First, 1998, by The Mars Global Surveyer. The last one was taken in April of 2001, again by the Mars Global Surveyer. If this was a face, would'nt all three pictures be the same, insted of the last two being clear eveidence that the Face isen't a face at all, but rather a naturaly forming landmass?

I cannot make a conclusion and say that cloud is a bunny and think that one day a bunny was in the cloud and it's face started to form. It is based on your perspective.

Although both answer could be true, the reasonable one is the fact that the Face of Mars is just a landform.

In 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a picture of what is called the Face of Mars. According to the text, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Later on in the text it is stated that, ""When the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"".

The scientific world has taken a big step toward technology and this new science has given scientists more information toward the solar system that were unknown before.

Nevertheless, after this research people were still not satiesfied with the fact that the Face of Mars is just a landform. They believed that the picture was not taken at the right place.

Scientists were determied to prove them wrong. So, they engage into a new study. It is stated that on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Suveyor took another look to the planet Mars. According to the text, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the Field of view,"" said Garvin.

Later on in the texts, it is explain that what came out of the picture was just a landform like the ones we can find on Earth. For instance, the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

c54f667,"The first time NASA first spotted the Face on Mars was in 1976 during the Viking 1 mission. At first the scientists back at NASA were surprised, but it did not last long. After some research was done scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. What made the mesa look like a face were just shadows. When the image was revealed to the public it got a lot of attention. Although some believed the face was a sign of alien life, others were not as easily convinced.

The first picture was taken in 1976 when technology was not very great. So in 1997

NASA 's Mars Exploration Program chief scientist, Jim Garvin decided he'd try to get another photo. On April 8, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the site again. Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture that was, ""Ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,"" the article says. But other conspiricy theorists think otherwise.

The article mentions that the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. It was apparently winter there in April of '98. Skeptics say, ""Perhaps alien markings were hidden by the haze."" Garvin says, ""Targeting Cydonia was not easy...in fact it is hard to work."" Mars Global Surveyor noramally looks straight down but in order to get a good picture, they would have to actually move the camera 2.5 km. They also do not pass over the face very often.

On April 8, 2001 they attempted another picture. This time the picture was perfect. It was a cloudless day in Cyndonia. ""The team had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view."" Garvin said. Not easy work. The article also mentions that each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photos. I think that this picture did really prove that the Face was only a landform and not some kind of martian marking.

In the end people came to relize that the Face on Mars was really on a butte or a mesa of some sort. Garvin says, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground...you could have seen what they were."" I personally do not think the Face is part of ancient Martian life but as Garvin says, ""It reminds me of most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho."" I hope now that the others that once believed in the face now relize it really was only their imagination.          ",3,1,0.7931632995605469
c589dc1,"Was there life on Mars? Around 25 years ago, NASA's spacecraft named, Viking 1, was in search for the sister ship, Viking 2. While searching, they spotted on Mars, something in the form of a human face! Could it be signs of Aliens on Mars? It seemed to be looking at

a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Among the mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab, there must have a number of people shocked to see face on their moniters. It was sensational while it lasted. Scientes firgured it to be another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.

NASA decided to show the rest of the world what they had seen. The caption read as, "" huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It was reasoned out to be a good to get attention to Mars. It actually worked! Since then that face became a pop icon showing up in flims, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines!

Many people came to the conclusion that there was life on Mars. Well, they were wrong. Scientists keep trying to figure it out. Soon it came to a dead end. The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin.

It also shows that a human could have did it because there had been a Martian mesa here on this plant before,""But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa"".

Also people have vist the plant so in some type of way they could have wanted to mark there spot on the plant. It could also be a possibility that it was not a human or an alien that has put this face on the plant it could have been there before anyone have even visit this plant. And after they snapped pictures ten times and it still came back that a alien didn't do the face on the plant.

But they still didn't find out who it could have been that left it there. BUt in the picture it shows a butte or an mesa,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butta or mesa-- landforms common around the American West.",3,1,0.8342059850692749

NASA used all there research and what they know to figure out what this was. Some people think that it was just an illusion created by shadows giving it eyes, nose, and a mouth. It reminds some people of landforms like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho or any landform they think that comes close with it. It could've just been a metreo that hit Mars and formed it. I think it was just a natural landform.

We may never know what it truly is. There have been many weird things in space that we could never figure out. Some of those things are just normal stuff that happens in space and some people don't know that happens. It could've just been a normal thing that happen and everyone thinks it's a big piece of information of aliens.

People make hypothesis way to quickly based off of what they've seen and heard. Not all things are true. No one has truly seen an alien before and if there were aliens shouldn't have people already have seen one?

c5f6c71,"The 'Face' on Mars is made naturally. In 1976 we did not have

the technology that we have today.

The picture then was only a fraction of pixels that we have now. This allowed us to see the picture much more clearer. We saw that this was just a Mesa which is a lava dome. Mesa are very common in the Cydonia area side of Mars which this is located.

Plus why would N.A.S.A hide this from the public. N.A.S.A now needs funds that would benefits from this. A surplus amount of money would come in if N.A.S.A would have told the public that this was indded a alien monument to something and or that this was once life on cousin Mars. People would want to hear more, learn more about this. This would indeed reboost a Space program that was once on top of the economics stcuture in there respected work.

On April 5th in 1998 the Mars Orbiter Camera by Michael Malin took a picture that they posted on a JBL website. Many people where waiting to see what would have become of the higher solution picture of the 'Face'. Many where dissapointed when they found out it was just an natural landform.

Then on April 8th N.A,S.A checked the face again. Many conspiresters where ranting that there was indeed

alien markings on the 'Face'. So N.A.S.A went to the now known Mesa. They checked every square visble inch on it and still found no sign of alien life.

They said that this is very simalar to the states Middle Buttles located in Snakes River Plain in Idaho. So do you now still believe there is something out there that built a Mesa?       ",3,1,0.8318058848381042
c61d32d,"The face, is it martian made or a natural landform? The face is not a alien artifact it is a land form that is formed with facial features like eyes and a nose. The Viking 1 captured a mesa land formation that resembled a face not a martian made artifact. In 1998 a MOC team captured a picture that proved the ""Face"" was a mesa land form. Then agian in 2001 another team captured a picture of the mesa with a Mars Global Surveyor agian NASA came to the conclusion it was a mesa.

In 1976 a Viking 1 camera captured a bone chilling picture of what looks like a face. As scientists studyed the picture they came to the conclusion that it was an oddly formed mesa that resembled a human face. After they let the picture out to the public the popularity of this mesa sky rocketed it haunted the world for twenty five years before NASA did another expadition to prove it was a mesa.

In 1998 a GOC team captured a picture of this so called face. After further exsamination NASA found the face to be a land form commonly known as a mesa. After studying the mesa the group of scientists compaired the face to mesas in Cydonia, the area the face was found, they came to the conclusion the face was really a mesa that had a peculiar formation.

Then agian in 2001 skeptics lead NASA to do another expadition to capture another picture of the phonomanon. After finding the same evidince as they had the past two times NASA ruled it a mesa. Skeptics had no way of saying the face was anything but a mesa. NASA had proven it three times there was no denying it, the face was a land formation that was rather common were the pictures were taken.

Now NASA could be wrong the pictures could have been edited to contain the secret that there was life on mars. NASA could have tampered with the photographs to mislead the public. But life on mars would be good for NASA, the fact that we are not alone would get NASA the funding to start all kinds of expaditions that would help the United States in the Space race to mars. If there was life on mars NASA would have trillions of dollars to fund there research on the planet. This proves that NASA's findings were correct that the face is a mesa that looks oddly like a human face.

After reading this you should realise the face is nothing more than a mesa land formation that was blown out of preportion. The media took a simple fact and turned it into a alien artifact this concludes the fact that the face was a naturally formed mesa nothing less nothing more. The face is a mesa that looks strangly like a human face that became a pop icon for twenty five years.",4,1,0.8470826148986816
c61d606,"Some people may think that the Face was created by aliens, but it was not. The face is just a natural landform that is a huge rock formation. No aliens were involved in the making of it. Although it has starred in books, films, magazines and talk shows that does not mean it was created by aliens.

To start from the beginning, NASA was just circling Mars taking pictures of possible places where one of the other ships could land. Then it spotted the shadowy rock that looked like a face. A few days after NASA snapped the photo of the Face everyone was engaged in it.

Anyways, the photo that NASA snapped of the Face was not created by aliens. If it was NASA would be looking for any form of life on my Mars instead of just calling it a natural landform.

It was just a landform that was created naturally like the ones on Earth.

In conclusion, I would like to say there is no actual evidence that aliens created the landform or that they exist. The Face was not created by aliens and is just made out of rock that happened to form into the shape of a face and as time goes on it looks less like a face.",2,1,0.8980239629745483
c62bbd0,"Yes, the idea of the face being a creation of intellectual life, outside of our planet, is certainly quite intriguing. However, the idea isn't entirely ethical, and I do not agree with the theory that it is a product of martian life. However ""uncanny"" the face is, and aidmittedly, it is quite detailed, so I could see how one would think that it was constructed by intellegent life forms, but it just isnt logical.

We have yet to recieve any other signs of current life on mars, and why would this be the way of reaching out? As far as we have found (although, i would love for this to be incorrect) there is currently no life on mars, intellectual or otherwise, and with no one around to construct it, obviously all fingers point twards it being a natural land form.

There are many other examples of images, resembeling human faces showing up throughout space (although the ""face on mars"" is quite detailed compaired to some of the others). one common example would be the ""man in the moon"", which was likley formed by either asteroids, or other natural happenings that occur on the moon. Obviously the face on mars, is not the product of an asteroid impacting the surface of the planet, because an asteroid would imprint, but the face is raised, but it does show that sometime things that look human, are simply a product, caused by nature.

The first picture ever captured of the face, was taken in 1976, by the ship ""Viking 1"" as we all know the technology (cameras, and photo quality included) wasn't the best, and the article tells us that the resoloution was limited, it says ""43 meters per pixel in the best 76' Viking photo"". That was when the theory of the face was most avid, and it could very well ahve been partially due to the limited resoloution and quality of the photo. however in the 2001 photos of the face, which were used to conclude that it was simply a mesa, and not an alien artifact, the quality is much higher, which would obviously enable them to reach a far more sound conclusion, than any based off of the 76' photos.

Like I said, the idea that the face could be an alien artifact, is entirely unfounded. The idea that NASA would cover up a discovery like this

is entirely lewdacris, because a discovery of this nature is not only pretty much the entire point of th eprogram, but it would aso attract more attention, and taxdollars.",3,1,0.7764071226119995

There is no true face on mars' surface,it is merely a lava dome that takes on the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same elevation as the surface of this red planet.

Nothing more than a huge rock formation that resembles a human face, in the sense that there are irregular shadows that create the odd look of eyes, a mouth, and a nose.This illusion may have made its way to movies, magazines.etc... But just because they mention the name of a planet

that does not make what they say scientificly backed up.

We have already photographed the surface of this grand land structure, and yet it has proved to be nothing more than I have just stated.

c6ec467,"The Face of Mars

What if the Face on Mars was actually created by aliens? How would have the world reacted? Well we wouldn't know. The face on mars is actually a mesa that happens to be shaped like a face. We know that the face on mars was not created by aliens because there are no signs of life, as far as NASA knows there is no life on mars, the Face of mars is just a mesa, but if the Face was created by aliens we would be able to see symbols and signs but all you can see are just small vallys and ridges. Aliens did not build the face on mars.

As far as we know there is no visible life on mars. The reason for this is because mars is inhabitable. The conditions are mars are to harsh for any living organism to be able to live. There have been many expiditons by rovers that have roamed the red planet for years and still have not seen any forms of life. The author states, ""There was no alien monument after all."" With all this it would be almost impossible for a life form to be able to live on Mars.

Eventhough there is no visible life on Mars there has never been a sign of life ever being on Mars. Again with all the probes and missions to Mars there has never been a one-hundred percent fact that there has been life on Mars. The Mars rovers have taken over 100 samples and still have found no signs of life ever being on the planet. When the author quotes Jim Garvin, We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. The reason for this is because the planet has no life on it and if the only exciting thing that the scientists at nasa could find was just a mesa that looks like a face.

All in all this is not a creation made by aliens it is a mesa on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has released facts about why this wonder of mars is just a normal natural landform. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin."", the author also gives us this peice of information, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" With this all being said with the high resoloution picture and the quote from the scientist at NASA you can say for sure the Face is a natural land form.

Although some people might say this is not a natural land form. They might say that it is a alien artifact left by some martians or some garbage like that. Some people dont under stand that crazy land forms canjus occur naturaly. The author gives the reader a wonderful example of this on our own planet, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. So if we on earth believe that the mesas in the American West can be made by the earth doing what it does why cant Mars make its own land forms.

The face of mars is just a natural land form in one of Mars's mesas. There are no signs of life on mars, There have never been any signs of life on mars, and the Face of mars is just a cool looking formation made by a mesa biome. So what will you be doing accepting that the Face of Mars or looking to every little nook and cranny of the web of lies called the internet to find out what the real truth is about the Face of Mars.",5,1,0.8237246870994568

For this argument, I come up with three reasons for that. My first reason is, how can the unmasking face can be natural landform?The answer is, it was created by

an aliens.""How do you know?"" Even other scientist said

that the unmasking face was natural landform I still think it's from the an alien. My secod reason is, the unmasking face look like a human face so the point is the aliens might look like human,us. We don't know if it is a natural landform or not. So, it can be but the only reason for that is, it was created by aliens. My last reson about the unmasking face is, natural landform can be but there's no provement for that .

In conclusion, I wanted to tell you that

the ""Unmasking the Fcae on Mars"" is created by an aliens. Why? because that's the only way there's an unmasking face. I'm positive that the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" was created by an aliens.",1,1,0.777350664138794
c74a14f,"So you say the discovery of the face Cydonia that was founded in Mars back in 1976 was created by aliens. I seem to disagree with your argument. As we have done more research here in NASA back in 2001 each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 image which means with the new and more improved technology we got a closer and better resolution of the face Cydonia on Mars which you so think was created by aliens. The recent image of Cydonia from 2001 has better pixel quality so that we can zoom in more to see if there are any other objects other than Cydonia such as cars or houses in which we both know don't exist in the red planet. Cydonia has unusual shadows that make it resemble a human head with it giving us an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalent of a butte Mesa which are also landforms that are commonly found in the American West. So as you know that after the discovery, photographing Cydonia has became one of our main priority for us here at NASA to prove that it wasn't created by aliens. I hope that after you heard my side of the argument you have a different view of Cydonia as it formed by itself in the red planet.",3,1,0.8313899040222168
c7c591e,"In 1976, a NASA Mars Globe surveyor called Viking 1 took a picture of an area on Mars that looked like a face. Although some believe the Face was created by aliens, I believe it is a natural landform because the pictures provide visual evidence, it would prove there is life on other planets, and it would bring in money for NASA.

NASA has taken 3 pictures. The first one taken in 1976 looked most like a face, but NASA said that it was the planet's ""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" A second picture was taken on April 5, 1998 that was ten times sharper than the original picture taken by Viking 1. Web surfers were dissapointed to see a natural landform. The unsatisfied viewers claimed that the whispy clouds hid the alien markings on the Face. April 8, 2001, on a cloudless summer day, they took a picture with each pixel spanning 1.56 meters compared to the previous 43 meters per pixel. The new picture revealed exactly what NASA claimed the Face to be, a mesa.

The discovery of life outside of Earth would be exciting. It would provide a chance to exchange scientific knowlege and possibly food or animals. It could also reveal new technologies that could put the world years further than it would be without this help. This excange could change both planets for the better and improve the lives of all species. NASA wouldn't pass up this chance to better the planet.

Some conspiracy theorists may claim, ""The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA wold rather hide."" This is untrue because the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization because it would bring in more money. This could be spent on new technology that could lead to new discoverys in space.

This proves that the Face on Mars was not caused by aliens. It is a natural landform that is claimed to look like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is about the same height as the Face on Mars. If an alien civilazation were discovered, though, we would not pass up the opportunity to change both our world and the aliens' world for the better. ",4,1,0.840589165687561
c7f6c0e,"In 1976, the Viking 1 took a photo of what seemed to be a face on mars. It looked like it had eyes, a mouth, and a nose, but really, it didn't have those features. It was a just natural landform. It was not created by aliens.

It is, in fact, a mesa, or butte, like on earth. It is a platform of naturally formed rock on the surface of mars. The shadows on the mesa make it look kind of like a face, when it is actually just a natural formation. The picture showed the differet cracks and dips in the formaton that made the shadows on the mesa. In America, there are lots of different mesas, such as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

It may look like a face on Mars, but that is ecaue of the Viking 1 didn't have the most accurate cameras. The pictures were taken more than 35 years ago. They didn't have cameras as advanced as we do. The Viking 1 took those pictures in 1976. Each pixel spanned 43 meters. That is not a very defined picture. In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took some pictures of the ""face"" with a more advanced camera at its highest resolution. Each pixel only spanned 1.56 meters. That means that its a very accurate picture. It showed how the ""face"" was actually a mesa.

There are always possibilities of alien life having to do with the formation, but that is a very very slim chance. Conspiracy theorists are not necessarily profesionals. NASA scientists can easily see how the face is just a formation. They would probably be really glad if the formation was made by extraterrestrials, but they know that it wasn't made by aliens.

In conclusion, the ""face on Mars"" is just a land formation called a mesa. Scientists have taken more recent pictures with the Mars Global Surveyor to prove that it is a land formation.

c83d850,"""Is this a face created by aliens or a landform"" many wonder. This specific picture of a so called ""face"" on Mars has captured the eyes of many. The picture that NASA has showen or released to us resembles a face like landform on Mars in 1976, but in the picture that was taken in 2001 clearly shows it was just a landform. Many people thought that there was possible life on Mars, but they are yet to discover if there really is. Many landforms like this so called ""face"" are found in the American West.

This ""face"" is just another theory that there is life on Mars.

Many people want to believe that there is life on Mars, so when the Vicking took the photo it just made them think that there was a greater chance of life on Mars.

There has been many thoughts on if this picture could really be a face or just a landform, but with improved technology NASA discovered that this ""face"" had occured naturally, not created by aliens. A face that was created by aliens wouldn't stick out as far as this natural landform, nor would it have stayed on Mars for over 30 years. Landfroms usually occur naturally, so who knows how long this ""face'' could have been there when there were photographs taken of it , but then again it could have just popped up the day that Vicking landed there.

In 2001 they went back to see if this was an actual face or just a landform and with the higher quality cameras they could simply zoom in, which they did, and see that this was just a naturally occuring landform that formed over time. Naturally occuring lanforms happen over periods of time and that is simply what happened on Mars, it just happened to look a lot like a face.

In conclusion, this ''face'' is just a natural landform that formed over the years. There has yet to be life discovered on Mars, just landforms that have shapes of faces. Aliens did not create this face, nor was there an actual face in the Mars surface. There should be more pictures taken of this ''face'' so that it will prove that it occured naturally. Therefore, there are no faces or life on Mars surface.",3,1,0.9187074899673462

If you look at the face in the pictures they all look like huge landforms with a face. Most of those pictures with a face shows the eyes, nose, and mouth all look darker than the face itself. Other scientist here proved that the eyes, nose, and mouths on these landforms are shadows. ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.'""

All the pictures of a landform that had a face, the eyes, nose, and mouth were just shadows showing an illusion of a face. So now the mystery of the faces on Cydonia are solved and they are just illusions that look like a human head.",2,1,0.8345222473144531

If you look at the first photo it does kinda look like a face, but as the years go by there are better cameras and the ""face"" don't really seem like a face any more. In the worse case, this could just be the scariest landform ever. In paragraph 10 it explains ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans a.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo,"" this would mena that the camera used in 2001 was better than the one used in 1976. The photo in the 2001 photo looks like a lump in the ground.

In paragraph 12 Garvin states ""It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River of Idaho,"" this wouldmake sense because it would be a landform. It might just be a little likely for it to look like a face. In paragraph 7 is clearly states ""there was no alien monument after all.""Landforms are just sometimes diferent and this is one of them.

Maybe shadows are just to blame. In paragraph 3 it said "" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion od eyes, nose, and mouth,"" this would mean that maybe it was the angle the photo was taken or the time of day.The moon could've just been turned right to make it look like eyes a nose and a mouth.It was all just an illusion.

I believe that the ""face"" on the moon was just a landform and nothing else. I believe that there are always answers. i believe that it is just a landform, or the cameras fault, or it's the shadows to blame.        ",3,1,0.8556463718414307
c8948b3,"Brock was walking in the woods along the creek. At the edge of the water, he saw something that made a body type figure. Brock went down to see if it was a body, but when he got down there, it was really hard to see if it was a body because of the running water. He went back up to where he saw the body, and he coud see it clearly again. He took a picture of the body figure and sent it to the Elkart County Lab. They went to take a look at it and they posted the picture sent from Brock online. Most of the people who saw it, including some of the scientist, thought it was some sort of alien figure. They dug it out and found it to be a rock formed into a body shape by the shadows of the water, and the erosion that has been done to the rock. I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it isn't an alien formation, you can see what it is made of, and there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real.

One example that proves my claim is that the author explains in the excerpt that it isn't an alien formation. The author states that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed that it was just a natural landform, not an alien monument. The author also states that it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Another example that demonstrates my claim is that according to the author, you can see what it is made of. The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Garvin said, ""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airplaines on the ground, or Egytian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

A final example that proves my claim is that the author demonstrates that there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real. The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.

This landmark had something special to it,this land mark has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. If it was an Egyptian Pharaoh the Egyptians would have had to have access to a type of modern tecology to get up to Mars. Not only that but they wouldn't know how to store or make food last in space. The journey up to Mars is a long one. “So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!” If we had saw these type of things then maybe we would need to look further into it, however we didn't so we have no proof that they lived on Mars long enough to build this ""special mound"" or ""Egyptian Pharaoh "". What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa—landforms common around the American West. “It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

c8b339f,"In 1976, Viking 1 took a picture of what looked to be a a human face on Mars. A few days later the picture was reviealed to the public eye, and it was starred in hollywood film movies, books, magazines, and talks shows. But in 2001, new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it was only a mesa. Though there are many credible reasons to believe that it was only a mesa, some people still believe that is an alien artifact.

Yes, one might think that the mesa looks like a face from an egyptian Pharoh, but after closer examination, it was only a natural landform. We are able to prove this because on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Sureyor flew over for the first time, a picture was taken that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that showed only a natural landform. When the picture was unveiled to the public eye, it had a caption that told people it was a mesa that resembled a human face only because shadows that were on the rock gave an opticl illusion of eye,nose, and mouth. Also on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enogh for a second look and used the cameras absolute maximum resolution to take an even better picture that again showed that it was only a mesa. From these pictures alone you can tell that there wasn't a face on Mars and that there isn't any extraterrestial beings living on Mars.

in conclusion, the ""face"" on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform that you can probably see on Earth. Also if there were to actually be life on Mars, it would be a major break through that would help better fund NASA, so what would be the piont in trying to hide it from the public that funds our research? There would be no piont in doing so which means that there isn't any life on Mars and the face is only a mesa or butte.",3,1,0.7942430377006531
c8b7e84,"Was the Face on Mars really created by Aliens? Or was it just a very unusual rock formation, even for Mars? Well, the answer is no, it was just a natural landform. This giant rock formation, which stretches for about two miles from end to end, isn't uncommon at all. Actually, it is a mesa which just has shadows that cast on it a certain way, which makes it look exactly like a face.

I know what you might be thinking. How could it only be a natural landform? It looks exactly like a face, so it must have been created by something or someone. Well, there are actually plenty of reasons why it is just a normal landform with unusual shadows. For example, the Face was found in an area of Mars called Cydonia. Cydonia is actually known for its common Martian Mesas. This means that it isn't too shocking that it is natural.

Don't get me wrong, a face is a pretty rare and unusual thing for a mesa to look like. Even though this one has strange shadows that give it features of a face, it is still just a mesa. After multiple pictures that were taken of the Face, the one taken on April 5, 1998 was the first one to fully reveal that the Face was indeed just a natural landform. Even though the picture clearly showed that the Face wasn't a man-made structure, some people still weren't convinced. They said that the picture was taken on a cloudy winter day, so many skeptics thought that maybe there were alien markings that were just hidden by haze.

No matter what people believed after they saw the picture taken in 1998, the picture taken on April 8, 2001 was the one that proved to the skeptics that the Face was a naturally occurring landform. Since the picture was taken on a cloudless day the next time around, there were no excuses for those who thought the Face was made by aliens. This picture actually showed that the Face was a martian, and it was about the same size as a butte or a mesa. Buttes and mesas are landforms that are commonly found in the western regions of the United States.

There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end. ",5,1,0.8838148713111877

No way that is most definetly a alien face. So we head back and I told him i'm going to prove you wrong partner. He saids, alight we'll see about that.""

However, many years later, the Face turned out to be a natural formation, like a mesa is on Earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This proves that the Face is not an alien artifact. Also, NASA has found no other evidence of alien life on Mars, so the chances that the Face is made by aliens go down even more. Some people still believe that this Face has something do to with aliens. Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding evidence from us, and that they don't want us to know about aliens on Mars. This theory is also disproved. Jim Garvin said that it's hard work to get photographs of the area, so why would NASA work so hard to get pictures of the Face if they wanted to hide it? Furthermore, NASA would love to find an ancient alien civilization, and would probably share it if they did find something. Finally, there is one more piece of evidence that the Face wasn't made by aliens. There are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face.

But im sure that the scientist opinions are more likly to be true then some reporters opinion. The martian mesa explanation is way more reasonable then it was made by aliens. There are many things to back up that it is just a natural landform. What does anyone have to back up that aliens made it. Nothing supports that.

One thing that supporrts it being a natural landform is that in 1998 MGS flew over cydonia for the first time.

For one why would you believe everything you saw on a movie, tv show, or in a magazine. People right fake stuff all the time to get more views or ratings. People crave things that aren't true.

Nobody that is human has ever lived on mars or even walked on it.

There is not any scientific proof that anything is out in outer space.

I think the ocean and outerspace have a lot in common because, they are like worlds of unknown living things. Hopefully one day someone will be able to explore all of outerspace and give us the real imformation and prove who is right and who is wrong.

Many diffrent things could have causes the rock to form a human like resmeblence,such as a peice of debri hitting the surface of the rock causing indentations. As you can see in the first picture of the face from 1976 there are small feature that resmble eyes and

a nose. As the years progress the pictures look less and less like a human. In the picture from 2001 you can barley tell what the rock is.

In argumentive situation everyone has there own opinions. But with somethings it makes no sense what they're trying to prove. if i was in an argument with someone who thought there was life on the planet Mars i would try to prove how. In space its hard to say theres life in space because scientist have no proof ,no data, or evidence there could be. For there to be a face on mars is hard to believe and for an alien to make it no evidence adds up.

No one really had an exact reaction to the face because all they were assuming there is life on mars. The public started saying theres aliens up there. But the size of the head was two miles and contiued to stare back at everyone. But some people were realistic saying that their was another Martian mesa they were common around cydonia but this image made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So none of the scientist put alot of thought into it but its the people who escalted the theory and image.

The people who thought there was life the rock formation of how it looked gave an illusion of a head, nose, eyes,and a mouth. The public was so dedicated to proving there was and they could prove it. But some other people and scientist were explaining that there is no life. The more people started talking and hearing about it became a bit more fake and hard to believe. This theory of the face started becoming in Hollywood flms, books, magazines and just made up stories.

Nasa begun to get frusterated and there budget started decreasing. Nasa actually wished it was acient civilizationon mars instead. Scientist started blieving that the face was alien artifact. So they started photographing Cydonia as i priority. When they started photographing more and more they were sorta getting somewhere. But they finally sent out Mars Global Surveyors and flew obver to Cydonia and they took a picture. The picture was ten times better and sharper than the original photos they had with the viking.

Nasa tried to get alot more photos and were gettiing no where becuase of the main reason the weather. But on April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia go a perfect view of the face. Soon Nasa made a conclusion the picture actually looked like the Martian Equivalent. A butte or messa they were landforms common around the American West.

Secondly, with the technology we have today our team would've definitely knew something was up the first time we saw it. Honestly, these theories and assumptions that aliens or how other unknown creatures made that face, shows that we are not all on the same page. In certain ways it even shows offense toward NASA by questioning our research.

Finally, if this Face was created by another type of life that we may not know about then we most likely would've known about it by now. Quite frankly I think it's best if we don't ever come face-to-face with those different types of unknown life considering they may be way more advanced than our civilization with more advanced technology and many other things that mankind isn't ready for yet. They may end up being the enemy instead of the friend and that could very much jepordize mankind.

Furthermore, I could go on and on about how this is just another rock on an ever bigger rock, but you will still have your opinions and I will still have my research. I just hope that I have given you a better thought of what this whole fiasco people have caused really is instead of giving them false information. Thank you for reading.

ca49bac,"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars when it spotted what appeared to be a likeness of a human face in a region called Cydonia. Over the years there has been speculation that this ""face"" was created by aliens. But over the years new equiptment has revealed the ""face"" for what it is: a mesa.

There are three key points of evidence that disprove the alien theory: the equiptment first used to photograph the Face on Mars is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the sky was clear on Mars when the 2001 image was taken, and Earth has similar landforms on its surface. For example, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spams 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Technology has advanced much from since 1976 and 2001 image is a clear example. The 2001 image also has another detail that can't be left out: it was taken on a cloudless Martian day. A last piece of evidence sure to disprove the alien theory is the fact that Earth has similar landforms on its surface. The Face on Mars, ""...is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

To conclude, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. The image from 1976 was photographed with equiptment that is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the Martian sky was cloudless when the 2001 image was taken, and the 2001 image proved that the Face on Mars is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, something commonly found on Earth.",3,1,0.8389291763305664

People don't always think that creations like that can be made by a natural landform. If you see in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" they give ecidence showing that the face on mars was actually a natural landform. It states "" A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see . The caption noted a ""huge rock formation ... which resembles a human head,"" The qoute is saying that when they out the image closer it looks like a human head made by rocks ""

""The image first appeared on a JPL website, reavealing ... a natural landform , there was no alien monment after all."" According to the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". This qoute is saying real evidence that there was no alien monument the face on mars was a natural landform.

Although few scientists believe the face was an alien artifact, a scientist named Jim Garvin proved them wrong by saying ""What the picture is actually showing is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms comman around the Amercian West.""

caa6e26,"The logical explination for the face being on the moon is the metiors had to hit the planet Mars and they all had landed together to make a face like object in this planets crust to make it look like this. Well because in this acrticle it says in paragraph 3 it was a huge rocks formation.

Also another logical explination would be it was really hot one day and a big fire had started on a mountin where there was lots of dried out land and a big fire started and when the fire stated there was a big spot and the fire had reached it and then it was it the praticular shape of a face so it stood out onto the earths crust. It also says in paragraph 12 that it is a lava dome .

This big landmark could also be made by a big cannion or mountain that is in a direct shape of a face or just a bunch of trees could be gathered together to have a perfect form or shape of a face. In pargraph 12 it also talks about a plain which is a open area with alot of mountains.

Anways this all has an explinations other than aliens doing it. Also like there could have been a massive sand storm and the wind picked up really heavy and was throwing rocks and blew alot of sand and rocks and it could have created a face like object that you see when you look through a telascope at mars.

From what we have found, its just a landmark, you're a scientist, not a conspirasist. You are just believing what you want to beleive, and what you believe has no scientific evidence.

When the mesa looked most like a face was in 1976, that was over 20 years ago. Technolgy has advance since 1976, I mean look at what we have now compared to back then. The NEWER photos from the NEWER peice of technology, the Mars Global Surveyor, has taken better photos of the mesa. That's right: a mesa.

Even when you get disproved, you try to argue about it, now you're just arguing from a point of ignorance. Gavin said, and i quote, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the sameheight as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, there is no face on Mars, just a mesa. You are arguing from a point of ignorance because anything you can be shot down almost immedently.

cadee56,"Many conspiracy theorists say that The Face On Mars is proof of alien life. Some even say that NASA is trying to hide evidence of aliens. The face is nothing more then an illusion though, caused by shadows. Although technology was not advanced when the first photo was published, more recent pictures have proven that this is nothing more then a crater with shadows, creating eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

In 1976 when the first photo was released people quickly began to theorize that alien life was on Mars, but this is simply not true. The picture was taken in low resolution and was very blurry. The Viking 1 Spacecraft was circling the planet searching for landing sites for The Viking 2, when a landform that resembled an enormous face was spotted. This enormous two mile long ""face"" is nothing more then a mesa.

In 1998 a new picture of the mesa was released, but people were still not satisfied. Since it was winter while the mission was launched there was a thick haze over the Red Planet. Many think that NASA is trying to hide evidence that there IS lifeforms on other planets, but this is not true. We as scientists wish to share information on space with the public, but we will not spread false rumors about alien lifeforms when there are none.

On April 8, 2001 we launched another mission to take a more high-resolution photo. Since it was summer there were no clouds to hide the mesa. Mars Global Surveyor rotated 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view. They then took a photo using the camera at maximum resolution. After all the hype about alien life on Mars since the first photo was released, it was clear to see that the Face was nothing but a mesa.

After years of research and three missions to take photos of Mars, it is clear to see that the Face was no evidence of life on another planet. The Face is very similar to something like on Earth. Although the mesa has not proven there is life beyond Earth we as humans still do not know what is beyond.",4,1,0.862527072429657

Well calm down earthlings, it's just a natural landform.

In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

This was soon to be known as the ""Face on Mars"".

People made a huge deal out of it.

The ""Face on Mars"" appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows.

Some people even say it appeared in haunted grocery store checkouts.

On April 5, 1998, NASA's MGS flew over Cydonia, the siting of the face, to snap more picture to reveal that the Face was just a natural landform and nothing more.

The majority of people accepted this statement, but there was a select few people who say that aliens made the Face.

The Face Theorists weren't satisfied with it being just a landform and tried to find evidence to prove NASA wrong.

The Face Theorists found out that the location and date of the April '98 photo was during a cloudy winter.

Skeptics said that the alien markings were hidden by the haze. Three years later, NASA proved our skeptical theorists wrong again. With advanced technology, the right location, and the right season, NASA got the clear picture of the Face they needed to show that it was just a landform.

NASA even suggests that it may be a butte or mesa.

The face is also not alian made becuase if it was there would be more then just a face to prove that they were there. Also scientists can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size to see if the picture was right and that it's not a face. Also another thing is the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa that are landforms common around the American West.

Another reason it could have looked like a face is the took a picture of the Face on Mars and its located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. Witch means the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Witch could have messed up the picture. The new picture was taken on Nevertheless April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at the face. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Before they got that picture they had to do alot of hard work.

Heres what the did, Mission controllers prepared to look again. they said Its not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, its hard work. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. They just dont pass over the Face very often. The first time they took the pickture it wasnt that good of a picture. This is what happened before they got the good photo. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. It was a better photo then the first one taken by the viking but it had a glare and wasn't as good as the second one.

cb44d67,"What Does it Look Look Like to You

The ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform. Like many other NASA scientist i do not beleive that it was an made by ancient civilazations of aliens. The pictures that we have taken from the planet Mars first indicated a type of face. But now that with our newer technology we've seen that it is just a mesa or butte. NASA has even provided real photos taken on the Mars. But still, many disagree that it is simply just a landform.

Nasa sending out the Viking 1 and bringing back that picture has made a big impact on NASA. Alot of scientist did not beleive that it was a face. But ""the Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. This ""Face on Mars"" starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout linesfor 25 years. But NASA scientist were still a bit doubtfull.

In 1998 NASA felt that it was important to tax payers to see the for sure if the ""the Face on Mars"" was really a face at all. When Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural alndform. So all these people believed that it was a face but it actually turned out, from real pictures taken, to be a landform.

But still not evryone was content with that. The ""Face on Mars"" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera that took the last picture of the ""Face on Mars"" had to peer through wispy clouds to see the ""Face"". So in April 8, 2001-a clodless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. And once again the even more advanced picture of the ""Face on Mars"" looked like a mesa or a butte.

Now some people will say that NASA is trying to cover up something, that they are hiding something from the public. Others say that NASA doesn't want people to know if there are aliens out there. But what people lack in that accusation is the fact that if NASA would've discovered aliens, it would be one of the most popular and profitable organizations on Earth. NASA trying to verify, by spending millions of dollars on global surveyors to take pictures of Cydonia, if the ""Face on Mars"" is really a face is not them trying to hide anything. In fact its NASA trying to satisfy the public in best ways they can. And people even say that the pictures arent good enough to tell for sure. NASA's surveyor's camera pixel in 2001 had a span of 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

So in conclusion, even though you dont beleive that its a natural landform, and i understand why, facts and real photos beg to differ that idea of a face on the Mars. All the times NASA has sent out surveyors to bring pictures to the public, the public just gave them garbage. So honestly all i can say is that all the facts and pictures that NASA has provided us with to understand the face or landform is for a reason. And thats so people can see and decide for themselves wheather it a face or a landform. But really if a scientist and an entire corporation of intellegiant scientist with high degrees say its a landform, then that they're aren't going to lie to an entire planet of people.

cb53110,"The Unmasking Face on Mars is just a natural landform on Mars. Many objects on Earth can resemble a face it could just be a mountain of sand that some how looks like a face. In the article it claims of huge rock formation that ""resembles"" a face. The picture was taken by a space craft at a far away distance forming shadowing giving the ""illusion"" of a nose, eyes, and mouth.

First, the reason why the ""face"" is a natural landform is because on Earth you can compare a face in many objects around you. Some natural landforms on Earth such as Middle Butte in the Snake river Plain of Idaho looks like it has a face also. You can make out a face in even day to day objects. Even a tree near your neighborhood could look like a ""face"".

Secondly, the reason why the ""face"" is just a natural landform is because the huge rock formation causes shadows. The shadows of the huge formation of rock can create the illusion of a face. The shadows can make it look like it has a nose, eyes, and mouth like structure in cases such as this one.

Lastly, the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform because the photo was taken by a satelite. The pictures come in pixels meaning it could come out blury or unclear to clarify. The shadowing of the mound also gives the illusion in the picture of a ""face"". The ""face"" on Mars is only a natural landform that was mistaken as something else more than that because of the illusion of a face.      ",3,1,0.8554743528366089

This face is actually just a common landform. Scientists have taken several pictures of the ""face"", and scientist would benefit from These are the reasons why I believe the Mars Face to be a simple landform.

My first reason is the fact that there are similar landforms like it on Earth and Mars. Such as mesas in the American west. One specific mesa is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. There is also several other landforms like it on Mars. The passage states that ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

My second reason is that scientists have photographic evidence that it is nothing more than a mesa. April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and His Mars Orbiter Camera team shot a picture ten times sharper then the original photos. Revealing that it was just a natural landform. April 8, 2001, Malin and his team took an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute Maximum resolution.

Some people might say that NASA would rather hide evidence of life on Mars, but NASA would actually benefit from an ancient civilization. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

These reason are why I believe the Face on Mars is only a natural landform.

cbd358f,"I believe that the so-called ""Face on Mars"" is actually just a rock formation that appears to be a face because of low-tech cameras from two decades ago. I'm going to explain why I believe that my claim is correct.

First, it is clearly obvious that the face only appers as a face because of low resolution cameras and odd shadows, as you can see from the most recent photographs of the rock face. Even in the 1998 picture it is pretty clear that it is not in fact a face but is just a rock formation. The clouds obscure some of the face in the 1998 picture so it might not be conclusive, but the 2001 picture proves it.

Also, if there were alien life of Mars, that would skyrocket NASA's budget to get to Mars because the public would be going crazy and the whole world would want to know. If there were alien life on Mars and NASA was the administration to discover it, the whole world's eyes and wallets would be on them, expecting them to put some men on mars to try to make contact with the Martian life forms, thus winning the race to put astronauts on Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a rock formation and nothing more than that. There are clear reasons as to why NASA would want this to be alien life more than anyone, and reasons why they would not keep it a secret from the public.",3,1,0.8815821409225464

I claim that it's a natural landform because it can be found on this earth. It wouldn't be a natural landform if it was not possible to find it anywhere. To confirmed it's identity, Mars global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997 after 18 years of the discovery.

If you were to use the camera that they used, you can identify any objects such as an airplane or Eygpt pyramid on Mars.

Overall, the Face is a natural landform. The landform is common around American West. Garvin stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

My opinion is that the way things move things could have crashed into it and made it look like a face. Its just something natural that happened. They don't have enough evidence to show what caused the face to form. Many things could have happened for the face to form but it doesn't mean that aliens or ancient things could of done this.

The passage shows 3 pictures one in 1978 which does look like a face in a way, 1998 still looks a face however whe see more landform features making it seem like a hill or a nose. If your still convice that the aliens made then jump to 2001 and we cracks going over some kind of plateau and if we squint it does look like a face but still looks can be decieving.

Now if your truly convince that aliens still made this then let say something else. In paragraph 12 this was said, ""The picture actually is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" This being said this means that just like on Earth there are landforms almost like the Martian face.

Lasly, if you think the pictures captured it wrong and should have more evidence then let's get a little science in this. In the paragraph the face from far away still does look like it however things like this is cause by sandstorms which sweeps up dust or makes in a way new landforms. The dust cause by this can even devour even one of our latest spaces suits and wait for it... land.

So all this being said means that this was cause by erosion, sandstorms, or just a regular landform. So what you thought was aliens trying to get some attention is just a peace of museum or map of a landform. So next if you want to think that aliens made something, remeber that you need more proof than just something that looks like a face or something. If we stll have to go on about this then we have some more talking and the next planet to be put in the conversation is Venus and more of Earth.",3,1,0.9004720449447632
ccc1098,"Dealing with the Face and researching it on my own I feel very confident to say that it is not made by aliens. My reasons being that if you see what looks like a face in a wall or maybe even a curtain or something of that sort does it mean that it is created by some alien or another unrealistic being?

In an article I read is said that the scientist believe and then it said that the theorist believe, so my question is, are you going to believe a theorist someone who probably hasn't even seen it in person over someone who has probably examined the face over a thousand times trying to come up with something reasonable and real evidence to give the people. A scientist said that he believed that is was a mesa or a butte. Yes, it is true that the government could be hiding aliens and their having the scientist just say that for there sack, but is it likely, no. The scientist have said that they think they've actually seen it somewhere. So maybe there not lieing and it seriously is just a mesa or a butte.

Garvin, a man who went to go see the face has said ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" and has also said ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars."" Does that seriously sound like he's lieing. Hes actually seen it and studied it and everything, and he has no reason to lie about it. But it is your descion you can believe him or you can believe the theroist. The article I read gave me lots of reasons why it wasn't an alien face that it was just nature being nature and the way the put it was very informative and told me that it was definetly just nature being nature.

While ending this, I would like to say that yes I believe the scientist that the landform looking like a rock was just mesa or a butte, but what do I really know im not a scientist. But still answer the question to yourself do you believe the scientist or do you believe the theoriest. ",3,1,0.6951202154159546
cd0a006,"Has someone ever told you that the face on Mars was real, but you knew it wasn't. The face on Mars is a natural landform called a mesa, but people mistake for a face because of the shadows it formed. The face on Mars is a natural landform because research with space crafts and the study pictures over time.

The face on Mars is a natural landform because of research with spacecrafts. Research with space crafts has shown that the face on Mars is just a landform. Many people thought the face was an alien artifact when it appeared in many books, a Hollywood film, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in haunted grocery store checkout lines. People still may not believe it, but there is more to say.

The face on Mars is just a mesa because of pictures shown overtime. The pictures between 1976 through 2001 show the face fading away. They show the face was nothing other than a moutain like landform. The pictures were taken with high-tech gear that they had back then. They were taken when Spacecraft Viking 1 was looking for another spacecraft, Viking 2. It was Snapping pictures and it got the face. Later, NASA found out it was just a mesa.

In conclusion, people still may believe that the face on Mars was real, but studies show that it was just a landform. The face on Mars is just a landform because of research with spacecrafts and and the study of the pictures over time. My final thoughts of this is that the face was cool until I saw that it was just a mesa. It was cool to learn about this, but it was just a goofy looking mountain.",2,1,0.921389639377594
cd11d3b,"In this prompt I will be writing an argumentive essay about comparing the two ideas from the story i read ''Un masking the face on mars"". The two two sides of this argument is wether the face isthink it is alien remains or natural landform. I personly think it is just an natural landform.

Why i think it is a natural landform is because there is no other sins of life so if there was aliens on mars why would they left a big face carved on a rick insted of something more alien like. Also like Garvin said the face also is very simular to a butte or mesa and the hase details are probly just weird shaperd errosion patterns that over time have come to look like the modern human face.

The face could also posibley be an alien artifact for more specsece to find. Much resuch has been done on mars to see if other human life is on it due to its closeness to the goldy locks zone withc is a obital zone that human life could potetionly live in like earth for example. The NASA teams have even found frozen water on Mars and that is one of the basic needs for animals considering we are over 70 percent water.

It is much more likly the face is just a natural land form though because of how much the size and shape resemple a butte or mesa from the mid west. Plus they're is more then one formation lik this this happens to be the only one is the shape of a htman face. You also have to consider they're is many natural formations who look like other thingd on earth.

In conclution It is a likly chance that the face is nothing more or less then a natural land form who happens to look like the modern humsn face, but we should not dought becuase no one knows for certain.",3,1,0.8550186157226562
cd151bf,"There is much evidence to show that the Face is a natural landform created by natural causes. In paragraph seven, it is stated that with higher quality the picture revealed the natural landform. Critics assume the landform is alien made due to the pictures taken in 1976. However, as technology evolved over the span of twenty five years, the landmark was found once again and revealed the Face. ''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'' said Jim Gavin. Gavin then compared the landform on Mars to other landforms such as the butte or mesa around the American West. Gavin also stated that a landform similar to the one on Mars was in Idaho, called the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Scientists also ruled out the possibility of an extrasteral force creating the landform. The Face was first thought to be another Martian mesa. A Martian mesa is common around the area of Cydonia. With taking these factors into consideration, the landform was simply created by natural causes over the millions of years. ",3,1,0.8683001399040222
cd32f6d,"Dear Reader,

Good Afternoon, You may know me as Dr. Ema R. I'm Head Scientist down at NASA. So today I'm going to tell you about the 'Face on Mars' some people think its just a funky looking rock. Well my friends they are wrong. Now your going to move on to my studying and research I have done to find out what it is and I'm pretty sure I found the right answer.

The 'Face on Mars' was found by us NASA, in 1976. It got very popular over the years then. By popular I mean appearing in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio, and even talk shows. Now, I know what your thinking. What was so popular about a landform on a planet other than ours? Well first, its not a landform, and second lets be completly honest here, if you were looking through a telescope and saw a face in the sky what would you do? You wouldn't shake it off and go to bed. At least I wouldn't, I would be showing it to everyone and try to turn it into NASA because you would be a hero for maybe finding life on another planet.

What I think about this 'Face' is very important to the people that work with me in the lab. When they find something they bring it to me and see my opion so they can go look to see if I'm right, I mean I always am. Anyways, I would like to share with everyone here aboout my opionon on this, when the lab workers first came and told me about it I thought that they were nuts, like really a face in the sky guys? Until, one night I was working late in the lab trying to find out what this whole thing is about so I went out to the sky room to look through the telescope. I was zooming until I found Mars, I was searching through the planet and saw the 'Face' and it indeed looked like a face. I searched for more, then thats when I put my research to work.

During that time of reasearch I found out a lot of things. In my lab I didn't do much work on Mars itself It was mainly, Saturn and Jupiter. The work I did on Mars made me think that we aren't the only planet with life. This 'Face' isn't a landform, its a lifeform. Thats when my research was finished and I talked to my boss about what I thought, he told me to anouce it to my lab crew and see what else we could find out. I made my lab crew stay after hours to see if we could possibly find more lifeforms. Let me tell you a few more things, the reason I thought it was a lifeform is thats what all the faces on Mars, if there is life, look like. When life on Mars dies they will bury them like we do.

Also, the way this 'Face' appeared there when it was buried. It got buried there forever ago and now the skull is popping up. So now the Space crew turned the Mars rover into an investagator if thats what you want to call it. The leaders would put it into motion and try to find more life forms or signs of life. Maybe these forms there, don't need to live with water and oxygen like we do they may just have to live off of sunlight or dirt maybe something crazy like that. NASA will one day find more evidence of lights on other planets.

I would like to thank you for reading my article, please if you think you have information about the 'Face' or other planets, contact us NASA on our website, www. NASA.com which also has an info hotline for you to learn more, and our Captains email. Thank You, once again.

Sincerely,

cd7d4a3,"If I was in this situation I would like tell them to take an even better camera. And my explanation for that is because if they want to have a more clearer picture then they should take another one up there. And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows. They might argue that im wrong because they might say that why will they need the technology and they might say like well we already have a picture and its a face. But it could possibly be something else. It could be a mountain with craters, it can be mostly anything. I also could be wrong becuase they do have a Mars rover up there so my theory can be wrong and it is a face all along. If I was the a scientist at NASA talking to someone about why the face on mars wasent created by aliens i would tell them that extra terrestrial life couldn't of done that because we dont have enough evidence to prove that they exist. But for now we don't know 100% that aliens did it or if metors hit it and it looked like a face or if aliens did it. And if aliens really did it then we need to get nother camera up there and see if there is any other life out there. Then the person who is asking that question would say ""havent you guys already put one up there and theres nothing"". Then I would come back and say then why do you think that aliens did it if we got nothing on the cameras that we sent up there. So he would be kind of wrong if we dont have any evidence that aliens are out there.",2,1,0.6028318405151367
cd9d88d,"The ""Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens. There is alot of evidence that proves this is correct.

In paragraph three the passage states that the landform was a ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."" This statement proves that aliens did not create this natural landform.

Paragraph seven also states the the image that was taken revealed a natural landform; Not an alien monument. People claimed that because it was a cloudy day when the picture was taken, the alien markings were hidden by haze. Scientists then took a picture of the landform on a clear, sunny day to prove them wrong; The picture was taken on April 8, 2001.

In paragraph twelve the article says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" These sentences add to the fact that the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform.

These three paragraphs are just a few statements that prove that the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. NASA is a very credible and trustworthy source to get this information from. Is your information about aliens credible?",3,1,0.9157292246818542

I don't see how people would think that aliens created that face we have never seen aliens and they have never seen us. Aliens don't even know what humans even look like. I think all the people that think aliens created that face should fly around the world and look for faces and I bet they will find some. If they find some then they can't say theat aliens came down to earth and did those to. But if they don't then NASA and I might think that aliens made the faces.

If they find faces on the earth then it will be all over and we will know that aliens didn't make them and that it is just a natural landform. On the otherhand if they don't then NASA will spend money and put some type of sensor ore camera or something on mars so that we can see at all times and we will know if aliens really built it or not.

Now tell me if you seen an alien on Mars what would you do?

All I am saying is in 1976 if aliens did make that face then why are we still here? Why haven't the aliens came yet ? Because if aliens were to make that face on Mars then that means they seen NASA's cameras circling their planet so they would've found a way to get them down.

There is not really facts or proof that aliens exsitst but there is not much proof or facts that can say there not real or where real. Im A sccientist at NASA and the Face on Mars in not really a face afterall. It is just a Land form.

25 years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Vicking 1 space craft was sircling the planete snaping photos of possible landing sites of its siter ship Vicking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end ot end seem to be stating back at the camers from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.When you think of aliens you think of green figures with big heads and big eyes right? Well when you were thinking about big head were you two miles from end to end big? No proubly not. If there were aliens with heads that big I am pretty sure that we would have found one by now at at least seen one , or had some kind of eveidence.

Scienstis figured it was just another Martian mese , common enought around Cydonia , the only thing that made this one uncommon was the unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptiam Pharaoh. The shadows are not all going to be the same on/ by all of thease Martian mesa's. Some are going to be weird/Unusal. People schould expect that and not expect the first unusal shadows to be something this important. An Alien head. A few days later NASA unveilded the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""Huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illustion of eyes , nose and mouth""

This face on Mars gave NASA a lot of attention. This idea of a face on mars ended up in Hollywood films , appreaed in books , magazines , radion talk shows and even haunted grocerty store checkout lines for 25 years. The face had become so pouplar there were proubly people out there trying to say/prove the head was actually a head and not a landform. That could of made lots of people belive that there is really a head. Some people think that Face is bona fide evidence of life on mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide says conspiary theroirtst. Meanwhile defneders of the NASA bugget wish there was an ancient civization on Mars. If there was a face on Mars why would NASA try to hide something that huge. That could get there space program more attention and prossibley more money even.

The ""Face "" had its picture taken 3 times with 3 diffrent cameras.Each time NASA took a picutre of the face the picture was more clear. The first picture was in 1976 , the secound picture was in1998 and the last and most recent picture was in 2001. In thease picutes you can almost see a face in the first picture taken in 1976. When NASA took a picture of the face in 1998 you can tell there is not really an entire face there. In 2001 NASA's photo is more clear than the other two and you can tell that there is not a face. It is just a landformation. Some people argure that in April '98 it was a cloudy time of year ont he Red Planet. The camera on Board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Phehaps , said skeptics , aline markings were hidden by haze. Nevertheless , pn April 8, 2001 - a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mards Global Surveyor drew close enoguht for a secound look.""We had to rool the spacecradter 25 degresseto center the Face in the deild of weird,"" Said garvin. ""malin's team captured an extraordinary photot using the camers's absolute maximum resoultion.

But to belive that the ""thing"" in the picture was a face and not a landform is kinda bizar. You call tell in the 2001 picture that it is not a face after all if is just a landform.

As the years go by, the image of the ""face"" becomes more clearer as the picture before. NASA's Viking 1 first captured the first picture of the ""face"".

People everywhere are fascinated by what scientists have discovered on Mars. The ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. It appeared in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even checkout lines at the grocery store. Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Few scientists believe that the Face was an alien artifact. I believe that the face on Mars is a natural landform, and was not created by aliens.

It is still not scientifically proven that there is life or was life on Mars. To this day, scientists are still trying to figure out if there is or was life on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The team aboard captured a picture that was sharper than the previous picture. This picture still revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. I know, that after this, people are still not satisfied. Remember, that the camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Skeptics say that alien markings may have been hidden by the haze.

Since this might not be enough proof to convince you into thinking that the Face was formed naturally... we decided to go take a picture of the face once more. This time it was clearer and bigger. If there were things on the ground, you would be able to see what they were. The picture shows the Martian equvalent of a mesa- landforms common around the American West. In America, most of our landforms are created naturally, and Garvin said that the Face reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

I think that the only reason why people think that aliens formed this Face on Mars was because of the books, magazines, and film. The film could have incorporated ideas into someone's head into thinking that aliens did create this. The Face is just a natural landform. Aliens couldn't have created this ""face"", because it would've taken them a long time, and how would they know what humans look like?

The atmosphere around Mars could have helped shaped this. Maybe the air, shifted the dust and rocks on Mars, moving it into an object that looks like a human face. There are many possible ways on how this face was created by the natural enviroment. ",4,1,0.8650768995285034

ce9e15e,"In 1976 there was a mysterious face found on the planet Mars. I'm a scientist at NASA space station discussing some accusations about this face. Some people are beginning to believe that the face was created by aliens. However, that is not the case here. This mysterious face was simply created by natural causes and happens to just have distinct features of a human face.

My first reason as to why this face is a natural landform is because there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed on Mars, or anywhere else. If there is no proof of these aliens living then how could they have possibly been able to create such an artifact. Plus, believing that this was caused by natural causes is way more believable then relying on unproven research that aliens once existed.

My second reason to this being just a natural landform is scientists believe the nose,eyes, and mouth of the figure are created by shadows giving it an illusion of a human face. This attracted the public which is exactly what NASA wants. So, NASA is using the illusion of this human face to attract more attention to their program and Mars itself. By doing this it is making most people believe the face was created by aliens, which it in fact wasn't. Evidence of this is when the article, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

My third and final reason this mysterious face is just a natural landform is that is resembles features of landforms common in American West. For example, Garvin states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" Garvin also says. If this face resembles American Western landforms so much then it must be a natural landform itself.

Although there are reasons this face wasn't created by aliens there are some conspiracies involving NASA. One is that people believe NASA has already found traces of life on Mars and would rather keep that sceret from the public. This is believable because NASA wouldn't want to alarm the public of extraterrestrial lifeforms and create panic. Although it could create panic, NASA should want to inform the public because it could cause support of NASA and thier findings instead. For example, people could start donating money to the company to help with further research and have more knowledge about what they do.

This mysterious face on the surface of Mars is no more than a natural landform. It was not caused by aliens because there is no scientific proof. NASA wants the public to believe it is a cause by aliens so they could get more publicity for it. I mean, this face has already starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. It's had enough publicity and does not deserve anymore because of the fact that it is just a natural landform caused by natural changes, not aliens.            ",5,1,0.8899203538894653

The text states, ""Although few scientist beleived the Face was an alien artifact.""

The few scientist thought that it was made by aliens therefore, they didn't have any evidence.

Nevertheless, NASA unveiled the image for all to see and the caption was noted a ""huge rock formation.""

So at the beginning they figured it was a rock but they didn't say anything about it being created by aliens.

Evidence is a very important thing for scientist.

Many people learned what the ""Face"" was when they revealed it to the public.

The author reveals, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.""

They said it was a natural landform because they zoomed up on it and could see no aliens..

For 25 years the face has been in magazines and it has even been in hollywood movies.

All of them said it was a natural landform.

Many people were excited about the Face.

If aliens created it they would have left evidence, like a shrine, monument, or you could see them in pictures.

After publishing it the author says, "" There was no alien monument after all.""

That proves that it was not created by aliens, but many people disagreed.

Everyone were not satisfied because they thought aliens created it.

Although, some skeptics said alien markings were hidden by a haze.

But the scientist did not think that, so they went out again and looked for the face to take more pictures.

The Face was located in Cydonia it is a hard place to locate.

The picture from 2001 was more clear than the one from 1975.

The pictures didn't show any monument of aliens and they could not tell they were even there.

Lots of evidence proves aliens did not create the Face.

What the face is described is a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

The article states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

That states it looks like a landform from Earth.

This proves that no matter what people think it was not created by aliens.

The Face is just a natural landform and it wasn't created by aliens.",3,1,0.8750921487808228

Witch is pretty exicting because this is a big planet and every planet we discove is a new chance to find other life than the earth because if we have more knoledge about what outer space than we can go to the planets and maybe use the for our selfes or if their are any plant we can use / grow them here on earth.

So about 25 years ago NASA'S Viking one space ship was circleing the planet taking photos for a posible landing ship viking 2 when it spotted the shadowy likness of a human face.

An strange head nearly 2 miles away. The face on Mars have scine become a popular icon. It has been talked about everywhere.

It was a bid hit on NASA's Alot of people wanted to see the Face On Mars. The Face On Mars has starred in a hollywood film along with magazines and other products that could cause talk about The Face On Mars. Scientist bealived that the faces wher Alien artifact.

This story was about how the Face on mars was regonized all over the world and scientists are still trying to figure out what this face was, was it an artifact or was it just a strange dent/ crator in the mars land. But even till this day the world may never figure out what this strage face was or where it may have came from .",1,1,0.8239427804946899
ceec53f,"It seems that others still believe in the theory that the natural landform was created by aliens, even though the face on Mars was finally unmasked.

When it was first just discovered, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Only a few scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact.

Scientists wanted to prove that the face was just a landform and nothing more, so they soon come up with a plan. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Glabal Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The first image that appeared on a JPL web site revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument.

However, not everyone was satisfied with the results. It took another journey; Mars Global Surveyor went for a second look in Cydonia on April 8, 2001. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. The image was three times bigger than the pixel size.

With these final results, the questioning of the face on Mars should be concluded. The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa - landforms common around the American West. The human shaped face on Mars was no alien artifact after all, it was only a natural landform this entire time.",3,1,0.8367229104042053

A close neighbor, Mars, is one of the most famous sci-fi planets of all. Movies, books, etc. have been made based on Mars. Martians or even just plain old aliens have been the tall tale of our time, but could a discovery change the argument between aliens being fake or real. The Face on Mars is a turning point for all people. I am a scientist at NASA who strongly believes that the Face is just a landform on Mars surface because over time the picture quality has gotten better and has made the pictures of the Face come out clearer making it easier to see the definition of the shape.

The first sighting or picture taken of the Face was in 1976. The Viking 1 was circling the planet, snapping photos for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2 when a picture was snapped of what looked like a human face. Regular citizens were shocked at the photo along with scientists. This picture as seen is very blurry. Definition of the landmark is not very clear and with that picture comes many questions; What is this thing? How did it get there? Why is it there? So many questions that no one could answer. So us as humans jumped to the most conclusive answer would could come up with and the answer was that it was made by aliens. NASA quickly turned down the accusation because there was no evidence supporting the idea. In the text the author said, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This shows how different the picture quality is between 1976 and 2001. Also many people were not satisfied with the picture eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. So on April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking pictures. Thousands of people wanted to see another glimpse of the Face maybe even a better one. The image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. After eighteen years of conspiracy it was proven that the Face was a mesa.

In conclusion the picture from 1998 is how I prove that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture quality has changed dramatically and has put conspiracy theorists in their place. I strongly believe that NASA tried to be on the peoples' side, afterall no one really knew what the Face was at first. As we continue on discovering our universe we will surely come across many inccidents like the Face and maybe one day the outcome won't be the same.       ",4,1,0.9154518842697144

Our caption noted a huge rock formation wich made it look like a human face. Some authors reasoned that it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars by saying that aliens had created that human face on Mars.

We sent out a Global Surveyor to see and take a picture of the ''face"". It arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997 18 years after the Viking mission ended.

The ""Face"" on Mars in simply an ordinary mesa.

The original picture of the ""Face"" was captured in 1976. Since that time ouR camera have improved, allowing us to see images more clearly.

Again when the second picture was taken in 1998 camera were improving, but not as efficient as the camera used to take the final picture.

Martian mesa can even be compared to an ordianry Earth mesa!

This mesa attracted a lot of attention from the media because of the way the shadows fell across the mesa, creating a face-like illusion.

The only thing that made this particular mesa any different from every other mesa on the surface of Mars was the coincedincial way the shadows fell across it.

In the pictures shown in the article, the face changes as any fossil or landmark would on Earth. The jump from 1976 to 2001 is a big chance of what it would look like if it were on Earth. As said in the article, the JPL web site says it was a natural landform, not an alien monument. The only reason that the rumors of alien monuments still exsisted is because there were people who were still not satisfied.

Another reason that the alien monument rumors were false is because even with a cloudless day in Cydonia, it still appeared as a natural landform. Granted, the rumors of clouds blocking the actual image of the face was a logical argument. However, they even took pictures on a cloudless day, and it still appeard as a natural landform.

The theory that this was an alien civilization is totally inacurate. The pictures clearly show the actions of the face.

They even went as far as saying that the aliens had errased it. LIke how far will they go with this thing. All of this because of a huge rock and a mistaken picture. So when people still wanted more and NASA did to they tried again hoping for a mirical. They still wanted more out of this rock. The only reason NASA didnt shut this down was because they need the fame and money. This picture ended up becoming a pop icon. It starred in a holloywood film,appeared in magizines,radio talk, and shows. Whey would they think of shuting it down. So they led people into thinking that this was some alien race marking. So when things were dying down they hoped for another miricle and sent anothe spaceship up into spacejust to show people it was just a rock again.

So out of this rock they ended up getting a couple years of fame and a very large fan base. To this day Nasa keeps the roomer going around. I think this picture was just and accident that turned into a trophie for NASA.They made sure to make the most of it but knew they couldnt hold it for long. They knew it was a perfect story to spark a conversation between thousands of people so theybrought it out just to do that. NASA used it for they're copminy but at the end it was just a rock,just like they found it.            ",2,1,0.6772172451019287
d198ebf,"Twenty five years ago a face was discovered on mars. NASA said that it was a rock that resembles a face. The rock had the look of eyes, nose, and a head. This is something that NASA and us scientist have never seen before. NASA hasn't figured out if it really is a face or just a rock. The face theory's do not make any scince.

The face has become an icon as it has made apperences in movies, books, and magazines. Many scientist have thought that the cause of the face was because of aliens. Then NASA wanted to figure out what it was so they sent a Orbiter Camera. They found out that there was no alien resemblence at all. The face was very hard to find. As it states in the article ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was wunter in April '98 a cloudy time of year"" (page 8, Unmasking the Face on Mars).

""It's not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. ""In fact it's hard work"" (page 9, Garvin). The face was hard to detect and took a lot of work to figure out what it really is. Scientist are still doing research on the face shaped rock. They are even sending space crafts with camera's to take pictures of the face. So far, they are not having any luck on getting a picture that isn't blurry. The face has become one of the most interesting and confusing things in science and still hasn't been solved today.

d1ce732,"Unreal Theories & Magazine Believings

I believe the face on mars is a natural landform. I believe this because, in a few paragraphs, they say that it can't be possible and that they took a picture and that wasn't the case. My three examples from the text are in paragraph 11, paragraph 7, and paragraph 9. The face on mars is a landform, and i could prove it to you.

In paragraph 11 it shows that this so called ""face"" is actually not a real face. It says in paragraph 11, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see wat they were"". I think that this ""fact"" is actually kind of unreal. For example, if you take a picture of the sun, and you make the picture 3 times bigger than that size, you wont see how the real sun looks because the picture doesnt have all the good pixels you need to get a perfect picture. Its almost to never when someone has a perfect picture and you can see every detail of the picture.

In paragraph 7 it states ""Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared in a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"". Thats one of the best examples i have so far because, if they went up to mars to check out if this face was real or fake and it ended up to be fake, AND they have proof, of course its not going to be real. some people still believe that the face is still real as it says in paragraph 8. Some people were so anxious to have the answer, that they started to have theories about the planet. as it says in paragraph 8,""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze"". If anyone has heard me, i have said SKEPTICS. They said that for a reason to let people know that answers is better than a hypoothesis.

My last example is from paragraph 9. In paragraph 9, it says that "" Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often,"" he noted"".

They dont pass over the face very often because if you think about it, they just look straight down and scan the planet. The planet doesn't swirl on different sides. it stays in something that is called orbit. Orbit is something used for the plant to go in circles. it doesn't go everywhere like a regular sphere on earth, it has to stay in one place.

I believe that the Face isnt a real face, but actually a landform. I have chosen Those few examples to change your mind about how you feel about the Face, when, in all reality, its a landform. I believe I can change your mind about the feeling of knowing that this Face is a natural landform, most likely made by a meteor hitting the planet.",3,1,0.7385132312774658
d1d32ad,"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circiling Mars and snapping photos of possible laninding sites. It spotted what looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. There are many conspiracy theorists that think this is proof of life on Mars. I disagree. The article states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" The face like shadows that were captured on Mars can be compared to landforms on Earth. I think that what is thought to be a face, is just a hill-type mass with shadows that look like a face at certian angles. The article also says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeares on JLP web site, revealing . . . a nautural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" So what this means is that the landform has nothing to with life on Mars, just the planet itself. When NASA released the picture, they captioned it, ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" I personally think that what they had captioned the photo is all you need to know about what it is, a huge rock foundation. If what NASA captured was an actual aliens face, they claim they would release that information because it would do so much good for them. With scientists who studied the pictures, the declaired it was only a landmass. So without the evidence of other life on Mars, that's all anyone can call it for now.",3,1,0.888279914855957

In May 2001, a spacecraft from NASA spotted something on Mars that they thought looked like a face, but it really isn't. I agree it does look relatively like a face, but I am here to tell you the truth about what that face really is.

What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Jim Garvin said ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" If you don't know what that is, its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Clydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.(which were not very clear) Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for NASA to share the picture. As they posted the picture online, it revealed that it was clearly not a face created by aliens, it was just a landform that looked like a face.

But after NASA showed the whole world that there was no face on Mars, not everyone was satisfied. They even said that the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. And that it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on Mars. They also said that since it was such a cloudy time on Mars that the camera made a mistake because it had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Some skeptics even said that perhaps alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze.

I can assure you that those rumors may seem logical, but they are not real at all.

Our cameras did not make any mistakes and Mars ""face"" is just a landform. If you ever hear from anyone that Mars has a face you can tell them that it isn't real and that there are no such thing as aliens on mars nor will there ever be.",3,1,0.8906446695327759
d20e3ae,"Although it may seem that there is a ""face"" on Mars, there isn't. There have been conspiracy theories that the ""face"" on Mars is part of the remains of an alien, but that is not true. There are many good reasons to why the object that looks like a face isn't a face.

After studying the ""face"" on Mars, we have many theories to what it may actually be. Chief scientist of the NASA Mars Exploration Program Jim Gervin thinks that the ""face"" is actually a butte. A butte is a naturally made landform usually found around the American West. Like in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is a butte called Middle Butte. It very well looks like what we see on Mars called the ""face"". There are many other theories of what the for may be.

I know that many people have been saying that the rock formation on Mars is a face, but it isn't. There are no real reasons to how that formation could be an alien's head. In 1976 the ""alien head"" does look a lot like one, but if you look at the 2001 picture it looks nothing like one. That gives away that the ""face"" was just complete luck for it to look like that. In magazines they have been saying that the ""face"" was real, but can you always trust magazines. Magazines will lie sometimes so that they get a story that people will want to read. You can't really determine that the ""face"" is actually a face.

In conclusion, the ""face"" is not a face. Although it may have seemed like a face to a lot of people, it wasn't. Later on this will be a time to laugh at because some people actually thought that the rock formation was a face. ",3,1,0.8563681244850159

Providing evidence is not just having a theory with people backing you up. Evidence is providing proof, proof is pictures lab tests and finding all possiblities that that is the only thing it could be. The article however cannot provide proof or hardly any evidence there are living things on Mars.

The article does provide a picture, but the picture is nothing but a mear misunderstanding. The picture provided is what is called a lava dome, simply shapes creating the form of a face. People like to take little things and make them into something just because they can. Many people are making a large amount of money off of this discovery and that's what people are after now, people care about money and publisity. This scientific breakthrough is nothing but a scam really.

People want to believe what they hear and so most of the time they will. Things can be photoshopped now a days with all the new technology so I suppose you can never know for sure. New discoveries are scary and scientists will keep on discovering the world and even whats outside of our world but there's no gaurentee this is a real ailen artifact. Things form together and make random shapes, this shape on Mars just so happened to be a face, big deal that doesn't mean anything. The image might also be slightly blurred, purhaps taken at an angle at which forms it into a face. Angle is everuthing, angle can make something look like it actually isn't, it plays tricks on your mind and your eyes.

This landform gives off the illusion that it is a face.

To clear all confusion, the Face on Mars wasn't created by aliens.

As the cameras traveled around Mars what appeared to be a head from end to end stretching two miles was actually a Martian mesa.

Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia therefore NASA made the assumption that it was.

This Martian mesa was a bit different than the others.

This one had unusual shadows that gave off the look to be an Egyptian Pharaoh but was still considered a mesa.

Secondly, this landform was common around the American West.

This butte or ""mesa"" was just more oddly shaped than the others. This landform was created by a lava dome which caused it to look like a face somehow.

Garvin refrenced the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho which is another idea that it was just a landform.

On the contrary, this could be an alien made figure. The landform gave off an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

The passage also stated the landform stretched two miles from end to end which made the ""head"".

If the structure was bona fide that means it was well-rounded and nicely structured which means it took time to come together then it was done by what we call a second life.

NASA would rather hide that being afraid of conspiracy theorists.

d2d299b,"The face on Mars is a natural landform. We have proven it here at NASA. We have taken pictures on different years and it has shown to change. Our new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from our Mars GLobal Survey spacecraft reveal the face on mars for what it really is. It is just a mesa. This is common on earth on the west side of the United States. Another reason it wasn't made from any alien or creature out there is because the moniters never found any monuments like that one and aliens moving around.

For people who think aliens did this, say that our camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds which we couldn't see much, think the aliens were probably hiding. people who believe in aliens strongly are going to find the slightest detail and use that for their evidence. Since this was a popluar icon more and more people are going to lie and make up stuff to make sure people believe it is true. They already made up a lie that we would rather hide from the aliens. These people are called conspiracy theorists.

The biggest proof we have that it wasn't made my aliens is our digital image. This was 3 times bigger than the pixel size. It would be able to see if there were objects in this picture like monuments or aliens. It could even see small shacks if there were any. Our spacecraft got to look at it a second time in 2001 and could see more better than the 1976 one. There was still nothing to be found but a natural landform.

Even if we did catch aliens in our picture we showed the same picture to the public for all to see. Nobody said they found an alien structure. If we didn't detect neither would anybody else.

This is why conspiracy theorists will always remain conspiraces. Because they have no soild evidence against us. We have acutul research to back us up. We kept looking at and studying it until we finaly came up with an answer to tell the world what it is.                 ",3,1,0.8727554082870483
d2d7ffb,"What is your view on the ""Face of Mars?"" This is a very interesting topic. There are many different points of view for the ""Face on Mars."" Although, there are two main concepts. The first is based off of research. Many people at NASA believe in this point of view. The people that believe this idea is true and think that the face is just a natural landform. The second is based off of conspiracy. This idea is based off of external life outside of Earth. The people that believe in this point of view think that aliens have created this landform.

I myself believe in the research part of the concept. There is just not enough physical evidence to say that it is aliens. This is just an idea that many conspiracy theorists believe. Sometimes their theories can be a little enticing, but they never really have any evidence to back up any of it. The idea of aliens making this lanform had been created by some ""very creative"" minds and was probably thought of when the pictures weren't high enough quality to make anything out of them.

Now lets say that there are aliens living on Mars. In order for them to make this landform, they would have to know about humans. They would have to know what a human face looked like. They would also have to know that we are smart enough to be studying them and they would have to be smart enough to study us. The chances of them finding out all of this information without ever getting recognized by anybody are slim to none. Again, it all coms back to research. There is no evidence of aliens. Therefore, nobody can argue that this landform was made by life outside of Earth.

Now personally, I agree with the scientists that had first discovered this ""Face on Mars."" This is just merely another Martian Mesa. The odd shadows are common around Cydonia and it just happened to be an odd combination of them. I honestly think that is all there is to it.

Now what do you believe? Do you think it is an alien artifact? Or is it just a natural lanform? I hope this persuaded you to think on the more scientific side of things, because trust me it will help you in the long run.         ",4,1,0.902301549911499

A Martian mesa. That's all the face is. It was created by a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated messa, with shadows that give it the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Martian mesas, are common enough around Cydonia, which is another reason why this could'nt have been created by aliens. Lastly, this couldn't have been aliens, because there is not enough scientific proof to even know if there is even any form of life on mars.

Even though most people believe that it is a natural landform, some do believe it was aliens who created it.

So, there is nothing to worry about. If you don't believe me, just keep reading... and you will soon learn it is just your imagination. But some people probably never will learn. Till then, just read this... Maybe I will change your mind if you really believe it is a face. Or maybe I won't. Let's see what you choose.

First, it just your eyes messing with you! Your eyes can play tricks on you and make you see things that are not really there. This is just rocks oddly placed and the rocks have shadows. That it all your seeing. If it were really a so called ""face"" on Mars, that would mean there would have to be life on Mars before. Have they proven life on Mars? They only found traces of water in the past. So, there could have been life on mars, but we haven't found anything besides this Face. Yes, if we found more ''faces'' we could consider it. But, we haven't, and there isnt enough evidence to support it.

Also, over the past 25 years... we've seen the Face everywhere in papers.

This could all be a scam, people are just trying to get people intrested in Mars more. There is always false advertisment in commercials, news articles, ect. This is just another one of those! We would have found something out in 25 years. And what do you know? Nothing. All there is, is a picture. They even took a picture a second time and still found nothing,said it was just a natural landform. So, there is NOTHING to worry about.

Say this is a alien artifact... Do you have anything else besides the Face that they've? Are aliens even REAL?? Nobody really knows because there is only skepitics. Let's be honest about this, it's NASA. There are very intelligent people there. I'm sure the best of the best. They wouldn't lie about some rocks would they? No... but people believe what they choose. People's eyes see what they want to see. Hear what they want to hear, no matter what the truth is. If you were to ask anyone about the face being an alien artifact or it just being a natural landform, not everyone would agree.

All of the rocks could have moved over time and made the Face. Honestly, your eyes are just playing tricks with you. They are showing you something that isnt there. It is only shadows. Nothing else. Is it odd it is shaped to look like a face? Of course yes. This is all like ''Big Foot'' people are just making up stories. And seeing a tree but they think it is Big Foot's shadow. Your going to soon grow out of it and come to your senses. That it is just a natural landform. Not a face or alien artifact. IF they actually find evidence... more then just some pictures. Actual proof... maybe, things will be differen't sure. Till then, just use your logic. Do you really think it is something more then rocks?

I hope I've at least made you consider that the face is a landform. If I didn't... well maybe no one will. But I know what I believe is true. IT IS JUST A LANDFORM. And until you give ME evidence to your side of the story. You can't change my mind either. Fair enough, right?

Also why would NASA try to hide the fact that there was aliens on Mars when it would clearly benefit them alot.

The mesa or butte on mars is nothing but so. Saying that the government is hiding something like that kindof sounds dumb.

Also dont you think NASA would have made a bigger deal about the ""face"" it was a real face. All in all the face just got blown out of proportion when it is just a rock.

If you are about to blame the camera and say it was the cameras fault and how it is a face and not a mesa you are wrong. First: NASA stated that they would take a better picture so why would they lie? Second: NASA would not spend all the money it took to get the spacecraft up in space to take a picture if it was not real. Third: if they did spend the money to get it up there why would they send a crappy camera? Fourth: NASA also stated they was going to wait for a clear day too so it is not clouds. The camera was fine, the weather was fine,and the image is completely real too.

If ther was really aliens on mars it would benefit them alot. Think about it why woul NASA lie about something helpful. If there were aliens on Mars NASA would get billions and billions of dollors to study them. Also if there were aliens why would we keep it a secret any way,because what if they had technolligy we didn't wouldnt we already have it? If there were aliens wouldnt they have already discovered us, so if they had bad intentions we would already be at war.

d338bff,"In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit. Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars.

One reason that consiracy theorist could beleive that this could be an alien stucture is that the resolution of the first picture was very low. In paragraph 10 it says,"" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the ""face on Mars"". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.

But even after these new pictures conspiracy theorist were still bent on the idea that NASA was trying to cover something up. In spite of the new pictures people said that the day the photo was taken, it was cloudy. Therefor the photos couldn't be very accurate. In fact, these theorists were right. The day the photo was taken was in winter. It says in paragraph 8 that, "" ... it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" These facts show that the landmass could indead be hidden by clouds. However, NASA still supported their claim that it was just a misinterpreted natural landform.

While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. What these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic. With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,"" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion, the face on mars is supported and not supported. NASA has proven with photographic evidence that it is just a natural occurance while conspiracy theorists say that it is a martian civilization.

The land erodes. There are a lot of things that are natural and look like faces.

But, it still might not be natural. No the rock formation is natural.

First off, it could be a computer image hicup. What I mean is That the camera that is moving takes different pictures of one area as its moving. I can relate to another ""alien"" sighting. A comet passing earth was thought to be a triangular UFO

but the telescope took three different pictures at once and gave it that UFO shape.

Secondly, The land erodes over time. The land could have eroded land could cause a ""face"" to appear. This ""face"" is nothing more than a simple act of nature and its way. In the top picture over time you can see it erode away, especialy the 1998 photgraph.

Thirdly, We see things that look like faces everyday, wether its clouds or land formations. We see our faces everyday, so its easy to compare. In the top picture you can see a land formation, but scince we know what a face looks like its easy to compare to. In the picture, yes we can see some definition but its still just a land form. For example the man in the moon, it looked like a face but wasn't.

On the other hand, it might be. Most theorists claim it appears to be an Egyptian Pharoh. The theorists also claim that the martians built the pyramids. It's a theory but it might be possible.

In conclusion, No it is a natural landform. It could be a computer image hicup.

The land erodes. There are a lot of things that are natural and look like faces.

But, it still might not be natural. If it is unnatural then there could be other life out there.   ",3,1,0.8749814033508301

There is no evidence of life on Mars. There isn't even water or oxygen. Without water or oxygen, the planet cannot sustain such life. Futhermore, natural land formations on earth do exist like this. In Paragraph 12, Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

So even if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The 2001 photo taken of the face shows that it really spans 1.56 meters, not 43 meters. This also clarifies that aliens didn't create this object, because it's measurements are closet to that of natural formations found on Earth.

Looking at the Evidence provided, we can discern, friend, that this isn't the work of aliens. The research provided by NASA has no record on file of any extra-terrestrial lifeforms. Also, the research indicates that this is natural because the formation's measurements are closer in proximity to Earth landforms.

Couple days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The face on Mars has since become a pop icon. Some scientists believed the face was an alien artifact.

On April 5, 1998 when MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Revealing a natural landform. there is no alien monument after all. Some people was not satisfied because they wanted to believe it was an actually alien artifact. But no, the MGS had to go take another photo to prove its a landform.

Some people ain't satisfied because they think the camera didnt get a good enough pictures of the alien markings cause they were hidden by haze. Everyone is wishing its alien face on Mars but instead they are getting a landform. Gravin says that they dont pass over the face very often because its not easy to find Cydonia.

On the side of Mars, there seemed to be a landform that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Many people believed this to be a sign of life on Mars, but it really is not.

If the image from Mars did infact prove that there is life on Mars, NASA would benefit greatly. ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars---evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Why would NASA lie about this if telling the truth meant more funding?

NASA has tried over and over again to prove that the Face is just a landform; we just won't listen. ""We felt this was important to taxpayers,' explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. 'We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.""

The image is showing us that there is a butte on Mars, of which scientists have made many comparisons to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Of course there might be life on Mars, but there's no way to know for sure. Blaming NASA for lying about the discovery of ""aliens"" is just simply illogical. NASA is an organization that explores space and everything in it, hoping to find something they can share with the world.

First and formost, Martians have been wafting around the population; because of the amount of time it has been around and all of the conspiracy, this has lead many conspirarists to go to extremes to prove that anything that anyone can believe in is real. For instance, now people are starting to prove that aliens are real because of a big face-shaped mountain on Mars. This is, of course, completely absurd to say the very least, due to the lack of evidence they have in corrispondence to the large amount of evidence that we at NASA already have. Really though-- all they have are sci-fi movies, fiction novels, and talk-shows-- when we have already proven that it is obviously just an odd formation (that with shadows, angles, and imagination) just looks like a face. After the Mars Global Surveyor flew by Cydonia one day in April, it was completely proven to be just your average land formation. Afterwards, skeptics still were not satisfied, even with the incontroversial evidence that all it was was a rock formation. So, we flew by AGAIN, just to prove that that was all it was.

Scientists have tooked camera over and there is no alien monument after all, But how do you get the others to believe thats theres not. Not everyone was satisfied. The face on mars is located 41 degress north latitude. The camera they had been using had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. They said the aliens marks may have been hidden by haze but some didn't even think that their were aliens marking and said that it is just a natural landform, but then again how could they prove it.

The poor quality cameras back in 1976 are nothing compared to the ones in 2001. There are photos of the landform from 2001 that make it look nothing like a face. The most recent photos have been taken on a cloud less day, with the resolution up as far as it would go. This means that the photo was as sharp as it possibly could be. If there were any small structers next to the landform, you could also see those.

There is a preconcieved notion that NASA is hiding the discovery that the face is alien made. Why would NASA want to hide it though?

In conclusion, scientists from NASA have proved that this face from Mars is just a

natural landform and aliens did not create it. NASA has given many reasons and even proof that this is not made by aliens.

Although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars global surveyor [MGS] arrived at the red planet in sSeptember 1997 eighteen long years after the viking missions ended. So it was true that aliens did not do that to mars because aliens are not real and also NASA even said that they did it on mars they said it was an accident that happened in September 1997. Also in April 5,1998 ,when Mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time,Micheal malin and his mars obiter camera [MOC] team snapped the picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos.",2,1,0.8108800649642944

What the picture actaully show is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common aroung the American West.

The face is a natural landform because it was there to draw attention to mars which it did. ""The author's reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars which it certainly did"". The face on Mars became a pop up icon. It starred in hollywood films, books,magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines. Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.

d5591f4,"Do you believe the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens?

I have done some research with NASA and have to say that it was not created by aliens and is just a natual landform. What looks like something made by aliens is just a natural landform on Mars that happens to look like a face. The formation on Mars is a natural landform. It was not created by aliens because photos show no other signs of civilization, improved photos show a natural landform, and if there was life that created it, NASA would have used that to their advantage.

Photos taken by NASA show no other objects or landforms created by aliens. The research stated that the digital image could discern things three times bigger than the pixel size. Garvin said, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This shows that if aliens did make the monument, there would have been some other proof or sign that they did it. Not only was this research helpful but so was the picture that showed it all.

The high def photo cameras showed that the believed alien monument was just a natural landform. Shadows were casted on the landform making it look like a face. The text says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the America West."" The landform was the same as any old natural landform found here on Earth. This shows how the ""Face on Mars"" is not alien created but If it was NASA would have said so.

If there was aliens that created this, than NASA would have told everyone and all media because it would be a benefit to them. There would be much money going to them if there was life on Mars. In the story, it says, ""Meanwhile, Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" If NASA had found any evidence of life, they would have said, so they could get some money rolling in. This was a big fact that showed how aliens did not create the formation.

In conclusion, the natural formation was not made by aliens because photos showed no life of civilization, improved photos showed a natural landform, and if there was life NASA would have used that as a benefit for themselves. Photos did not find any evidence of life to show how conspiracy theorists would be right. If NASA found any sign of aliens they would have told. NASA will have to keep doing what they are doing and do more research. The ""Face on Mars"" is just another natural landform that we are used to.       ",4,1,0.8853092193603516
d596c5a,"The ""face on Mars"" isnt even a real face, it's an illution. I know that because of thhe article. The article has some interesting things to say. Including that it's not a real human or any of that nonsense. I know that for a fact and here are some reasons that it's not a face.

First, over the years the face hasn't stayed looking the same and you can see that by looking at the pictures in the article. Mars isn't still it has winds and winter and summer. As said in paragraph ten, ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia."" So, Mars is going to have land differences. Just like we have tectonic plates moving, winds, earthquakes, etc. That changes the surface of the land. So, Mars has the same.

Just like Earth's surface is changing everyday so is Mars.

Then, you can't just look at Mars and see the face immediatly. You have to be standing at the perfect angle. It says in paragraph 7, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Not only did the camera take a better featured picure but they also had to be at a specific angel. As said in paragraph 10, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view."" You have to be in a specific angle to see the ""face."" Just like when things look funny in a specific angle. Like how Italy looks like a boot to some people. So, it wasnt alien made it just has to do with the land moving or wind moving the dust into making it look like a face.

Finally, this has nothing to do with aliens or an ancient civilization doing it. It's just natural landform. Wind probably made this or the change in land but no ancient civilization. NASA only wanted Mars to get a little attention and to show people the wanders of the plant.    ",3,1,0.8027151823043823

The article On the Face on Mars is very interesting, states facts,and some opinions. When the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling then planet Mars it was takikng photographs forl posiible landing sites for Viking 2 spacecraft. But when doing its job itk discovered something unusaul and different about the red planet. What the spacecraft dikscovered that was so

mysterious to NASA scientist was an enormous face structure neaerly two miles from end to end. Many of some people who work for NASA say it was just another Martian mesa that was common on Mars. Could this be a natural landform or a sign form of another life form.

But this stuctuer or landform had Shadows that made it look like an Eygyptian Phharoah. Days later NASA revealed the photograph and the caption read ""huge rock formation...wich resembles a human head...formed by a shwdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Others say that the face was built or made by another life form. But others are wrong, because there are many ways this landform couldve been built by natural land. Many reasons are stated in the article such as if in April it is winter on Mars then themweather couldve formed a natural land stucture. Another reason stated in the artcle by the writer would be the statement of how the face on Mars reminded him of the Middle Bitte in the Snake River Plain. ",2,1,0.8816360831260681

Around the year 2001 the cameras we had used before were developing with technology created with that time period. In 2001 we had taken a picture of the Face to get a clear shot, as you can see in the passage the landform is just like a normal landform here on Earth. The landform was created naturally just like how the Mountains and Naturally made landforms on Earth were. The picture taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 was just a huge misunderstanding to the astronaughts on the shuttle and to the publics eyes.

Many people do not like to hear the truth about something that they thinks is very interesting to them, so they do not believe what others say negative about it.

NASA had sent Mars Global Surveyor to fly or Cydonia

to capture better pictures of the Face. In Unmasking the Face on Mars it states, ""... Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" That means that they had taken a better look at Cydonia and the Face. In Unmasking the Face on Mars it states that, ""Malin's team captures an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Better pictures was a key to inform others that the Face is a landform and not created by aliens.

Have you ever seen a landmark that looks like something else? In 1976 a Mars roover named Viking 1 spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. This just hapened to be huge rocks together looking like a face. NASA named this the ""Face on Mars."" The ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. It has appeared in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! The Face is not a natural landform because it looks exactly like a face, its on Mars which could be an alien, and many roovers have seen the Face when they go to Mars.

The Face is not a natural landform because it looks exactly like a face. How can we not know that it is not an alien. NASA people can't go up to Mars to look at it face-to-face. Roovers can only take pictures of it. Mars is too far away that NASA can't send people up there to make sure it is an alien. There isn't any oxygen up there so people could breathe.

The Face is on Mars, which could be an alien. People have always thought that there were aliens on Mars. This time there actually could be one on Mars. Life on Mars could be a real thing. Mars is a eird place because it is red, unlike Earth which is mostly blue and green.

The Face is a natural landform because NASA has proven that there can't be any life form on Mars. There is nothing that they would be able to eat to stay alive. The planet is red and there isn't any water or anything to drink for them to survive. There is no possible way for any life form to survive on Mars.

There is a natural landform on Mars that looks like a face because huge rocks were fromed together looking like a face. This is all nature, there is no way that aliens could live on this planet. Natural landforms all around the universe. Mountains and hills are all over Earth. Nature takes control of everything that is alive. The Face is a natural landform and not some kind of alien.

The""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform because aliens can't live on a planet without anything to survive, natural ladforms are all over the universe, and the Face is just huge rocks formed together looking like a face. I strongly believe that this is not an alien, and that this is a natural landform.                              ",3,1,0.897130012512207
d61378e,"Since we had sent surveyors to Mars we have found many interesting things. We learned about much of the landscapes there and compared them to what we have here. Like the Earth, Mars also has a mesa biom. The face in the area of Mars know as Cydonia is a mesa biom, so natural formations accur. The face that we have discovered is not an alien structure because almost no true scientists think it is alien, high resolution cameras showed no signs of alien life, and it is natural because it is in a mesa biom.

The first reason that you should not believe that the face is an alien monument is because almost all the scientists agree that it is not a alien structure. As it said in the article, ""Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" They are the ones that truely study this topic and know all about it, so we need to believe them. They also took the picture to draw attention to Mars and how unique it is, not to convince every one that there are aliens. The picture was slightly blurred and showed a unique stucture that was naturaly created.

The second reason is that the first image was burry and did not have the best quality. This could have made it look like it was made by someone or something other than nature. The new images were cearer and prooved that it was natural and that there were no alien artifacts.

The biggest and most obvious reason that should convince everyone is that it is a mesa biom. Things like this form all the time and should not be thought of a being made by anything other than nature. Take Earth for example, we have the same kind of region and it has land forms just as unique and different in their own ways. The formation on Mars was just more unlikely to accur than the other ones. Throughout time things change, and chances are that the Earth has or has had a similar landform that looked like a head.

There is no proof that aliens are on Mars. There is no proof that aliens are real. Nobody will ever be able to prove that aliens created the face because it will change, and eventually will not look like a face anymore. The face on Mars is obviously not an alien relic because almost every scientist agrees, high resolution pictures show it is not alien, and it is a mesa biom so this is natural.",5,1,0.8872195482254028

When the photo they took finally hit the internet it showed nothing but a natural landform and no alien monument.

There is a scientist that I work with that thinks that it was made by aliens, but I don't think so. I don't think so because there has never been any real sightings of aliens and there is not enough research to prove that it was made by aliens. Here's why.

First off, there has never been any sightings of real aliens. People have been trying to see if there are actually is any and other life forms in our solar system. People have claimed that they've seen aliens, but there hasn't been any evidence that makes that true. I think that it is a natural landform because there has been many other objects on other planets that look like they had to be made from aliens, but they soon found out that it was not.

Second, there is really not enough research covering this specific topic. Yes, NASA has taken pictures of it through out many years, but thats all they've done. No human has ever stepped foot on Mars so no one really knows if it is really made by aliens. Though the pictures that NASA took looks like a face and people think thats there's no way a person could do, that makes me beleive that if humans can't do it, then neither could aliens.

First, I'll talk to you about how it is that it got to be like that. Secondly, i will explain how it was made. Lastly, I will show you how and prove to you with facts of how it was proven to not be aliens who built this face on mars.

First, I am positive of what you said about the aliens creating this face and then the government taking them to area 51, is a lie. The alines weren't the ones to create this face because it was what we like to call the mesa or you can also call it the butte. Anyway, the mesa is like a lot of landforms that we have here in western part of America, just as it states in paragrph 12. Secondly, when people started to make assumptions it was because NASA had not been able to take a clear image. So you can not say that it was the aliens because the rest of the world was sayng it. Thirdly, we really couldnt find it whenever we wanted because it was hard to find. As it states in paragraph 9. ''We have to scan the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips'' said Jim Garvin. so this are some small but really to the point facts so you can have and understanding about the face of mars and so you can stop thinking that it was aliens who created this face.

d699778,"As you know, as a scientist we come across many misunderstandings. The ""Face"" on Mars is one of them. This landform was created by natural causes; saying that it was created by a differrent lifeform is irrelavent. It's irrelavent because NASA would have a higher budget than we do now to explore further, if you take a look at the pictures the three are very distinct, and the third photo didn't show any other landforms, pyramids, houses, or lifeforms.

NASA's budget is assgined to them by the new discoveries they find in outter space. If there were alien life on planet Mars we would've told the public, federal government, etc. because we want that extra money to discover more about it. Why would just hold on to that secret. We took a pictures of the landforms lets see how they turned out.

As we compare the pictures of the same landform there are many differences. The 01' picture we took has multiple cracks and craters in the monument. I'm pretty sure the aliens wouldn't bulid a monument some place it could get beat up at. The 76' and 98' pictures were captured with not too good of a camera, causing it to have the appearance of a face.

In 2001, we had created a camera with the highest camera quality we were able to obtain. We researched and studied on the camera itself to see that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of 43 like the other cameras. We came to the conclusion that we would be able to see any other landforms, lifeforms, ships, etc. ,but all of the above are absent.

In conclusion, there was not any life shown on the picture, so it's irrelavent that aliens created it. We visit our monments. Why were there no aliens visiting thiers? One answer, they didn't bulid it.",4,1,0.8098766803741455
d6b6b70,"As a scientist I had to discusss the overall topic about extraterrestrials and the creation of the face on Mars giving the mosts reasonable and lucid -something clearly shown- ideas. There is many reasons why this ""face"" was not made by aliens. As a scientist I had to explain some evidence that would show what this ""face"" is classified as. Also I had to show the main ideaology on these speculations or conspiracies that ""know"" what NASA is doing. My main job as scientist is to observe, study, and explain many mysteries but I had to use clearly expressed qualifications for the face to be created by aliens.

For my first reasoning on this topic I had to discuss this person how this landform is classified as mesa or butte which occurs normally in many environments. Like Garvin said in paragraph 12 in Unmasking the Face of Mars, ""It reminds me most of Midlle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho..."" showing how this type of landform isn't really rare or unique to find. Could this be something created by aliens, too? Well of course not because a mesa can be locationalized in many parts of the hemisphere of Earth around the globe!

After showing the person what this is exactly, I needed to explain how these landforms are ACTUALLY formed. In paragraph 12 of Unmasking the Face on Mars like Garvin said, that the mesa called Middle Buttle in the Snake River on Earth is actually a lava dome that take the form of an insolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Proving that these mesa landforms are not as unique as anyone could think as vividly as possible and are actually formed naturally on Earth. This is acutally scientifically proven by research done over the years on many mesa landforms in Earth.

Another type of reasoning this ""face"" is not made by aliens is proven by photographs tooked by probes above Mars's atmosphere showing clear images of this landform in which gives another reason that this landform is not even a face. First of all this ""face"" was taken by Voyager 1 on 1976 making this photo not revelant for the accusations made by this person. Best of all, the Voyager 1 had a poor quality camera with 43 meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared to the 2001 image tooken by MGS which had 1.56 meter per pixel giving it better quality and rendering of the landform. Also, the more revelant and sufficient evidence contrast to the unrevelant photo for the idea of the ""face,"" shows that the ""face"" is a normal mesa instead of the physical view of a ""face"" on the surface of Mars's rusted iron soil shown by Voyager 1.

Though my reasonings are supported with evidence and proof, the person may accuse me saying that NASA is hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power as said so by many conspiracy theorists. Well I'm not going to lie, defenders of the NASA budget actually WISH there was an ancient civiliztion on Mars. This proves that NASA would show the public, due to the fact that it will help fund NASA with more public support and would make NASA use that money funded for more research and expeditions.

So in conclusion, there are many proven reason why the ""face"" on mars is not made by aliens. Since the mesa landform is not unique and there are plenty here on Earth, since there are also many types of evidence and research done on how these lanforms are made, and since there are also details shown more easily through the revelant photos from MGS showing the ""face"" to be just your average mesa. Also that after all this time, defenders of the NASA budget actually hope for ancient civilization on Mars.",5,1,0.825688362121582

As the show begun the news reporter Ted Cruze asked the question everyone was waiting for, ""Are those pictures from Mars signs that aliens were there and left those misterious faces?"" Everyone was in gradual shock ready to hear the truth.

As Sally started to speak she started off talking about how people may think that aliens were the reasons we found these sightings on Mars. For years that is just what people believe, they think aliens were the reason for those faces but from what NASA has to say about it, all these people are wrong.

Most people don't even believe in aliens but if half of their state or city is saying that of course those people will go with the flow.

So,it shows that it was not created millions of year's ago by some extra-terrestrial bieng(s).Also,when the Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) took the photo in 1976 it looked as if it was just a common landform created by some-type of desert storm,and now that other photos have came in from May 24,2001 from Viking 2 we are shown that it is not a face but a few mesa's(mesa-landforms common around the American west) with shadows on it showing features of a human bieng but are really just hills of sand with weirdly shaped landforms and shadows. Also,on many planets we have seen craters,mountain,and canyons that look like something they're not,and when the shadows are not there you can tell that they are just naturally formed sand hills. Finally,In 1998 the Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) took 10 photos much sharper photos(5 times sharper)than the original Viking 1 did in 1976 and the photos on the (MOC) showed and revealed to be that there was no alien monument or alien worshipping monument just natural landforms.",2,1,0.8126038908958435
d744efa,"Some people may think that the Face is not a natural landform but I am here to give you reasons why the Face IS a natural landform. The reasons I am going to give you are going to be in the paragraphs below, hope you like it and think

''which opinion is better in this essay?''.

The first reason the Face is a natural landform is because 25 years ago something happened on Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship ''Viking 2'', but when the camera spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, then they saw an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a fregion of the Red Planet called '' Cydonia''.

Another reason that the Face is a natural landform is because after a few days , NASA unveiled the image which had shadows forming the illusion of eyes, nose and the mouth. But since it became so popular, the picture has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, etc. They also said that defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. But scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact.

The last reason is that thousands of anxious people were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. But not everyone believed that.

The camera on board MGS had to peer thrrough wispy clouds to see the face, they say perhaps alien markings were hidden by a haze. People are also saying, ''We just dont pass over the face very often''.

But not everyone can be right because some people think its not a natural landform because it could be just a haze from something that was there at that specific moment and time to show that the face was there when it could have really been just a rock and not the Face after all. More reasons to this is that,even though it looked like a face...it couldnt have been, people couldve just seen the face that wasnt really there.

In Conclusion, people have different opinions on what they see and what they dont see in certain pictures. Some people see the face, some people dont see the face at all and that can be a good thing and a bad thing for some people who have different things to say about a certain subject. The Face couldve just been a rock in some peoples opinions, but some people think that it wasnt just a rock, it was an outline of a face.      ",3,1,0.8368725776672363

Anything can pop up out of any type of weathering.There is weather on Mars and the weather there could have made an annoynomous figure that obviously looked like a face. There are many explanitions for what happened such as the picture being tooken of of content.

The picture was tooken not on land, but in the air over clouds and fog. So it could have really been somehing diffeerent under the fog and clouds.

Well on my opinion I don't think the face is a natural landform, in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. If the face has been apart of Mars for ONLY twenty five years I don't think is was apart of martian life, it would've already been discovered a long time ago. I honestly think it has been made up by an illusion.

Stated in paragraph three, NASA uveiled the image for all to see, it was a huge rock formation, which resmebled an humans head making out the shaped of nose, eyes, and mouth. They thought reasoning this situation of Mars would be a great way to grab the public's attention to Mars. It did.

Ever since then it has became an pop icon, so now that i think about it, It does'nt seem like it was apart of martian life. They so far haven't even caught real martian life on planet Mars. So I don't even know how to think that NASA could determine it was apart of alien life on Mars. It possibly could be but I don't think anything could live on the surface of that COLD planet.

It puzzles me that it just randomly popped up out of nowhere and has been located at that very spot for twenty five years, why could this happen now? I don't know maybe later in discovery the scientists of NASA will find out what and why this happened. NASA's budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. I guess we'll have to find out later in the future.

How could they possibly determine it's real? Let's make a couple guesses.

The ""Face on Mars"" has been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, articles, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines! Now you know why people are so amazed of being able to read about this story and give NASA so much feedbacks about this ""Face on Mars"" story.

Another reson is in the text it states on april 8 2001 a cloudless summer day in cydonia mars global surveyor frew close enough for a second look.

First, This natrual landform was not form by alein becuase in the pictures you see a small mountain or big hill , but here in the USA, there are many of thoes big hills or small mountains. They are mostly around the American west. It is a lava dome that are on the USA too. and they are the same height. So that face on that hill is not alone.

Next, Another reason on how that natrual landform is natural not made by aliens is that every time we take a picture over the years the face is always fadeding away so if an alien created it why would he just leave it there just to faded away.

They would of kept it alive.

Last, I can see on how somebody could think this was formed by an alien but how do you explain that the eyes are just shadows. They are formed from the nearby rock. Plus the mouth and nose are also formed by the nearby rock shadow. So the mouth, nose and eyes are not really even there they are just shadows

In conclusion, I am telling the alien face that was on mars was just a lava dome. And its eyes nose mouth were just shadows. Plus the picture just started fading away through the years. This is how the Face was not made by aleins but was a natural landform ",3,1,0.7754780054092407

Buttes or mesas are just land forms common around the Amereican West.

You could actually find the spot that the picture was taken of. The face was found at 41 degrees north martian latitude. It was winter in april of 98 a cloudy time of the year.

From that point forward our quality has got a lot more visible.

I believe the face on Mars is a natural landform, and also there are no aliens up on Mars to make this face.

The face on Mars is a natural landfrom because in paragraph seven in the article states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.

There was no alien monument after all."" That is saying no alien was up there to create the landform. If there was aliens up there NASA would have annouced it. We NASA have taken pictures of Mars and have not seen any aliens upon there.

The face on Mars is made naturaly simple as that I can not get more simple than that.

I a NASA scientist believe that it was made naturaly no figure, no alien was up on Mars physically making faces on Mars. If we were to go up to Mars right now we would not see any alien.

People who think that the face is an alien, they are wrong.

The face on Mars is not an alien because NASA said it was a sort of rock formation. Also that it looked like a human head. NASA never said it looked like an alien or that they had proof of it being an alien. NASA said ""NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth"". NASA also gave proof that the shadows gave an illusion of the rock formation that it looked like a face.

MOC said "" MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos...anxious web sufers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site,revealing...a natural landform.

d9503fa,"The article ""Unmasking the Face of Mars"" talks about a face formation on the planet Mars that people think was a creation made by aliens. Others think the the face is just formation that formed from natural events. Scientists say that the face is just a natural formation and others think that the face is acutally made by aliens. I think that the face on Mars is actually just a natural formation that occured making the face that is shown. Here is why I think that the face is made by natural events.

The face is actually like other buttes or mesas on Earth that are commonly found. According to the article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West."" The face on mars is almost like areas found on Earth making the face seem like it is just a common thing that forms like a butte. Are the buttes or mesas on Earth made by aliens too if the face on Mars was made by aliens? No. The buttes or mesas on Earth are accually formed from natural aspects.

The face could have been formed because of the weather conditions on Mars. According to the article, ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The Camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" The weather conditions on the Red Planet could have been bad on the day that the face was formed. The face could had just been naturally formed because of the weather phenomenon going on in Mars. The planet just could have had bad weather conditions during the time.

When Mars Glodal Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time in 1998, a picture was taken and a natural landformation revealed that there was no alien monument after all. According to the article, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mas Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" That means that the face found on Mars wasn't actually an alien monument. Just a natural landform. When the monument was taken on a sharper picture, the alien monument was actually just a natural formation.

Now you might say that the face found on Mars is accually an alien monument. However, the monument wasn't actually made by aliens, it was made by natural events. According to the article, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. `It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,` says Garvi. `That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the ame height as the Face on Mar.`"" There could have been a volcano that erupted and the lava from it could have hardened forming the face that is on Mars.

In conclusion, th Face on Mars is actually just a natural formation that occured making the face that is shown. The face isn't made from aliens. The face is just a regular formation that occured rom natural events. The face might have been made from aliens according to some people but in reality, the face is made from natural phenomenon.",5,1,0.8446043729782104

Many believe Aliens, but really the face is just a natual landfrom.

To beginning with, there is no physical evdience to back it up. Scientist believed it was just another Martian Mesa. There common around Cydonia, and coencidently this shawdow looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. When NASA soon sent the photo out to the public, the caption wrote ""huge rock fromation ... which reembles a human head."" If NASA believed that it was just a rock formation from the start, then why would it be Aliens once the public seen it?

Secondly,

the image was simply just a illusion. Our minds are able to turn anything we look at into a face, as long as if the items are in correct positon. Have you ever looked at the front of a vehicle and thought it was smiling? That was simply just a illusion. When the huge rock formation was seen, it simply was our mind thinking it looked a face, but it really wasn't.

Lastly, the rumors of it being Aliens did not begin until the photo was realesed to public eye. If NASA did not believe it was aliens then why would we? In that time period, NASA had not found life on mars and still have not. There is no water to show signs of life. When the media saw the photos of course they immediately will say Aliens. NASA simply, wanted peoples attention to go to Mars for funding.

The first clue as to why the Face is just a natural landform is that in April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Mars with Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera. In line seven it states that after the photos were taken and posted online fore people to see, all the pictures revealed was a natural landform with no alien markings what so ever.

Another reason is that on April 8, 2001 NASA had once again sent their mars Global Surveyor up into space to get an even closer look at the face on account so many people didn't believe that it was just a natural landform. The camera that they used to take the pictures with made each pixel in the photos span from 1.56 meters, as said in line ten. Even after they had taken the photos again witha more advanced camera, the images only showed what resembled a butte or mesa, stated in line 12, and once again no evidence of alien markings.

Those are the two reasons as to why the Face is only a natural landform and not an alien monument. NASA has taken pictures of it two times already and even with a more uprgraded camera they still didn't find evidence that aliens ever created it.          ",3,1,0.891712486743927

After studying it, they took a picture of it, and they engaged the public with it.

People started to have debates about the picture and what it could have ment. ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence pof life on Mars."" The others are trying to protect it so NASA could be a little bit safer. The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. NASA said it was a ""huge rock information"" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it. You got to study the artifact before you can assume it is from aliens.

After that, you got to be able to back up your answer , and saying why it is not a face. ""Thousands of anxious web sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform.""

People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars.

d9c0590,"Recently we have discovered a new landform on Mars. Viking 1 caught a picture of a martian mesa, these are very common. These martian mesas are similar to the ones on Earth. They are very common in Cydonia, a region on Mars. Many conspiracy therorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens, but from the evidence we have, this is not true.

The picture taken by Viking 1 showed a large mesa-like landform with the face an Egyptian god on it. Everything can be explained in the picture. The landform is like any other one. The reason it looks like a face is because shadows were being cast onto it to make it appear like it had eyes, a mouth and a nose.

In 1998, a camera captured another picture of the formation. It was a little cloudy on the day they took the picture, so we went again to capture another picture. This time in April of 2001, we used a much better camera and used maximum resolution. This picture was much more detailed and clear. Once we zoomed in it looked like any other landform we might find. In paragraph 11 Garvin states, ¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see them!¨ He was correct this picture proves that there is no alien activity near this landoform.

In conclusion, it is clear that the ¨Face on Mars¨ wasn´t created by aliens. We took a much more defined picture and found nothing. Not to metion the fact that there is no water on Mars, so it can´t support life. Very very few of the scientists beleive that this was created by aliens. Everything can be explained by science in this picture.            ",3,1,0.8446305990219116
d9c3ff1,"The Face from the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" was indeed not created by aliens. Evidence from the photos taken show that the Face was just a rock formation with no artifacts of life around it. The Face was also in an area for formations like that to be common.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens because there is no proof in the pictures that were taken. Pictures were taken in the dates 1976, 1998, and 2001. In each of these three picutres taken there is so definate evidence that the formation was created by aliens. Instead, the pictures show that the formation is common and just happen to look like a face. The text states, ""... Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located... a cloudy time of year on the Red Panet. the comera... had to peer through wispu couds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Based on the information from the text, i can see why people could still believe that the Face was created by aliens. The text goes on to say, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" this statement from the text verifies that any dicrempancies that were argued about earlier, were now out of the argument. Image was to clear to argue about anything. What was seen in the photo was very clear and there were no signs of alien trace.

The Face was in an area that was common for formations like it to be found in. The author states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa- landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle BUtte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava some that takes the form of an isolated mesa avout the same height os the Face on Mars."" Therefore, this gives more evidence on how the Face on Mars was not created by aliens and was a normal formation.

The Face on Mars was a normal formation based on factual ecvidence from scientist. Pictures show that there is no sign of aliens on mars. If there were aliens, the picture would have shown eviidence concluding that the formation was created by aliens. Secondly, the formation was in an area that was common for buttes or mesas. For the reason listed above, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens, however: the Face was a natural landfrom just like we have here on Earth.",5,1,0.9007514715194702
d9e6a88,"Is the face on Mars the face of a new discovery in our universe? When a face was discovered on Mars, the idea of it was quite controversial. Generally speaking, the face on Mars was just a pop icon, not a sign of life. The face on Mars was proven to be a simple landform because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to determine, there were no signs of any civilization, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. The Face on Mars was just a pop icon and a skeptic's thought, not a sign of martian life or civilization.

First of all, in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to find evidence, when all they found was a natural landform.

The Red Planet was very cloudy that time of year, and theorists believed that the haze was hiding any martian evidence or civilization. However, it is not easy to target Cydonia, because of Mars' natural orbit and the fog and haze Mars receives every so often. So, in 2001, NASA sent the Surveyor back up to Mars to take pictures and investigate.

When the photos were taken, the photos were discerned three times bigger than the pixel size, and no signs of civilization appeared. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program states. Each pixel in the image taken was around 2 meters, when the Viking image taken in 1976 had fourty-three meters per pixel. In 1976, the theories could have been believable, considering that the images taken did not show very much evidence if any.

Finally, the American West was compared to Mars when the ""Face"" was labeled as a butte or a mesa. The American West is sultry, gusty, and somewhat similar to what the environment on Mars is. This environment is the perfect environment to form buttes, due to erosion in the soil and the wind pushing the soil around. The landmass on Mars is not exactly a butte, however. This landmass is the Martian equivalent to what the American West has. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" says Garvin.

""There hasn't been enough evidence of the Face on Mars to prove it's only a landmass!"" There has been several images taken of the Face to prove it is a formation. However, the image taken in 2001 is the most accurate, considering that the pixels are about two meters by two meters. That is about 22 times more accurate than the picture taken in 1976, showing about fourty-three meters each pixel of Cydonia. If there were any evidence to show up on the Face, it would be shown in the 2001 image.

The Face on Mars is only a martian mesa, not a pop icon or a civilization. It is an extraterrestrial butte because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to prove, there were no signs of any civilization when images were taken, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. All in all, the Face on Mars wasn't a sign of out-of-this-world autotrophs, but it was just a simple bizarre-shaped butte. The Face on Mars was not only a controversy, but a resolved conflict between conspirors and Cydonia-scholars.",5,1,0.8969182968139648
d9f36b2,"So the face on mars. Many poeple say the face is a alien landmark. Well I dont. Im gonna explain to you why the it isnt. Also that it is just a natural made landform.

What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalnet of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American west. "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the snake river plain of idaho,"" say Garvin. ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars.

So on april 5, 1998, when Mars Globsl Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars oebiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a jpl web site, revealing... an natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

A few days later NASA unvield the image for all to see. the caption noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" This is a great explanation for the way the face looks.

So there you have it. I say that the face is just a natural made landform. There is no evidence to show other wise. With the better camera we were able to find out that its not an alien atrifact. So yes it is not a alien atrifact.       ",2,1,0.8917622566223145
da0a649,"The Face on Mars is one of the most contriversial landforms around. Many people think that it is an artifact that was left behind by past civilizations on Mars. On the other hand, there are people that beleive it is just a mesa, ""landorrms common around the American West."" There are many people in both parties, making for a huge ""debate."" The most logical, however, is that the Face is naturally occuring, due to the evidance that NASA has been able to uncover.

The people that say it is an ancient civilization use illogical evidance for their conclusions, such as, ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" However, the people that believe it is naturally occuring use stable evidance, including, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This evidance shows that the best technology we have shows nothing more than, ""a lava dome that takes the form of and isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Another way to show that the Face on Mars is naturally occuring is the comparison to the lanforms here on Earth, such as the mesa landforms in the American West. In the passage, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist at NASA, working specifically on Mars exploration, is quoted saying,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Garvin, as said before, is a chief scientists at NASA. If he concludes that it is just like a lanform people can see here, than why would anyone be able to argue that?

People strive to find out what is in the unknown. Researchers are some of the people that put their lives into getting the best evidance that they can find about the unknown. The Face on Mars is one example of many projects scientists have put time and effort into. They will always find the best solution or answer to whatever the question may be. Why not trust their conclusions?",4,1,0.8663837909698486
da342ec,"Just A Natural Landform..

The image shown in the capturing photos brought back from Mars revealed something, some call an alien, and others call a natural landform. The image seemed to have caught everyone's attention. As mentioned in the article, it has starred in Hollywood films, magazines, been heard on radio talk shows, and has appeared in books. The images seemed to have reminded people of other natural formations, looking like a natural landform.

Many things like this seem to remind people of other natural formations. Paragraph 12, from the exerpt, states ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Gavin, like many others thought this formation looked like other natural landforms.

The face is just a natural form. Paragraph seven from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" also stated ""There was no alien monument after all."" The same paragraph also included ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing... a natural landform.""

I can see why many people would think the natural formation looked much like an alien because, as included in the exerpt, it looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. However, it looked like it was a huge rock formation with a human head formed by shawdows.

The images captured were just revealing a natural formed, that looked like some other natural forms found all other the world. As stated in the article, ""The face is just a natural form.""     ",3,1,0.7820946574211121
da436e3,"Have we seen any form of life on Mars so far? No, that's why it's clearly a natural landform. Plus, how do the aliens know what we look like. They could look completely different from us. It just so happens that the natural landform look's like a face.

Why would the aliens spend their time making a two mile long face anyways? These natural landform's are common in Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It is indeed interesting and cool to think that it was built by aliens, but it wasn't built by aliens. Don't get me wrong, everyone wishes it was made by aliens, but facts are facts.

In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the landmark and got a couple photo's that are ten times better than the 1976 photo's. It was confirmed that the landmark wasn't a face it was just the shadow's that made it look like a face. But of course, skeptics thought the alien markings were hidden by haze. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work.""(Paragraph 9)

Then, on April 8, 2001, four years after the last photo, another couple of photo's were taken. These photo's were way clearer than the photo's from 1998. "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" Garvin added. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This is proof that aliens did not make this landform.

As you can see, there is plenty of edvidence that the two mile head is a natural landform. Their is way more convicing stories about this topic. But I hope that my side of the argument conviced you that the landform wasn't built by aliens.         ",3,1,0.8752827644348145
da5a8fd,"I know you might think that the face on Mars was created by aliens, but here at NASA we have been doing reasearch for many years to find any signs of life on other plants, and so far we have nothing. The face on Mars might look like it was created by aliens, but our reasearch shows that it is just shadows. Also because we have been doing reaserch for so long all of our studies show that there is no possible way that any creature would be able to survive on any other planet in our solar system other then Earth. Also as it said in our reserch it is just a rock formation that happened because of soemthing like a landslide.

When all of us here at Nasa first saw the image we knew we had to study it! When we beagan our studies we sent a space craft up to take pictures. When we recived those pictures we noticed that it looked like it was a shadow of the way we were taking the picture or maybe the way that rocks were laying. We were all still curious on how the rocks got there so we kept studying!

At NASA there is always reaserch of something going on! When we first started reaserch one of our main goals was to figure out if there is any possible way that people could live on any other planet then Earth. So far we have concluded that there is no possible way that anyone could survive on any other planent, because there is no suply of food or water. So with our prior knoladge of that we knew that there were no aliens on any planets!

Even though we knew all these things we still wanted to know more so we continued our reasearch. While contuning our reaserch we found out that it was highliy possible that there was something like a landslide on Mars. With our knoladge of landslides we knew that they can sometimes form things like rock scopluters that look like things they are something they are not. So with all of our reaserch we all came to a conclusion.

All of us at NASA were very sure with our conclusion of this was not created by aliens that it was just something as simple as a land slide and shadows. Throughout our reasearch we found out that the reason the rocks look like a face is shadows, and that the rocks got there from something like a landslide.

da81c33,"The face on Mars is just a natural landform because it states in the text that the only reason the rock looks like a face is because it has shadows from the sun, and in this case the shadows give the ""face"" eyes, mouth, and a nose.

Yes even though there have sightings of UFO's or ( Unidentified Flying Object) the conspiracy theorists say that this face is an alien artifact but it states that the only reason why they say it is a feace is so more people are attracted to Mars.

The landform int a real face because if you compare the ""face"" to an Earth rock in that shape they would look the same, until you add some light from the sun causing shadows, and it would include the facial parts of any human man or woman.

As you see from paragraph 3 you will see that it states in the last sentence "" The author's reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Although, it did the scientist thought that tehy have accomplished something huge by tricking people into thinking it was a huge head.

It became a pop icon and starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows. Everyone believed this was evidence for life on Mars. But that was shut down after another picture was taken of the Face that didn't quite look like a face at all.

On April 5, 1998 Michael Maling and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a trip to Cydonia for the first time. There, they were able to snap a more clear and sharper picture of the Face than the original photos. After looking at it, the picture didn't show a face. It just showed a natural landform.

Although, the picture was proof that it was just a normal landform, not everyone was satisified. The Face on Mars is found at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet and the camera used to take the photo had to peer through the clouds to view the Face. Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the haze of the clouds.

The mission controllers were prepared for a second look. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless day in Cydonia, the Mars Global Surveyor went to find the Face. What the picture showed was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which are landforms common in the American West.

In conclusion, the Face was not made by aliens. The Face has nothing to do with aliens and wasn't made or created by them. The Face isn't The sharper pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 show proof that the Face is actually just a natural landform.      ",4,1,0.8480209112167358

A NASA sacecraft called the Viking 1 took pictures of a face on mars. The face on mars could be real but it is not. The face is just a natural landform with a shadow. The shadow is giving the illusion of a face. The shadow is giving the illusion of the rock having a nose, mouth, and eyes. Therefore none of that is actually there it is just a figment of someones imagination and an illusion.

Since then nasa has been doing more and more research on this strange object on mars. We took a clear photo of the object and it appeard to be a face, looking straight at our spacecraft.

Scientists figured that the face had unusual shadows that made it look, like an Egyption pharaoh. A few days later NASA wanted to unveil the image for the whole world to see, they exlained the face of mars on movies, tv shows, magazines, and radio talk shows. People thought that the foce of mars was created by an alien space craft or an alien ship has crash land on to, mars to make ith look like a face.

This has been solved to be just a landform, but some people still believe that the ""face"", was created by aliens. Here are some facts to prove that this is a natural landform.

First of, in 1976, pictures were not the best back then. We were still working on them to make the outcome look better. With the digital images being 3 times bigger than the pixals, you are bound to find something that is not what it seems to be. Also, the ""face"" is located 41 degrees north martian laditude. This is a more foggy area of the planet. This could explain why the picture looks like a ""face"". Also, there were other objects around the ""face"" that casted shadows on the landform, making it look like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. This landform is very similer to landforms in the West of the U.S. This would be called a mesa. Finally, the scans of the ""face"" can only go so far. Plus, the camera doesn't go over the face often either.

Even since cameras have been upgraded for a better picture, NASA can prove that this is not an alien made ""face"", but a natural landform on Mars. ",3,1,0.8792351484298706

It became popular after the scientists and researchers found out about it. It went on tv shows, movies, magazines, and stuff like that.

Some scientist think that it was some kind of alien artifact, even though aliens do not exist. Some of the scientists or the Mars Orbiter Camera took a lot of pictures to get a really good picture of it. The scientists did this because they wanted to be able to study a lot better and they would get a better view of the face, if they get a really good picture of it. It took a while for them to get the picture on this JPL web site. It turns out that the face was not an alien's artifact after all.

The scientists wanted to get another picture of the face on Mars. They wanted to have a second look at it, to make sure that can get the right information on it. Like where the face is, what degrees it is at, which it is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. They wanted to find good information about it. They wanted to get better pictures of it so they could study it more, so they could get research on it.

Some people think that the face on Mars looks equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform commom around the American West. So now people know what it looks like. Some people might think it still looks like a face to them but other people might not think that anymore. They think it looks different now that the scientists figured out what it looks like. The scientists figured out that the lava dome, isolated the form mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The scientists might still be trying to figure out how this face appeared on Mars how it got there.

When we sent the photos out to the public , we knew it would be a popular decisions in the media. Yes, people are aloud to have an opinion on this topic. The public just took the pictures the wrong way.

One, yes the landform does look like a face like design but people don't think of the shadows

any affect of how the pictures can look as. Let take the Mona Lisa, to make her a relistic, Leorado used shades and shadows to make her look like person. When people see face like things, they start to form a face. Well, since our anccients used that for surival. Two, people think of the Face like

the

Spinx in Egpyt and how ""alien"" built that momuent.

Some people don't think about how the moon has landforms , but that doesn't mean life lives on the Moon. Since the Moon has crater, but still there is no life on it. On Mars, there is not a lot of oxygen or water to support a species. Yes, people can say that they can require different natural rescources, but would they really?

The landforms can form on planet without living like mountains, craters, and cliffs.

I think that people overlooked this landform and made it more than it really is.The Face was just meant to be a picture that can show the beauty of Mars. NASA

likes that the public is

supporting

our studies of Mars and still wants the support to continue. Life on Mar is a case we can close.",3,1,0.8462083339691162
db6a373,"The Face On Mars. A wonderful bit of scientific information that has become yet another pop icon. Many do believe that it is proof that there is life on Mars or on other planets. But even though we too would like to believe in such an existence, it is not true. This ""Face On Mars"" is just a natural landform that has the resemblence to a human profile.

The reason is that the face is just another landform. It seems like this has been repeated a multitude of different times, but lets look at the facts. We all know of certain landmarks or features that you find as you drive across the countryside and think, ""That looks like my dog!"" as you drive by a stone. That stone that you thought resembled your dog was just created by weathering and erosion. Why would this be any different than that? In the article, a man called Garvin talks about this by giving some different examples. He says that the face is actually, ""The Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" Many things can be created to look like amazing things using wearthering and erosion.

Next, the weather. In the article, it said that on the first time that any human made device was able to take a picture of this it was apparently hazey out which made the picture look a lot different than what it looked like the second time. The second time that they took the picture, it came back just another landmark.

Finally, the people behind it. What I can alos say, is the human imagination. The human imagination is a place where everyone frequents and dreams up everything and anything. This is whats happening here. What is happening is people, scientists and conspiracy theorists alike. People want to and believe that there is another life form out there somewhere. This can lead to false information, accusations, rants, and many other things that can be put to a theorist. As much as we would like to believe it, we can't. Mainly because we don't have the cold hard facts to put it with. So as long as we don't have the information or evidence to put with it, we can't know anything for certain.

There you have it. Say what you will. The face is real. The aliens just moved it some place else. Your not looking in the right spots. Your keeping valuable information from us. The government is after us. The space aliens are real. The weather was just bad, thats all! You need to update your camaras adn equipment.

This face has been causeing a big argument about life on mars and that alien made the face but im here to prove it wrong. This argument is just crazy alien life haha impossible and im here to tell you why their no alien life on mars and that just a rock formation. Now here are my three facts that will surely bring you to resaon noththing but shadows, no aliens found, all clear these will prove im right

The rock fomation know as the face on mars is nothing its just shadow turning the rock to a face when you look or take a photo from far away. This face is just a rock the only reason its look like a face because of shadows from far away the may seem like a face because the shadow give features like eyes, noes, and a mouth. This would maake any one that not looking very close think it looks like a face

On april,5,1998 michael malin and the mars ordbiter camera went to to cydoia to slove this problem once and for all. When he arrived he took the camera and document his time their makeing sure he got pictures of everywhere he went. when he csme back they took the photos and reseach them and found no traces of alien life forms. With this info they were able to show to the media that their aliens makeing rock faces on mars.

It was about about a couple mouths untill the media wanted more info to really prove that it was just a rock formation. So NASA inhase their ordbiter camera and took it back to cydoia. as they took more pictures with a better camera with maximum resoluiton to get a better shot of the planet they can fanliiy prove 100% that their are no alien or sturuces on mars

With this NASA was able to prove it's just rock formation like any rock formation on earth. Now i hope you can understand why its just that a bunch of rocks that was given human features because of the shadows. that not only once but twice they took pictures showing that their are no aliens on mars or anywhere. Hopefully you could really see why and still say they could have miss it you are sadly mistaken they gave a clean sweep around the plant showing no structes or life forms",4,1,0.8387193083763123

There is no proof for any of the rumors.

People have had clues about them.

Some say that it looks like an Egypitan Pharaoph, others say it looks like a river from Idaho.

The face has become so popular that it was starred in movies, magazines, books and talk shows.

It was so popular because it was unusual.

NASA knew once they showed the public the picture they would attract more attention to the planet Mars.

The Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia and took a picture that came out more clear than the first picture that NASA took.

To get the picture was hard work.

They usually do not pass over Cydonia very often.

There is a spacecraft that will fly over the location and scan it like a fax machine.

The picture of the face may mean different things to people and some may have different opinions about it.

One person said it looked like a mesa formed by lava.

If NASA done more research about the face in Cydonia they might be able to figure out what it is and what caused it.

Unitl someone says what it really is, it will just be a big mystery.

You can spot the head shaped figure from two miles away.

Photographing the landform became important to NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor.

They also felt that it was important for taxpayers.

No matter how cloudy or hard it was to see and capture the face, they still made it work.

The crew in the Mars Global Surveyor said there were alien markings that were hidden.

When Malin's team tried again to find another photo they went on a cloudless day and used the maximum resolution and got another picture.

When they used the maximum resolution you could see things that were even on the ground such as planes or pyramids.

They also stated that the landform was almost the same as a butte.

dba96f3,"Hello my name is Ben I am a scientist at NASA, I have been discussing the face on mars with someone who believes it was created by aliens. I have read the Article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", and I have gathered some information and in my opinion I think the face was created by natural causes and is a natural landform. Here are some of my reasons.

My first reason why i think it is a natural land form is because as stated in paragraph three of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" ""huge rock formatiom . . . which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.'' By saying this they say that the face is meerly an angle with odd shadows making the illusion of a human face.

My second reason is in paragraph 5 which states ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" By saying that the conspiracy theorists are completely controdicted and the NASA supporters are agreeing with them and saying yeah it would be good if there were actuallty life on mars and making it possative on their part.

My third reason is in Paragraph 7 which states that ""Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time."" The team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. And the photos revealed a natural land form, and there was no alien monument after all. This shows that at the time the lack of high-tech cameras and technology made the landform resemble a human face. But not everyone was satisfied.

Some may argue and say ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. But NASA went back and took another look at Cydonia on a ""cloudless summer day"" with their absolute maximum resolution camera and captured an extraordinary photo. But the photo contained no alien life forms as stated in paragraph 11 ""So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion the face on mars is really just a natural landform, and stated in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa--landforms common around the American West."" ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" said Garvin. Those are all of the reasons why i think the ""Face on Mars"" is actually just a natural landform.",4,1,0.8771191835403442
dbbaa3b,"One of the highest paying movie catagories is Science fiction, but it's just that fiction, it's fake. When you watch these movies about aliens you can never take them as one hundred percent fact. The CGI can look amazing and the props outstanding, but it's not real. Now NASA has photographed an image of what liiks like a face created by aliens, but that is not a face, and it can be proven with facts.

There is a point in the article that says, it was just a messa, only this one had unusall shadows. That right there tells us that it is not anything created by aliens, but in fact just something that we even have on earth, the only difrence is that mars had lots of cloudes, wich gave it shadows, wich made the rock look like a face. The face on mars is just another hoax, another what if statment, another theroy, one that has been disproved by evidence. MYTH BUSTED. Now of course scientest didn't stop there, and they kept researching the face, trying to prove that it's alien, but they never did, because it's not alien, just another rock.

Aliens have been part of our world for a long time now, but the aliens we have grown acustom too are fake, just coustumes. That is one of the reasons they have become so famous, because they're not real. yoou cant take everything you see in movies or on tv as one hundred percent fact, you need to know whare fake ends and relaty begins. The famous Face on Mars, is not created by aliens, but by clouds. ",2,1,0.7969608902931213
dbcb8e2,"There are a variety of perspectives and opinions related to the Face on Mars. Many say that it's simply a lava dome, or that it could just be a strange rock molded in such a way where it may appear to be a face. However one of the most popular arguments is that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Although this is a very well-known opinion, it is false.

This is not the first time that such a conspiracy has been made in different cases, therefore something like this isn't as frazzling to the experts. On May 24, 2001 when sight of the Face on Mars was first made the scientists at NASA simply thought it to be another Martian Messa which was not the first sight of it making this something not taken to drastic measures. They thought of many different possibilities to why this was formed in a way that reminded us of an Egyptian Pharaoh such as the possibility of the camera's angle, the shadows covering it. Basically we thought of everything minus the chance that it may have been the works of such ""aliens"".

Aliens have been the illogical reasoning to many things we find on the various assortments of planets so hearing that this recent discovery was blamed on aliens isn't very shocking. We spent a few days deciding whether or not to show the images captured to the public, but in the end we decided to do so. The Face on Mars instantly became a well-known subject all over the world things such as movies, magazines, and even radio and tv talk shows all spoke of the mysterious Face on Mars. Many considered this discovery as the new pop icon. During this there were many conspiracy theorists who began to state that the Face on Mars was the work of aliens. However that's the thing, there are no statistical facts simply a load of different conspiracies made from people who strongly believe in such things! Considering there is lack of proof on even the stance that aliens are real the ""case"" was never thoroughly thought through.

There can be various reasonings and opinions about the Face on Mars and though they may be very amusing or interesting to hear, the reality of it is really that it is simply an isolated lava dome. This isn't the first time that natural landforms have represented such things as faces or even common artifacts. There is still research going on about what's casuing these strange formations, but you can be sure that it's not the work of aliens.",3,1,0.8827125430107117
dbcfa50,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", there is information showing that the Face is a natural landform, and was not created by aliens. I have to agree, and say that the Face is a natural landform. Reasons to back up my thought would include, that the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures showing that it wasn't a real face, they have never seen anything like this before, and more scientists believed it was a rock formation rather than an alien.

The Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures to get closer looks on the formation, to see if it could be a real face or not. In paragraph 7 it stated, ""...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Malin and his team took sharper pictures to prove to other people that they were right about it being a natural landform. Scientists also haven't seen anything like this before. In paragraph 9 it mentioned, ""We just dont pass over the Face very often."" If it really was an alien you would see more things like this because there wouldn't be just one alien, there would way more, causing there to be more faces. More scientists also believed that the Face was a natural landform, while only a few believed it could have been an alien feature. Within paragraph 8 it stated, ""But not everyone was satisfied... Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" By the article saying this, they showed that some people disagreed with the other scientists, and actually thought it was some sort of alien marking.

Although, most of the scientists say that this is a natural landform, there will always be someone who wants to disagree with them. No matter how many people would say that something is right, there will always be that one person who has to be different then everyone else. In the article, there are more facts saying that the rock is a natural landform, even though that leading it to be bias. There would be a better argument, if you had one story saying it was natural, and one story saying it's because of an alien. ",3,1,0.9048318266868591
dbd027f,"To prove to my fellow collegues about the ""Face on Mars"" thing was naturally made, not by alien lifeforms, i have decided to write this paper. This face has shodows and yes it does make it look like it has eyes, nose, and mouth, but that just really what we want to see if you were told it was a face you would've beleived it.

The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" has a lot of suspense and it does indeed pull the reader in, and towards the end they break down the scientific facts. They use examples of here on earth and they talk about the showdows. They even talk about how the resolution of photos could change the perspective of those photos.

This face shaped mound on mars has just thrown all the theories out and has caused a big worry in the world. Personally I did not see the face until i had read through the article pretty much pin-pointing all of the features, so i went back to the picture of the face and that when i did see it. One persons theory has caused problems for everything from t. v. to conversations.

The fact of the matter is that when you look at this mound and you are told its a face you are most likely gonna beleive that concept until you get the scientific facts and you read them and you probably still wont beleive it, because as humans there has always got to be something that drives you to be excited. Its in our genetics and our concept is just going to be stuck with until there is an actual reasoning that can be proven.

In this paper i have mostly talked about my beleifs, but everyone has their own beleifs and I know that we can not fully prove there is life on other planets, but whatever makes you strive fo answers be my guest. I am not here to judge you or shoot down your answers. I am here to give you once again another concept.",2,1,0.8524861335754395
dbd15ac,"Well what do you think? Aliens on Mars are as likey as th moon being made out of cheese meaning, that is not possible. The idea of of that can be struct down by facts. It is simply a natural landform because it looks to much like a human face and if aliens made it how would they know what we look like. Also, there are no signs of life on the planet, and lastly it is just a bunch of creators on a mountian.

Lets look at some of the facts, while there is possible life on there it looks to much like a human face. If this was proof of aliens how would they know what we look like. It would have to many similarities to us. If it were an alien structure, they would have to be here living among us and they would stick out a little bit.

Another fact to shutdown the theory is Mars is not inhabitable. While still being about the same size of Earth, it is not possible to live on it. Mars is not able to produce oxegen because it does not have any trees, and while you would probably say aliens woud not needed oxegen, but I say every living thing needs oxegen.

Lasty, when you first look at it can be hard to see it is just a mountain. When you look at it, it does look it has a mouth, nose, eyes, and freckles. Though when you look at it closely, you can see the freckles are just creators. The mouth it is simply a dips between two mountains, the eyes are also just large creators. Also when you look at the nose, you can see an extention of one of the mountains.

It can be hard to see the diffrences and think t is an actual face, with fact that is not possible for it to be a sign of alien life. It can not be a sign f aliens on Mars beccause, it looks to much like a human face, The planet is inhabitable, and it is just creators on a mountain. ",3,1,0.7749790549278259

dbf00cf,"The face on Mars could never be created by aliens if it had then NASA would

have seen an alien by now this proves that the face had to be a natural cause. Jim Garvin head cheif of science for NASA Mars Exploration Program explained that even he thought it was a natural cause like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

The landform he is talking about is a lava dome that is an isolated mesa that has about the same length as the Face on Mars. Jim and his workers have made some success in getting some good photos the first time they tried it, it was winter time on Earth so Mars had been covered with wispy clouds that covered some of the face up. The scientists have worked hard but stopped taking photos after two years on April 8, 200l it was summer time so Mars had been the clearest it could have been.

They took the photos with a camera of absolute maximum resolution the pixels comparedto the 43 meters in 1976, they were 1.56 meters in 2001. The truth is, is that the Face on Mars is a natural cause on April 5,1998 was the first photos that the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Michael Malin's team took photos ten times sharper then the original Viking photos to prove a natural cause. From 1976 to 2001 the new photos prove with the help of there new 3D altimetry NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft revealed the Face on Mars was really a mesa.",2,1,0.8577730655670166
dc22ef5,"It is not a face. As you can tell in the picture, it clearly resembles a face, but there are a lot of facts to show that it is not. First, they have updated images showing it is a rock formation, just like here on Earth. Second, if it could prove aliens once lived, or currently live on Mars, then NASA would not hesitate to publish it. The Mars face is only a natural rock formation.

There are newer images proving it is a rock. With our growing technology we sent spacecrafts close to Cydonia, and they show rock formations. This rock formation is much like what we have on Earth. The shadows cast upon the rock, giving it facial features. On a different day, those shadows are not there.

Why would NASA keep this a secret? NASA would thrive from finding alien lifeforms. Why would they keep that private. As the story states, "" Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" They want that, because their budget would increase and they could do better projects if they had published it.

Nerws articles claimed it was a rock formation long before any conspiracy theories were out. Soon, after the second shot of it, scientists proved it was just another rock formation that resembles many we have here on Earth today.

Even though the photos look like they have facial features, and could be the remains of an ancient alien civilization, it is not. Some facts to back it up are that NASA would not hide something this benefitual to them from the public, scientists have proven it was made naturally by rock, and better resolution photos prove that it is just a rock formation with shadows showing facial features. In Mars' revolution the sun does not always cast a shadow on it, and that is why the features do not always show up, proving that the Mars face is just another face in conspiracy history.",4,1,0.8768498301506042
dc3add1,"Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens?

How can you believe that the face on Mars was aliens? it is obviously just another landform of Mars'. Here, i'll go through some evidence that it is just a landform.

First of all, landforms like that are common in Cydonia. Also, keep in mind that appearances can be decieving. You can even see a similar landform right by the ""face"". And plus, there is no scientific evidence of life on another planet, let alone Mars. Simply stating that a haze could've hid the ""alien"" markings is hardly a compelling argument.

Second off, The photo they took in 2001 proves even further that it just a normal martian messa. and accourding to the article that have read, ""you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" if you want to check this article out, you can find that information in paragraph 11. so if there were any alien objects, you could both see what they were and even know what they were.

I think i have proven my point. so don't even try to argue that, you will not succeed. i know that you might say, well NASA is just lying. My response is that if you had the money to afford a satellite and you sent there, with the current high grade cameras, you would find that you were wrong all along. so yes I win this argument, and that the ""face"" on Mars is just a messa.",3,1,0.85218745470047
dc5e967,"Yes, many people do think that the ""Face on Mars"" was a monument created by aliens, possibly creating a sign of some sort. However, this is not true. What you think is the ""face"" is actually a natural landform. This natural landform may appear to look like a face, but why?

The landform looks like a face becuase of the shadows that hit the landform in certain areas. ""... this... had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (2)."" It makes it look somewhat like a face. ""...a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth (3)."" Another reason why the landform looks like a face is becuase our eyes, that play tricks on us, may make it seem real that it is a face. Such as illusion that make it appear that the landform looks like a face that is staring up at the camera on Mars. Many poeple, however will still ask for more evidence that the landform is not alien artifact.

""...Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origional... photos... when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no monument at all (7)."" ""What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West... That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12)."" So the landforms that you are seeing are actually common along the American West. They don't just pop up out of nowhere. They have been seen before. It's not like it is a first thing that scientists are just discovering.

This evidence proves that there is no alien monument on Mars, it may appear to look like it. But scientists have proved that it is only a natural landform, created naturally, on Mars. Not an alien monument that was created as a sign by aliens on Mars.",3,1,0.9239927530288696
dc76991,"The face that was found on Mars may be made by natural causes. There are many reasons why this odd shaped figure would be made by natural causes, like gust of wind throwing rocks around could make that human like face. Or something that can pick up big boulders and can move them into place. There are many reasons why this face showed up, but aliens are not one of them.

What might have caused rocks to move into place to create this human like face is large gust of wind. Or something that is really strong. Or it could have been a big pile of rock and just formed over the years into a face. In the story ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", there is more then one lump of rock there is two. The second is just not shaped like a face. There are spots everywhere on this planet with lumps of rock. Most of them are formed by erosion. Erosion is the process of being broken down. There could be parts of the lump of rock that wasn't strong enough to hold it's self up. They may have fell in to make the eye shape. The nose could have been another small pile of rock that made it look like a nose. This is from up high it may look different down low. It may look like a big piece of rock. There are different views or angles you can look at it.

Other people may think that aliens did this. But there was no traces or marks left behind that can detect an alien. In the story it says, ""There was no alien monument after all."" Now in the story it says that all the traces of the alien that did this were covered in haze. In paragraph 12 it says, ""

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.""

They strongly agree that this is just natural causes. Now they are probably still doing some testing or research about this face. But they strongly agree that it is just a natural cause. Formed by erosion,or gust of winds,or even soft spots.

They shape is another crazy thing added on the list of things that NASA sees on different planets. This is just another figure made by the planets natural causes.

dc81c67,Natrual land forms are all over earth some looking like common things or objects they of course happen natrualy. So that means other planets have natrual landforms that look like a thing or object such as a face. Nasa has taken scans and pictures using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Meaning they have gotten a full survey of the whole area looking if there was any sign of life that could have created the Mars face. But none were found meaning there is no alien civilization on Mars. It doesn't have to be created by aliens and it probably wasn't but its not wrong to imagine how it was created. But to just know the truth that it is a natrual landform intead of an alien monument. If it was an old alien monument Nasa wouldn't try to cover it up. They would be trying to get funds for taking more trips to actually find more stuff about the mars face instead of taking differnt scans and pictures.

dc91256,"As a NASA scientist, I believe that the face on Mars was formed by aliens. Me as well as other scientists believe this because, we still don't know for sure that there's any life on Mars. As well of the fact that a face can't be made randomly on a planet, there had to be something that made it. When you think about it you see nothing Earth or human like on any other planet.

Well we still don't know for sure if there is any other planet with a sign from aliens but, every planet has a special feature to it. For instance Earth has weather elements such as;rain, snow, hail, and mist. Mecury is the nearest to the sun. Venus is made mostly out of gas. And Saturn as well as Uranus has rings. Neptune is the cold icy planet. Then Jupiter is the biggest planet.

Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artcraft, photograpghing Cldonia became a prority for NASA when Mars Global Surbeyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking mission ended.

dc978d4,"About 25 years ago, NASA saw a ""face"" like figure on Mars. It was obvious that it was a large rock formation with shadow-like features. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and it caught a picture ten times sharper than the first. It revealed a natural landfom. But, because this was taken a cloudy day people believed it was an alien haze. Therefore on April 8, 2001, they took another picture on a cloudless day in Cydonia.

The spacecraft took a picture on m aximum resolution, which was far batter and clearer than the 1976 Viking photo. If any pyramids, shacks, or lifeforms were there we would have seen it, that's how pixelated the camera was. The photo shows that the ""face"" is the Martian equivalent to a mesa or butte rock formation. They compared it to the one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Also, hollywood films, magazines, and radio talk shows aren't always reliable. Why would you believe a story based on something, with no actual facts to back it up? The actual pictures and evidence are a more reliable source rather than conspiracy theories, movies, or magazine articles. People have too much trust i the media that they don't rely on facts from NASA or other imporatnt officials anymore. After the clearer pictures were released people continued to believe there was aliens, or that NASA was hiding something. The pictures, facts, and even the example of the Idaho mesa give more proven details on this particular subject of the ""face""

In conclusion, I believe the ""face"" on Mars is simply a mesa or rock formation, because rock formations aren't uncommon on this planet and they have more evidence to prove it such as pictures, examples of mesas, and basic information. Those who believe the conspiracy theories, or in aliens do not have enough information to back up their story. Therefore, the ""face"" is only a mesa.",3,1,0.83482426404953
dc9c919,"It is a landform not a Civilization!

In the atricle NASA has comfirmed that the ''Face on Mars'' was just an landform also called a Martian mesa. The image was found in area in mars that is called Cydonia. The shaped like face looked like a real human face, but it was just shaped that way. Others think that it is a ancient alien civilization that used to be on mars but now there is nothing on mars and it seems like the Alien civilizaton has left things behind when they disappered.

When NASA first saw the face they didn't know what to belive so they too pictures in 1976,1998, and 2001.

Why it is a landform and that it is not a alien civilization because Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera crew snapped a photo

of the face ten times. Web surfers were waiting for results and it came out as a landform so there for it was never a alien artifact.

Reasons why people would think that the face could have been a face from a alien civilzaion because the face really looked like a actually face and that it could have been from an acually civilization. Some people believe that we are not the only ones in the universe and some other people think that we are the only ones in the universe and when this these images was sent it made people believe at the time that when there was no answer to what the face ment to people.

But when NASA comfirmed that the image was just a landform people most likely still believed that it is still an alien civlization because to some people they ask where did the artifact get there? Is there any other artifacts that are on mars or in another area? After movies, blogs, and books lots are considering these things and some people might be afraid of what else might be out there. NASA might be trying to answer some of these questions but for right now it is just a landform.

NASA has found more space like things that couldn't have been explained but maybe in the future they could find more things on mars than just a landform or try to find more things on other planets than mars.

Another reason why you should believe that the face on Mars is real is because the Jet Propulsion Lab saw the face on their motor. The said it looked like an Egyptian Pharoah.

NASA unveiled the image for people to see. The people were fascinated. That's when they really thought it was a natural landform. When they looked at it, they saw a human head. It was the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

People said that the photo was cloudy so then they went out again in 2001 and the pixels are much better. They went out again and it was not cloudy either. It was clear that the photo was a landform.

dccfda3,"I have to admit, the Face is a really cool thing, but it being made by aliens, come on! It is highly unlikable and unreasonable. The face is a landform that has always been there. There are many factors that go into why the Face could not have been created by aliens.

First and foremost, conspiracy theorists have no proof that NASA is hiding that their was even an ancient civilization on Mars. In paragraph five, there was a quote that said, ""... defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" There basically saying that an ancient civilation would have benefited NASA, if they had actually found one. If there was an ancient civilization people would have found out about it already.

In paragraph seven, on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and Michael Malin, with his Mars Orbiter Camera, took pictures of the the original Vikings photo that were ten times sharper. The new photos revealed a natural landform. The camera quality was poor in the original photo in 1976. That explains why the landform appeared to look like a face. As time past and technology improved, NASA was able to make out that the face was an illusion from bad camera quality.

Going along with the previous paragraph, people believe that the cause for the landform in the photo, in 1998, to not have a face is because of aliens! In paragraph eight, the camera, that they used to take the photo with, had to peer through clouds to see the Face. People believed that the clouds were created by aliens so that they could hide the Face. I do admit that clouds could have affected the photo, but they were clearly wrong. In the ninth paragraph, on April 8, 2001, The Mars Global Surveyor took another photo in the camera's highest resolution on a cloudless day, and once agian, the picture revealed a natural landform.

With most of the information in the article, I can conclude that the Face was just a picture that created controversy because of its uniqueness. I mean, it was a face on Mars! It was taken a long time, with poor camera quality, causing the landform to look like a face.

While this is a very popular opnion that appears through out the media, such as books, magazines, and talk shows, it doesen't seem to have the scientific proof the back it up. The Cydonia mesa was created though natural means and there were cerntainly no aliens involved.

Some people might say that NASA would want to cover the mesa up if it was created by aliens, which make no economic sense. If extra-terrestrial life was found, NASA would get sizeable grants from the goverment to continue with the space exploration program. NASA decribed this as a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth"". There was no mention of aliens.

Many imaging devices were sent to find out wether the Cydonia mesa was in fact an alien artifact. Their names were the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Orbiter Camrea, each one better than the last. Better camreas, better crews, and everyone was trying to figure out this strange land mass. This was hard, because it takes a long time to line up a camera perfectly with an orbiting, spinning planet.

Finally on April 5th of 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the mesa and snapped a picture. No aliens to be seen anywhere. Still, people weren't satisfied. They protesteted that the picture was taken in cloudly weather and thats why there were no extra-terrestials.

On April 8th of 2001, a cloudless, summer day, they flew over again and snapped a picture. In this picture it was crystal clear it was just a mesa. There were no signs of alien life and nobody was able to dispute it.

There was not one thing on that planet that even remotly pointed to the idea of extra-terrestrials on Mars. Even if there was, NASA would report it as soon as possible for financial gain. The money they would get to keep looking would be sizeable. So they decided to look, and they sent up many camreas to get photos. All those photos proved one thing. The Cydonia mesa was created though natural means and there were cerntainly no aliens involved.",4,1,0.7538416385650635

When the photographers took a picture of it, it was as soon as possible. Plus the camera was at its absolute maximum and so u can obviously tell it is a shadow that makes a face. What the picture really shows is the Maritan the same as a butte or mesa land form which is common around the American West. If there were a peron on Cydonia we would be rich finding the greatest discovery of all time. why not have more then just a man lets have a whole colony right?

When Michael Malin flew over it the team got a picture Ten times sharper then the first picture and when people on the internet who just couldnt wait to see what it was guess what they found out it was?

dd3e34b,"Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars.

NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.

They call it ""The Face.""

The Face is very interesting.

Many people could have different opinions about how the Face could have gotten on Mars or how it was made.

Your opinion could be that either aliens created the Face or it is just a natural landform, but you would need to have reasons to back up why you believe so.

Aliens have been believed to be real, but others do not think so.

There is no real proof yet, but many scientists and other people are still trying to find clues and details about aliens on other planets.

This leads some to believe that if aliens are real, that they could have created the Face.

How could aliens create something as complex and interesting as the Face?

Aliens could not be that smart.

To think about it being a natural landform, it is pretty complex, but it may just be the way that we are looking at it and are seeing it.

The way we see the Face all depends on the way you are looking at it.

Scientists have named it ""The Face"" because that is what it looks like, but maybe if someone else looks at it, they would not even see ""The Face"" at all.

They may see something completely different.

If you think that aliens created ""The Face"" first see if there is anything else that aliens may have been thought to create or where they came from.

If there is no proof to aliens, then how could they have created something?

And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West.

It almost reminds scientists of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

If these are actually landforms that are naturally formed on Earth, then ""The Face"" is certainly a natural landform itself.",3,1,0.8755803108215332
dd4cacc,"People are saying there's a face on mars. This is true, people are also questioning if aliens had put it there, it may just be a historical formation on the earth, reasearches believe it may just be a formation and not created by aliens. People have named this formation the ""Face on Mars"" it has become to be a very popular sight that people are wanting to see more and more of it. This is so popular that it has been in ""Hollywood films, appearded in books, magizines, and even talk shows.""

Researchers found this figure on the planet mars, they found this not only weird but very interseting. They thought lets do more research to find out what actually caused this formation on mars. Reasearchers thought at first that aliens had put this figure on the planet because it is a figure of a human face. They took big cameras up into mars and sized the figure so large so they could get closer pictures of the image.

The more research the reasearchers did the more facts they found. They had many sightings like this before and they figured maybe a alien did not put that figure on mars. Reasearchers may have thought this because there had been many different formations on earths surface, it was most likely caused by earths erosion or natural features. They compare some ideas to it just like the ""Middle Butte in the snake river of Idaho."" There had never been sightings of aliens before why would there be now.

The people that work for NASA believe that it most likely ended up being a formation in mars because of the research everyone has done they have come to find that there are most likely no aliens up on mars. They say this because they went back up and looked some more around the area where the face was found to see if there was a ""alien monument."" Come to find out there was no alien monument around or even located on mars so aliens did not cause this. Researchers believe that this was just a normal formation from the planet mars that just occured, but did people?

When this all came to take place the first day they let the news out it went viral. People were wanting to know what caused this and how was this caused. When they realesed the news from the NASA they thought the same thing well it had to be aliens. After all this was no formation by aliens it was simply a formation from the planet itself. After all of this was figured out what really caused it, it went more viral than it was before. It was more popular because everyone was talking about it and it occured in Hollywood movies,Books and even talk shows.

People were wanting to still believe that no landform can just make something like this. They thought how could this be. The planets have their wonders and wow's you just have to let the formations take place and see what amazing things can be done. Also have patience to see what really happened to the item that was found. You might just be amazed for once. Most don't think there could be such amazing feautures on the planets.",3,1,0.8964064121246338
dd5a7fc,"Have you seen the Face on Mars? It was twenty five years ago when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and snapped a photo of a landform that looked much like a human face. We, NASA, have noticed many people made conspiracy theories about the Face being made by aliens. We assure you this is not true. NASA wishes that there was an acient civilization on Mars that constructed the Face. The Face is a natural landform.

The Face is not an alien monument. Eighteen long years after the first mission and the first photograph was taken, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin explained that we felt this was important to taxpayers, so we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. On April 5, 1998, MGS finally flew over the Face and snapped a photo ten times shaper than the orginal. This photo revealed a natural landform. If aliens did create the Face, there would be other clearer signs of alien work. For example, there would be huts, small shack figures or even Egyptain-style pyramids. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all, but not everyone was satisfied, so in 2001, NASA got another photo of it, much clearer and closer this time. It was still just a natural landform.

NASA went through a lot to get the three photos of the Face. The first one in 1976, the second in 1998, and the third in 2001. These three photos have shown everyone very clearly that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. Some even say it reminds then of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. In conclusion, the Face on Mars is, in fact, a natural landform. ",3,1,0.8938902020454407
dd7857b,"Many people believe that the Face was made by aliens while others believe it's a natural landform. Many scientists believe that it was a natural landform which they are correct. Many people believe it was created by aliens becuase of where it is located till this very day. There are many other things on Earth that were created natural such as many mountains and volcanoes.

First, there has been many people since the pictures have came out that believe that aliens made this but why not think of natural landform. There are many and many landforms that were created naturally and many of these landforms didn't make us believe that an alien were to create it. So why believe that aliens created the Face on Mars? I guess they think that since it's in space and nobody lives on Mars it is assumed that aliens were the ones to create this.

Next, scienctists in Mars Global Surveyor has already proven that the Face was created naturally as said on the text. The first time that they came to see the amazing figure, the figure still looked a little bit fuzzy making people still believe of aliens forming it. When scientist found out of people stll believing it was aliens Gavin states, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia."" As they take the trip back again and took a picture the usage of their camera made the photo be seen very incredible. You could see everything very cleary making many people believe now that aliens weren't the ones to create such a beautiful figure like this one.

All though there might be still a few people that believe aliens were the ones who made it, many people can agree of how beatiful and creative this figure was made in Mars. As said on the text the Face reminds many people of different things like landforms here on Earth that was by nature and the appreciation of the Face that is still on Mars making history.",3,1,0.8854378461837769
dd852e1,"Do you believe that NASA is with holding information about an alien species? Many people in fact do. However, their arguments are severely flawed. There are thousands and thousands of naturally made landforms on planet Earth, and we can only logically assume there are even more naturally made landforms in space. The landform that is debatebly the most 'likely to be made by aliens' is the Face from Mars. Contrary to what the alien theorists may say, the Face is only another naturally made landform since in high quality pictures it appears quite normal, there are no strange markings or anything around it, and its appearance is only an illusion.

NASA and its team has tried many and many times to get clear pictures of the Face. Nowadays, its getting some of the best pictures that's ever been taken. Jim Garven quotes, We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. ""..on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,"" furthermore says the article. The pictures showcase the Face as normal and just like any other naturally made landform.

Another thing about the Face that will throw off any conspiracy theorist's opinions is that there are no 'alien monuments' or 'carvings' or 'writings' or anything else around the landform. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all,"" quotes the article. That wouldn't satisfy the theorists so they thought of something else. Which is, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Try as NASA might, they didn't find anything that could possibly be apart of anything alien. They took more pictures of the Face, especially on days where it would be clear, yet they found nothing of the sort.

Now, one of the biggest things about the Face is that its own 'face' is an illusion constructed by shadows. NASA even described it as so. When they released one of their first pictures of the landform, ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" Illusions are everywhere, and this particular illusion of a face happens to be quite popular. Their picture of the Face attracted much attention from the public because of the allure of a face on Mars. As their pictures became more high quality, it became clear how the formation looked and how those shadows made it look the way it did.

Others may still say now, that the pictures that NASA takes might very well be positioned badly or incorrectly in a way that does not reveal anything crucial to alien life. NASA listened to them though, ""few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" Mission controllers made their way to look at the landform once again. A direct quote from Garvin about the situation is, ""Its not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it's hard work."" He and everyone else went out of their way to take the perfect picture on a ""cloudless summer day"". We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution,"" says Garvin once again. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! NASA did their best and better at looking at and around the Face in order to see if they missed anything as important as signs of alien life. They returned with no proof of anything at all as the theorist's would've liked.

To summarize, the Face is a naturally made landform ontop of planet Mars. First of all, in high definition and quality photographs the landform looks normal and not that strange. Secondly, contrary to what alien believers and theorists may have liked to believe there are no 'markings' or etc. around it whatsoever. Lastly, the eyes and nose and mouth that happen to 'appear' on the landform are only an illusion made by shadows, as stated by NASA itself. Earth has just as many natural landforms and even more possibly than Mars. With a trick of the light or seeing it as a particular angle, we could even interpret our own landforms as something that was made by our own hands even if it clearly wasn't. The Face is a clear example of overthinking and reaching for an answer that was already there, it is a naturally made landform. ",6,1,0.88719642162323
dda3ee5,"Clearly with all the evidence that I have proves that The ""Face on Mars"" is just a naturual Landform. Researchers have done way too much to prove that it is not a face but only a landform. Everybody's opinion on The ""Face on Mars"" doesn't effect the truth behind it. Based on the passage, In paragraph 3, it explains that NASA unveiled the image for everybody to see. They explained that it was just a ""huge rock formation"" . . . which resembles an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth formed by shadows.

There is also more reasons as why this is clearly just a natural landorm.

NASA had to make sure they were correct on there research, therefor the orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the original Viking's photo. Which then clearly proved that there so no alien movement after all and once again that it was just a natural landform.

NASA's group didn't yet give up there research on the ""Face on Mars"". they rolled there spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of the view to make sure they didn't miss anything. In paragraph 11, It explains that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see what they were. Which clearly proves that NASA did all the research but yet could not prove anything but a naturual landform.

To conclude my argument, throughout all the research proof and examples i have stated. There is absoulty no research explaniations that proves that the ""Face on Mars"" is anything but a natural landform. Which clearly means that NASA's research is correct and all the research they have done to make it clear was correct. ",3,1,0.9168437719345093
ddc1cdd,"Natural land forms are mistaken for 'alien activity' all of the time. Why should this time be any different. It is simply a natural landform.

There have been other natural mesas on Mars that have been mistaken for alien monuments. The rock formation is not even in the actual face, it is the shadows that the rocks ceate when the sun hits them just right. There was a storm that clouded the Face, so the details have been obscured.

There has been no other proof of aliens, only rambungcous conspiericy theorists. If we had more proof of extra terrestrial life, the theory of the Face would be more believable. In the American West, we have landforms that are common to Martian buttes or mesas. ""It reminds me most f Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" says Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Explorations Program, Jim Garvin. The cheif scientist believes that the Face is a natural landform, and that he compares it to natural landmarks on Earth.

More evidence can and will be provided. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" sayes Garvin. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" With modern cameras, we can see the precise details, and with clear sky over the Face, it proves that the Face is just another natural land form.

We know of other natural land forms on Mars, illusions of shadows, no other proof of aliens, similar to natural land forms on Earth, it would be simple to find little details, and with modern cameras, that take sharper pitures proves that the Face is just a natural landform, not alien activity.",3,1,0.8247631788253784
ddc5a22,"Some people may think that the Face on Mars was made by aliens. Today I am here to share with you that scientificly it is just a natural landform. It is just a conspericy that the Face was made by aliens. The Mars Global Surveyor captured photos of what the Face looks like from above Mars. The image shows a landform on the planet that seems to look very much like a face.

The Face on Mars is scientificly known to be a landform in the planet. This landform is much like the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa. The landform just so happens to look like a face. That's why many people believe that the lanform is was actually made by aliens. Do you know how there are craters on the moon? If so the ""Face"" is almost like that but instead of the crater going in, it's pushing outward. That is the easiest way to describe it.

So far NASA has not found aliens to be real. That doesn't meant that they aren't real. It just means that the face is highly unlikely to be made by aliens. But one day if NASA does discover aliens that might be a possibility that the ""landform"" was made by aliens. But until that day comes around it will just be considered a landform based on scientific facts.

The first spacecraft to see this landform was NASA's Viking 1 in 1976. Then 18 years later, on April 5, 1998, the MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. The picture that the MOC was 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. This became very popular at that time in the past. The Face was used in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. These things started all the talk about the face being created by aliens.

So in all the Face was not made by aliens at all. It just happens to be a natural landform in the shape of a face. I can see where everyone got mistaken but the facts are that it was not made by aliens. So now you will be able to say that you know a lot of things about the Face on Mars! That is everything that I can explain to you about the Face on Mars.",3,1,0.9088516235351562
ddf1b14,"Many uncommon things happen causing people to be very fascinated with a certain subject. Any time something to do with space occurs, many people freak out or become fascinated with the subject. When something to do with space does occur, then usually people believe alien life forms. But with a cleaner and better camera the photos revealed that it was a natural landform and not an alien monument after all.

With an even better camera lense than before the picture is still proof that shows it is a normal, typical landform. Even with small objects you would still be able to clearly see if the object is a landform or a alien life form. The natural landform is equivalent to a butte or mesa. The ""face"" on Mars is still a like to a normal landform on Earth.

The form can not be life like or be alien like due to the amount of information and facts that NASA has to back up its ideas. The conspiracy theorists don't have as many facts as NASA to back up their information and ideas. NASA has majority of the information and facts which over rules the conspiracy theorists information and facts. ",2,1,0.8690665364265442

People do make mistakes about things, but this couldn't be a mistake. They have so much proof that there could be no way that this could be a mistake. They have so many pictures, from different years, of the Face and they all look like part of a natural landform. Landforms do create things that we think it's something else, but it's actually just how nature is sometimes. If the Face had some proof that aliens did it then thigs would be different. People do sometimes just image things that they think it's something but it could sometimes just end up being something simple.

Scientists have gone through everything together and everything just seems to add up that it's just natural landform. They've been up to Mars so many times and done lots of calculations about it. They usually know what is happening and if things do exist or what is causing it to do that. It all adds up that it's just a natural landform and maybe there will be more natural landforms popping up in the future. It's only a natural landform, nothing from aliens.",3,1,0.8989046812057495

martian mesa one fact is that these martian mesa can all so can be found on eath and the can be the same size this show the face can be a martian mesa

likes earths sceod is that martian mesa can be any where in mar there are other ones on mars to this show the its just a martain mesa face that be just a conwece dcenthird is like look like the one on eath in the snake river plain of idaho this show that mesa can be anywhere to wrap up this just is a land mind on mars

my scode reason is nasa one fact is if this was aliens nasa whould of told us like in the artice it said ""nasa budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars"" this shows that there is no aliens there sceod fact is nasa is spending to much money so if there where aliens there would of told us like they told us about the face on mars this show that nasa got nothing to had third fact is that nasa aready look in it for

us and tld ever thing there know this show that nasa is right about the face and to wrap up there nothing there

my third reason is the photos nasa took for a example the frist one just look like a bumb in mars this show that it not even a big deal secod is the photo of 2001 it show there really is in face it third the last photo its show us a face but as one see it there other martian mesa there this show that the face was not made by aliens ot wrap up the face in the photos show us that its not even a face

in conlution the face on mars is just a martian mesa and there is no life on mars and nasa is right but what the photos show us that it looks like a face but its not becaues if it was there would be other and just show aliens life on it so this show that the is not aliens lif on mars and the face is just a martian mesa becaue if you look this is no lif so i ask again do u wonder if ther life on mars are think aliens are on there the answer should be no there not    ",2,1,0.7197898030281067
de88ce9,"This all started 21 years ago. Here is how the face on Mars was discovered. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking pictures for possible landing sites for it's sister Viking 2 and it spotted a shadown of a likely human face. It was a great big head shaped face 2 miles apart from end to end. That is how this all started.

How could aliens make such a thing? There is no way. Some scientist believe that the face was an alien artifact, the photographing from Cydonia became a priorty for NASA when MGS showed up at the Red Planet in Sepmber. The face was not created by some things we like to call aliens that we don't even know if they exist or not, kind of like mermiads or unicorns.

There is to much evidence of how this face could of formed on it's own. It was so bi it would take aliens so long to even make this thing we say that looks like a face. Some people belive that the face is ""bona fide"", which means that that face is evidence that there was life on Mars at one point. Nobody has that big of a face for it to be an actual human face. I believe it is just a natual landform that just happened to look a lot like a human face. The face is exactly located 41 degrees North martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a very cloudy time on the Red Planet. This investigation the scientist haas said has been very hard work to figure out exaclty what it is. I still belive with all the evidence we have it has to just be God's creation and it just apeared to look like a face, no aliens or anything like that because if you want to tell me that aliens did it you better be showing me that aliens even exist first.",2,1,0.8944284915924072
deb4eb3,"I disagree with the belief that the face on mars was created by aliens. I disagree because A team called the MOC proved to us that the face is just a natural landform by taking a picture ten times clearer than the original one. I understand that some might say it was a very cloudy day when they took the pictures, but the team took pictures a couple of years later and proved the same thing ,again.

The face on mars is just a natural landform. I believe it is just a natural landform because, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time in 1998. The team MOC took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Although, some people still say it was cloudy and perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze. It is still possible that they had gotten some very clear photos. On Apirl 8, 2001, on a cloudless day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveror went in for a second look. They used a camera with absolute maximum resolution . For example, "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.""

In conclusion, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. The pictures show landforms common around American west.

The picture acutally only shows the Martian equivalent of butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.(Paragraph 12) Too bad for all those scientist who thought this was an alien artifact.

If you went there would you come back with false or true evidnece to help support what you think it is.

On May 24,2001 the text say, ""Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be starring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia."" This shows that if this two mile long ""human face"" was real this must of had to of been a giant living on Mars. The text also says ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" This shows that this helps us know that it could of just of been a Martian mesa since its common around Cydonia.

In the image of 1998 I can see where they see the face, but then look at the picture from 2001 it just looks like a large landform. Yes it could of decayed but then by the time 1998 come it should have already been decayed and you would of thought that from image from 1976.

Many people would have had there different opinions on if it were really a human face without the 'Resembles a human head"" part or not.

The authors who wrote the story about the resembles a human head thought it would be a good way to have the public engage in attention toward Mars. It did! the text says ""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows.""

Most people belive that it an ancient civilization on Mars, because of what they see in movies, books, magazines, and even rado talk shows.

People think the face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. Those people say that NASA would rather hide evidence of life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists. Few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographong Cydonia became a priority for NASA eighteen years after the mission ened.

Jim Garvin said that they felt that it was important to the taxpayers, so they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a shot of it. In 1998 Mars Global Sureyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original.

The 2001 picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landfroms common around the American West.

Aliens are another term for forigners or people from other countries, but this was in 1976-2001 when almost everyone believed in aliens. The National

Areonautics Space Administration wasn't created to see if aliens are real or not, is was created to study something in space other than just Earth. Aliens do not excist so there is no possible way that they can make a face of a human from Mars, it is just a natural landform that so happens to look like a face.

The thing about people's imagination is that they'll believe anything that someone tells them. Most people are like brainwashed monkeys about to be tested on. I myself used to believe in ""alien lightforces"" when I was young. People in the late 1900s were very childish and had creative minds. Why would someone even doubt that the image that was taken isn't just a natural landforce, it would be almost stupid if someone would doubt.

In late June last year some man took a picture of something that looks like a UFO, I can now see how people would thing that aliens are real. However this new age of technology has been so equipped with the use of photoshop. People that can photoshop can control almost half of the worlds' minds. The fact is that since aliens aren't real, there is no possible way that they can make a human face from the Mars dirt. It has to be just a natural landform. ",3,1,0.7345199584960938

There are many reason why aliens bulit the structure but not very good reasons. While there is scientificly proven facts and statements that the aliens did not build the structures and that it is all natural landform.

Many people believe that the aliens bulit the structure but they are wrong, there's no alien building something so we can capture its making. Just like on the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" sentence 7 it says, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The first time the Viking took the pictures the camera didn't have the good resoultion that the camera had now, so it looked like a face or alien monument but really it was just some natural landscape.

Although there are credible information, there is just people who don't believe the information. They think it really was aliens building the monuments/structures. Like it says on sentence 5 ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" Meaning that the conspiracy theorists believe that it is NASA trying to hide the real evidence on the aliens. They think NASA is trying to trick them and they are not falling for it. But whar they don't have is credible resourses like NASA does.

Now that technology has become a lot better NASA could now use a better camera for better pictures for the natural landscape on Mars. Like it says on sentence 11 ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" says Gavin, this is saying that now that they have a camera that is 3 times better they could now see things much more clearly and better and all the natural landscape there is.

In counclusion, the structures that were seen on Mars are really just natural lanscape just like when it says on sentence 12, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-- landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" says Gavin, this is comparing the Middle Butte to the natural landscape on Mars because it's saying that landscapes do have things in common like how they are naturally made by, the planet it's on.

e01085e,"About twenty-five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spotted a shadowy human face on Mars. Upon returning to Earth, scientists concluded that this shadowy face is simply a natural landform on Mars. Although conspiracy theorists and the media tend to warp the truth, it is in fact true that this face is nothing but a landform on Mars. NASA conducted two investigations, and used data they gathered and used dated the gathered prior to the ""Face on Mars"" to reach their conclusion.

The first image of the ""Face on Mars"" was taken in 1976. After receiving this information scientists concluded that this was actually another martian mesa, which is common in Cydonia, the place on Mars the image was taken. The image was released a few days later to the public. There was an uproar of theories and conclusions immediately made by the public and the media. This caused problems for NASA. The theory that NASA is hiding life on Mars from the public was a common theory made by conspiracy theorists. The public disregarded NASA's thorough investigation and proof and believed the theorists, who did not have any proof or support, rather than believing the scientists who had taken time to investigate this image and its origin.

A few scientists began to believe that the Face was actually an alien artifact. NASA then figured that the image of the Face would be important for the public. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and a camera team took pictures that were ten times clearer than the ones taken in 1976. Upon returnung to Earth scientists revealed yet again that the ""Face on Mars"" was a natural landform. This was no suprise to some people because the scientists had concluded before that the Face was a mere landform and nothing else, even after investigating the image twice.

NASA conducted yet another investigation on April 8, 2001 in order to make sure the Face was not created by aliens. A camera team took more photographs of the Face and made them bigger to get vloser look. Scientists concluded once more that the Face is the equivalent of a butte or a mesa. This is because landforms that are alike to buttes and mesas are common on Mars. The images that were taken also showed no form of alien life or markings near or on the Face. The scientists who believed that this was a simple landform were correct since the begining, unlike the media and theorists who made up their own conclusions to confuse the public.

After a face-like landform was found on

Mars in 1976, many people believed that there was life on Mars that NASA was hiding from the public. This theory is not true. NASA conducted two investigations after discovering the Face: one on April 5, 1998 and one on April 8, 2001. After both investigations scientists concluded that the "" Face on Mars"" was in fact nothing but a natural landform. This conclusion made by NASA is true. It has been stated the these types of landforms that resemble buttes or mesas are common in Cydonia, the place the Face was found. Both times the images were taken a special camra crew took photgraphs for analyzation. On the second investigation the image was made three times bigger. After not finding any evidenve of alien life form or markings near or on the Face, scientists concluded that the ""Face on Mars"" has always been a landform.            ",4,1,0.8890789747238159
e026f3c,"Space is always going to be a mystery to us. We will never be able to explore all of our universe. However, we can stil hold hope that maybe there are other life forms out in space. So when ""The Face"" was found on Mars in the region Cydonia, many people were shocked, especially the public! Many people think that ""The Face"" is real, although the images resemble landforms here on Earth, the images show it is a landform, and scientists have checked the image and conclude that it is just another landform. This is why the face on Mars is just a natural landform.

Have you ever found a small object around your house and wondered; What is this thing? So you compare it to other household objects and find that it resembles something you have. This is exactly what scientists have done with ""The Face"". They weren't sure what it was exactly, but after careful evaluation, they found it looks just like a butte or a mesa- landforms that are found in the American West. This is why ""The Face"" is just a landform, because it is exactly like a bunch of landforms found lots of places. In the text it says, ""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" This statement shows how the Face is a replica of landforms on Earth, and how it is nothing more than that. These reasons show how the Face is nothing more than a ordinary, dull landform found on Mars.

Imagine this. You are about to look through a microscope to observe a piece of grass. Now without the microscope, you see an ordinary, green weed. However, when you take a look at the grass with a microscope, you can see all of the cells, and pigments, and structures that make the grass appear the way it does. Scientists have taken these exact steps in order to classify the Face for what it is, which is a landform. The images show the face is just a natural landform. Without a careful evaluation, the image looks like a real face. Likewise, when scientists went and examined the Face with a careful observation, they found that the shadows, and angles, and structures of the landform all made it appear as a face. In the passage it states, ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" This piece from the article stands to show that images prove the Face is a landform. Agree or disagree with me, the proof is in the pudding.

I know many people who want to point out others flaws, yet are blind to their own. I know any people who strut around boasting how wise, glorious, and flat-out amazing they are, but have nothing to show for all of their talk. I am sure you know atleast one person like this: we all do. However, when a rocket scientist tells you a picture of a Face is a landform, and has proof to back it up, chances are you will agree with them because you know they are wise and capable of finding the right answer. This is why the Face is just a landform, not only can scientists walk the walk, but they can talk the talk! They have evidence that shows the Face is a landform, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument afterall."" Stements like this can be believed becasue they are coming from intelligent people who know what they are talking about.

Whereas I know that the Face is just a landform, many people think ""the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" While I can agree that a huge discovery like this might want to be kept a secret for a while in order to figure out what the next step would be, why would you not trust somebody who has an enormous amount of intelligence? Are you a rocket scientist? No. So why doubt one when they tell you that they have examined the Face and found it is nothing more than a landform?

The Face on Mars is a natural landform. Scientists have compareed it to other landforms on Earth, checked the images which show it is a landform, and scientists all agree that it is, in fact, a natural landform. Many people want to keep their hope alive by suggesting NASA wants to keep the actual evidence a secret, but at the end of the day, who know more? You or a Rocket Scientist? I think we both know the answer. Now, we might find aliens in the future, but for now we are yet to have any company in Space.           ",6,1,0.8706016540527344

In 1976 NASA´s Viking 1 was circling Mars to see where its sister ship Viking 2 could land when it arrived on Mars. It was snapping photos when suddenly it spotted something that looked like a human face. It looked like the head was staring right back at the camera. It was from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The people controlling the ship

were surprised to see an object that looked like a human face. Scientists then figured out it was a Martian mesa but had an unusual shadow that made it look like a Pharaoh. A few days after seeing the image NASA unveiled the image to the public. They thought it was a good idea to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. In fact it did attract the attention of a lot of people. It has become a pop icon. It has stared in a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in the grocery store. Some people think the face is evidence of life on Mars,which is information that NASA would want to hide from people. It became a priority for NASA to get more photos of Cydonia. In 1998 the team snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original photos. Many people were on the Internet to see the image right after it was put on the web. It turns out that it was just a natural landform. Not everyone was pleased though. Some people said that the camera had to peer through clouds so the alien jmarkings were hidden by haze. In 2001 there were no clouds in Cydonia so the team took another picture. This photo is very clear and shows no evidence that it is a face. It shows that it is a natural landform.

Has your viewpoint of the object changed? If you still think that it is a alien created object then look at the picture from 2001. There are no clouds to block anything that would make you think it is a face. In the first photo it is a shadow that makes it look like a face. Also the

photo is very blurry. The less blur there is the more it looks like a natural landform not a face.",2,1,0.8604053258895874

This is an excerpt from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". This is describing a strange feature found on the face of mars in the region of Cydonia.

At first there were no clear pictures of the face and no certain explanations. The Viking 1 found it in 1976 and back then the quality was not so great. Scientists thought ""it was just another Martian mesa"" but they also noted one unusual shadow, so they were not that clear on the reason. In 1998 NASA took another picture in better resolution but it was cloudy and some people were not convinced that it was a mesa. In 2001 NASA was finally able to capture a clear picture of the formation, putting down any kind of conspiracy theories.

Speaking of conspiracy theories, many believed that ""...the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars"". Some theories were that aliens built ""an Egyptian pharoah"". Some of the scientists at NASA even believed that it was evidence of alien life on mars! Conspiracy theorists say that NASA would rather hide life on Mars, but defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilisation on mars becuase then NASA would get more money to go to mars.

Now with higher resolution pictures NASA scientists have found what the ""Face"" really is. It seems that their earlier guesses were in fact correct! As quoted in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"". The scientists were correct on saying it looked like a mesa. They have even found out with higher resolution pictures that it almost resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. They both have a similar height and shape.

Conspiracy Theorists have battled these NASA claims since the image was first released. Very little NASA scientists believe in these Theoretical claims.

These photos spread very quick, and theorists everywhere published books, movies, and more science fiction entertainment about 'The Face.' NASA new from the start the unusual photo was only of arock fromation similar to buttes and mesas, common landforms in the West Americas. While the scientists do address the fact that the landform appears as a face, it is only the shadows of an extra-terrestrial mesa.

NASA is still investigasting other mysterious evidence that could eventually lead to a real science-fiction dream, maybe an alien apocalypse or an abduction? Theorists can only hope.",2,1,0.8294383883476257
e233513,"25 years ago something hysterical happen around Mars.

NASA'S spacecraft called Viking 1 was circumnavigating the planet, snapping photos of possible landning sites for the other spacecraft viking 2.

When Viking 2 was found, it was a shadow likeness of a human face.

It was huge, its length was two miles from end to end. The caption noted it was huge rock formation, but it resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

That does not mean it was an alien, it just means that thats the way the natural landform formed.

The ""Face on Mars"" has been everywhere from Hollywood films to grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

Very few scienists believe that he Face was an alien artifact, phtographing Cydonial became a priority for NASA and Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Septemebr and the year of 1997, about eighteen long tirinig years after the Viking mission concluded.

It says in the story that the team which is called MOC snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Vikings photograph.

Thousands of peoples anxiety were coming out when they searched the web waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing the answer.

The answer is a Natural landform, there was no alien monument after all.

On April 8, 2001 a war summer day in Cydonia.

Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,""

said Garvin.

Malin's crew captured and extraordinary image using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Each pixel in he 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.

But as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times better and bigger that pixel size.

So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they where.

The picture actually reveals that there is a martian equivalent of butte or mesa landforms common around the American West.",1,1,0.851081371307373
e250c3b,"Scientist know that the face is created by something else, but someone thinks aliens created it. I don't think aliens can do that. Many things could be the cause of the face on Mars, but I'm sure it's not aliens. Scientist have not proven that aliens are even real yet. If aliens were real scientist would know about it, and they might try to capture one. The face would of been causes by wind, the spacecraft, or it could of been a natural landform.

The face on Mars could have been caused by the wind. When planets rotate it could have cause some wind, and the wind could start to form piles of dirt. The dirt could have been moved into the shape of a face. The shadows give it an illusion of eye, nose, and mouth. The face didn't have any footprints around it so aliens couldn't done it. On Earth the wind blows, and pollen from one flower goes to another. Dirt on Mars could of blew to one area, and it could form a face.

Spacecrafts flying around Mars could have cause the face to appear. The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles. Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big. When the scapecraft takes off it could form the face because when air is blown out it leaves a mark. A spacecraft couldn't have left a mark by the face. The fuel on the spacecraft could of left a mark after blasting off Mars.

The face on Mars could be there naturally. It is the third planet from the sun. If there's any volcanoes; lava can explode out of it. Aliens wouldn't come out, and randomly make a face to scare people. The face on Mars must be natural because I don't believe that aliens are real. If aliens are real we probably would have seen one by now. Aliens can't be alive; if they were alive they would have to find food sometime.

However, the face could be have been maded by aliens. I'm stil shocked that people think they're real. I've never seen one before. aliens could be able to fly, and they don't have to touch the ground. The could pick up the dirt, and place it where ever they want to form the face. Inconclusion I still don't believe in aliens, but something had to happen to Mars. It could of been a natural landform or it could of been a spacecraft flying around Mars. They world may never know how the face was created, but I'm positive that aliens didn't create it.",4,1,0.8128224611282349
e2565cd,"Some people choose to say that the Face was created by aliens, but I am here to tell you that it definetly is not an alien structure, simply a natural landform. In 1976 I must say, it certainley did resemble a man made face. Though now that we have a clearer picture from 2001 it is very obviously just a natural landform. It resembles landforms similiar to the ones around the Amercian West. It is really just the Martian equivilent to those particular landfoms. The two are so similar in formation and shape.

The most recent picture is so clear and high definition that even if it werre some kind of shack or Egyptian pyramid, you would know it for a fact. The picture taken in 1998 was on a slightly cloudy day, so I understand the doubt from some of you. Though we did take another picture, and it was on a very clear summer day, and it is mothing but a simple lava dome, that has taken the form of an isolated mesa about the same height os the Face on Mars.

It was very hard work just to try and get that picture, and I would like to assure you that it is definetly no ""Martian Made"" structure. We got very close on a very clear day, and you can definelty see that those were just shadows, and nothing short of a dissapointment. What you don't understand is, that it would benifit us if it was a Martian's craft. It would give the tax payers evidence and reason to support us and give us their money to support the cause. SO therefore I rest my case tht clearly we are not lying because it would benifit us if there were Aliens crafting these thing, but the simple fact is, there isn't.",3,1,0.8696790933609009

e2797ec,"Alot of ignorant theorists claim that us, NASA, is purposely editing these photos and spewting lies to the general public to hide evidence of alien civilization. One of these people is this man, named Billy Bob. Billy Bob claims that a few blurred photos immediately mean that there used to be civilization on Mars. So, how about you guys help me convince that Billy Bob here, is wrong. So let's get started!!!!

So once upon a time, in 1976, we sent an MGS to take photos of Mars. One of these said photos, with our technology at the time, blurred different parts and shadows of a Martian butte or mesa to look like a face. A few days later, we, ""Unveiled the image for all to see"". We reasoned that this human-esque photo was going to enchant the public and attract attention to Mars, which it ineed did!!!

The ""Face of Mars"" has appeared in various forms of media for twenty-five years. Some think it immediately proves an ancient civilization on Mars. There are many here at NASA that wish it was true, but alas it isn't. Few of us believe in the Face. Years after, with a ten times sharper camera, we got a great shot of it, revealing it to be a natural landform.

But the problem is that many conspiracy theorists still try to bring in people to their rediculous false theory using either a)No evidence to support their claim or

b)Extremely bad evidence that has no sense to it, such as; The theory saying that we are trying to hide the ancient civilization of Mars to somehow benefit us. How rediculous is that?!?! First of all, how, in what way, would that benefit us? Second of all, wouldn't it benefit us if it was a civilization? Because with active evidence of aliens, the government would most likely fund a great expedition to Mars to either examine the remnants of this old civilization, or to see if they are still there, to perhaps set up peaceful relations with this new alien race of sentient lifeforms.

Now, there are many other theories to somehow suggest that the Face is real, but the simple debunking of that one should be able to prove that the Face isn't even a face, but a simple natural landform that got blurred with old technology. Plus, not only that, but I doubt that anyone wants this type of ""rant"" to go on any longer. So, I'd say that Billy Bob has learned the truth, wouldn't you?",4,1,0.7851221561431885

They all prove that it is a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

It was not created by aliens.

Here is some evidence. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" Another piece of evidence is it was describes as a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

Last but not least I have one more piece of evidence ""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" They thought is was made by aliens because they usually don't see this face. Now that they know it is a natural landform they will always see it.

At the beginning everyone thought that aliens made this. ""It has been shown in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" All of this evidence proves that it was just a natural landform no one ever noticed. ",2,1,0.8985873460769653
e2cd1e4,"My fellow scientist thinks that there is life on Mars because of the ""human face"" that was found on Mars in 1976, but I can give him three reasons why there isn't any life on Mars and that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform. One reason is that the ""face"", based on the 2001 photo, looks a lot like landforms on Earth. My second reason is that if there was any chance that there was life on Mars NASA would keep it to themselves. My final reason is that Cydonia has many other known mesas, why would this one be special?

In 1976 and 1998 I do admit it does look a little bit like a face, but in 2001, with the better graphics, the ""face"" looks nothing like a face. In 1976 it was very popular because it made people believe in life on Mars, but with the enhanced graphics the popularity of this ""face"" went down because people started realizing that it was not a face. Also, it looks almost the exact same as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

If this ""face"" was made by aliens, NASA would more than likely keep it to themselves. If NASA were to tell this to the public saying that it was an extraterrestrial made landform, the whole entire world would freak out. They would most likely be terrified of the aliens. Another reason is since the United States' NASA found this they wouldn't want other countries to know about this, so we could be the ones to discover life on Mars beforwe the rest of the world.

In the region of Cydonia on Mars, there are a lot of other mesas and buttes. Why would this one be any different? If Martians made a mesa that looks like a face, why would they put it around other mesas. They would most likely put in a region that doesn't draw attention to keep there life a secret.

In conclusion, the ""face"" on Mars is just a natural landform because it looks like landforms on Earth, Cydonia has a lot more known mesas, so this is another of its many mesas, and last but not least, NASA would never tell the world that there is extraterrestrial life on Mars.",4,1,0.8910784125328064
e2d253c,"On May 24, 1976, NASA's Viking one spacecraft was circling mars. It took many photos of landing sites for its sister ship Viking two. As viking one took pictures, it came across a pecuiliar formation on the surface of the planet. The formation seemed to be an enormouse head similar to that of a humans. The scientist figured it was just another Martioan mesa, that was commonly spread throught the surface of Mars.

Conspiracy theorists think that it is bona fide evidence that there is life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acncient civilization on Mars. And so on April 5, 1998 another Mars global surveyor flew over and took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. This led the the scientist to conclude and reveal that the face was just a natural land form and that it wasn't an alien monument at all.

Some people were not happy. The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north of the martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. This was a coudy time of year on Mars. They had said that the camera the pictures had been taken with had to peer through clouds to see the Face. They believed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze at the time.

On April 8, 2001, there was a cloudles day on Mars. The surveyor drew close for another picture. They said they increased the image quality to take the best picture they had taken of the face. They added that in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixle size you could see things like airplains, egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks.

This showed people that it was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. This showed that the conspiracy theorists had been proven wrong. Since NASA actually researches theier data to learn more about it and they make hypothesize, it shows that they have a lot of since in saying that theorists are wrong. Theorist just make theories and they don't have anything to back them up if someone were to arugue about the subject.

Under paragraph 5 you see a photograph of the face and many landforns surrounding it, so as you can see many landforms stand out on Mars.

In paragraph 3 it says (shadoes gave the landform eyes,a mouth,and nose) so its a landform with a face but the shadows make up the face. NASA has been studying this for a long time,but for what ?, as you bcan see its just a landform not a face.

In paragraph 7 it clearly says(thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image on the JPL website but when it appeared it revealed just a natural landform.). There was no momument after all.

e363a0c,"In 1976, Viking 1, a spacecraft, was in search for its sister ship, Viking 2. When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as ""The Face on Mars."" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.

Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.

On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.

Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look. The 2001 one picture was such a high-quality picture, it was said if there were any objects on the ground, they would easily be able to zoom in and identify what it was. Now NASA had proved that this brilliant ""face"" was only a landform.

NASA did endless amounts of research in hopes of finding evidence of martian life, so why would they hide something like that? Releasing this to the public would benefit them more tahn if they hid it. The latest picture the spacecraft took of the landform proves that it simply IS only a landform.

e376553,"It makes sense that people think this is evidence of an ancient civilization, but according to NASA they wish it was. Nowadays, with science fiction rapidly advancing it's hard to not imagine or want aliens and any sort of other life to exist because of how extraordinary it would be. Up until today NASA hasn't found any life out there, but they want to and all the other science enthusiasts do aswell. If this was a clue to other life out there, just stumbling upon this was way too easy. Obviously, others like this have been found, meaning this isn't anything more special than a natural landform. If aliens really did exist there is a small chance NASA would just easily stumble upon evidence like this one because if this was real it's too good to be true.

Realistically, there's so much reasoning from the experts themselves proving that this isn't anything unusual. First of all there's a thing called shadows and they can easily turn a natural figure into looking like some human-like structure. NASA will literally use technology we don't have access to such as more high-tech cameras to find out things no one ever knew existed. Obviously there are landforms like a butte or mesa meaning this isn't something never found. In fact there's one in Idaho called the,""Snake River Plain of Idaho"".

Honestly they are the smarter ones, so there's nothing some regular people with opinions can prove. When the picture was shown it shows the landform started to change or deform, meaning if the structure is able to do such a thing looking like a face had no purpose.

e458750,"Fake Face

In 1976, in the mission control room, the scientists founded something eerie on Mars, there was a human face on it! Many scientists said that it was just a Martian mesa, but many people still stuck to their primal thoughts instead of the scientists' well-educated minds. Scientists stated that the face was just founded out that it's just a mesa. Also, Earth have a similar structure as the ""Face"". And finally, if scientists discovered extraterrestrial life on Mars, what will prevent them from talking about the upcoming major event in scientific history. Many conspiracy theorists may state that this ""Face"" is a clear evidence that there are life on Mars. But how could there be life on Mars just judging that there is a landform that looks like a face? Therefore, this states that Mars don't hold life.

In Mars, there are many landmarks, canyon, mountains, and, of course, mesa. Life on Mars would be impossible due to harsh weather going down below freezing, and absence of liquid form of water. Then how could a creature make a monument that is two miles long without getting burned, frozen, or starve? With these harsh environment we can conclude that nothing can create this except that it got created naturally. With these reasons, we can conclude that this ""Face"" cannot get created by extraterrestrial lives.

Furthermore, Earth also have similar landforms as Mars. In the Western America, there are hundreds of butte or mesa. Mesa is a structrue that consists of elevated area with a flat top. Scientists say that the ""Face"" is just a mesa. In fact, a lava dome mesa that have similar quality with the ""Face"" that is located on Mars. Also, human brain is linked to analyzing faces. When you go to a sightseeing area, you may see some rocks that are shaped interesting, or during your way to work, you may see many non-human objects that looks like a face. So how could a structure that is present on Earth be a proof that life exists on Mars? In conclusion, Mars cannot hold life that many peoples believe.

And finally, scientist would not keep a vital discovery as a secret. Many space-related articles state that discovering life outside of Earth would be recorded as a major event in history. And if a scientist discover an alien, then he or she would be rewarded tremendously. Will anybody tries to prevent this ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" probably not. Also, scientists would be delighted for an advance in technology, they would not leave the aliens alone, they would attempt a communication to the aliens and try to learn many things about their life. Consequently, this shows that aliens don't exist in Mars.

Some may say that the ""Face"" is a clear example to show the life on Mars, and that these creatures created this landform as a sign or as an art. However, with art or sign, they would live near the structure, but there are no sign of a life around the area. Also, it is not reasonable to believe what the conspiracy theorists are stating. They do not have clear evidence, they are just following their primal thoughts like a primitive life. Clearly, it is not wise to believe the conspiracy theorists over the scientists in NASA.

All in all, this proves that life cannot survive on Mars. The ""Face"" is proven to be a mesa that is common on Mars. Also, there are similar landforms in Earth called as the lava dome mesa that have very similar properties with the ""Face. And finally, scientists would not attempt to keep this amazing discovery as a secret on their own but share with the world instead. It is unwise to trust yourself and not the others to make you well informed and educated.

After that thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appere, when finally when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natrual landing form. There was no Alian monument after all.

If the ""face"" was created by an Alian/Anlians there would be trakings of them and all that and it was really hard to see because it was winter at the time. They dont pass the unknown figure very offten, but when they did they payed really close attintion to the figure. They took more pictures to discover them. They still found know tracings or sighs that alians made this.

What the picture really showes is the Martiam equivalent of a butte or mesa- landingforms common around American West. ""Its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight and the Face on Mars.""   ",2,1,0.7654816508293152
e48707a,"We have created a face on the surface of our planet. Doesn't that sound stupid, I mean if there is intellagent life out there why would they waste there time puting a face on a planet. That face is nothing but a mountain or rock formation that looks like a face.

First off the area the probe was flying over and taking pictures of was know to have mesas. Like the article had said at in paragraph two "" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" Which is where the probe was flying over. Most scientist believe it is just a landform with the face looking structure.

Next when NASA got another probe into space to take better pictures, just to show the people like you who think it was made by aliens that it is in fact just a rock formation. They took another picture and people still didn't believe them so depsite how hard it is to position it to take another picture they did it anyway and it looked nothing like a face, But more like a mountain.

Lastly most of the stuff made up about the face on mars. when they released the photo like it said in the article ""it stared in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" It's just made up by people to either sell more stuff in there gift shop or store and or make movies and books. Because who would want to watch a movie about the extroudanary mountain on mars. They would have to make false info about it and say it was made by aliens so it would sell more.

You may say that that probe is floating very far away from space how do you know there is not any evidence of life down there? Well yes It is very far away but the picture was taken in maxium resilution. Each pixel spans 1.56 meters so each pixel in that photo spaned 1.56 meters on the planet so you would be able to see anything that would have show alien life down there.

So yes it was nothing but a mountain that looked like a face. Next time you look at somthing that looks like it could be alien in outer space don't believe movies or novels belive the scientist they know what there doing and know what is for the better of human knowledge not some persoon trying to make some money by saying that aliens made it so you would buy it.

e4a732b,"The Face on Mars may look like a alien artifact, but in reality, it is just another natural landform. NASA's Viking 1 found a ""human face"" twenty-five years ago on Mars. It was said to be nearly two miles from end to end. Most scientists just thought it was another common Martian mesa. A few days later, NASA put out the image for the world to see. The authors said it was a huge rock formation that resembled a human head. They also mentioned that the shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. It was believed to be just another rock.

Since the story, the ""Face on Mars"" starred in films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Many people thought the Face is evidence of life on Mars, but would soon realize it was just a rock formation. Even a few scientists actually believed that the Face was an alien artifact. After these rumors, photographing Mars became a priority. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped ten pictures. Many anxious people waited for an image to appear on a JPL web site. The image did not reveal a alien monument, but a natual landform.

On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor was taken out for another look at the Face. The picture shows a buttle or mesa; which are landforms common around the American West. Although the Face was believed to be some type of alien artifact, after three times of exploring, it was still proven to be just another natural landform. ",2,1,0.9070292115211487
e4b6025,"After a long agrument with one of my co-workers deciding whether or not the Face on Mars was made by the aliens or the picture was a picture of a natural landform we both had different opinions on what we thought it really was.

My co-worker tried to convince me that aliens put the Face on Mars. He told me that by the looks of the picture it looked as if it was an alien artifact. He then stated that you could barely tell from the picture what exactly it is.

I told him I thought it was a natural landform that either looks like a butte or a messa. I also stated that the picture actually shows a Martian that kinda looks like a butte or messa. I then stated that the picture reminds me somewhat of a Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.

He then decided that we should try and attempt to take a better and that we would decide from there. He sent Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team to snap a photo ten times as sharper as the last one. He then decided that I was right and that he was wrong because when the image first appeared on web surfers it revealed a natural landform. The picture also revealed that there was no alien monument to be seen after all.

Inconclusion, after the long agrument we both agreed with my opinion. So it turns out that my co-workers opinion wasn't true. And we found out after taking the last photo that the Face of Mars came to be a natural landform.       ",3,1,0.8365683555603027

There are so many people in the world that thought the face was created by aliens, but it really wasn't. It's just like all of the landforms on Earth that were created by people, animals, plants, and much more. NASA and a couple of scientists had an arugment about whither it was a face created by aliens or landformation. In the end it was created just like all the other landformations. I bet people still wander if NASA was right or wrong.

Well now that i told you about the face and what people think. Do you still believe in what you first thought before reading this? Maybe your right and maybe your wrong everyone has their own opinion. ",2,1,0.7775508165359497
e4c81e7,"NASA has gotten so many questions about this face on mars. Is it created by aliens , is it a sign ? So many question unanswered to world about this face made about the unknown. People have wanted answers and

I'm a NASA scientist will give it to them as truthful as I can.

First question , Is this face made by aliens ? Most common question of all , NASA isn't really for sure if aliens made this becuase we still don't have proof of alien life or life on Mars. We haven't went to down on Mars to detect it or scan it . See if it was a rock formed by Mars itself or was it just there before and we haven't noticed it .

Next question, Is this an sign by the unknown and if it is what would earth do

or NASA ? NASA has already think that

this face remind this of a natural landform on earth but we are not sure if this is an sign from what you may call it the unknown. If is was an sign from the unknow , we would probably go check it out and see if there any life on Mars form this to appear.

Finally question , Do you NASA scientist believe that Mars made this on it own ? Mars could have made this on it own, but we are going with that thorie until we go check it out scan it , run test the whole nine yard before we go with something we are not sure about . Mars have made rock own it own before or it can be just an meator land then and made it.             ",1,1,0.8702816963195801
e4ca453,"What is the face on Mars? This is a question many asked themselves when the face was first discovered by the Viking 1 in 1976. Some believed it was proof that there is or was life on Mars, while others believed it was exactly what it is acutally a natural landform. Similar to the ones that form commonly in the American West such as a mesa or butte. These are the facts that cemented NASA's belief that this wasn't some alien made landfrom but rather a naturally occuring one.

Althrough few scientist believed that the face like formation was an alien artifact it still became a priority of ours at NASA to get a better quality photograph, so we could prove wether it was a natural landform or man made by unknown martians. On April 5, 1998 after years of speculation and conspriacys that it was bulit by martains and that we were trying to hide this ""information"", we finally got a shot at taking another photo of the face when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The picture taken with the Mars Global Surveyor was ten times sharper than the original VIking photos. These photo were what we needed to cement the fact that it was not an alien monument at all and instead a natural landfrom.

Not everyone was happy with this photo though. The Face on Mars is located in a very difficult place to photograph and when the MOC took the picture in 1998 there were wispy clouds you had to look past. The conspriators believed the alien marking maybe covered by said clouds. So alas we set out again to take another picture this time on April 8th, 2001 a cloudless summer day Cydonia. Malin's team snapped an incredible picture. What the picture showed to us was that the landfrom was the martian equivilent of a butte or mesa. Exactly what we belived it was... a natural landform.

This essay may or may not have made you believe me in what this landform acutally is, but what you believe it is doesn't not change the proof of the pictures. I do hope that this enlightened you as well as convince you of the landform being completely natural. I hope you enjoyed reading my argument if I could not convince you. thank you for taking your time to read this.",4,1,0.9121019244194031
e4e3d0f,"Those pictures you see aren't pictures of aliens and they are not prints that show that aliens have been through. In 1976 the Face on Mars picture was taken, but when it was taken the camera was through some clouds, so when it took the picture it was probably some shadow of the clouds. It even says the when this picture was taken it was a cloudy day ""it was winter in April '98 a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.""

The picture could just be some dust that has moved around a bunch of time at had made a face figure out of the dust and debre. The pictures also look different over time which was probably the dust and sand moving it all around. Plus there are really strong and heavy storms almost every single night at mars. so the dust, sand, and rocks are flying every where so that can cause disfiguer to anything. So before you jump to conclusion about it being aliens you should know more facts about what happens in mars on a day to day basis.",2,1,0.7447222471237183
e57467e,"What would you do if you saw a face on Mars? Twenty five years ago we found a landform that looks like a face on mars surface. It is a big ovle that looks like it has eyes a face and nose. The face is looking right out into outer space and it has a veiw of the whole solar system. When the NASA spacecraft called Viking 1 taking pictures of spots were its sister ship could land Viking 2 it was if the face was looking at them. There is not a face on mars, it is just a landform with a shadow that makes it look like a face.

There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. In paragraph three is says that A few days after discovering the face they set it out for all to see, and the caption noted ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, and took pictures with there Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) they revealed that there were no aliens and that it was just a landform.

In paragraph eight it says that not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at forty-one degrees norht martian latitude where it was winter in april '98 a cloudy time of year on the planet. So skeptis said that perhaps the the alien markings were hidden by the haze. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids you could tell what they are.

What the picture actually shows is the Matian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around American West. This pictures shows a face but it is just a landform with a shadow making it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. People think that aliens are making signs saying that this land is theres but its just a landform nothing more, nothing less. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydoria Mars Global Surveyor (MOC) drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolutuin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

The Face on Mars has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for twenty five years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancietn civilazation on Mars. But there is no such thing as aliens, nothing can live on mars or any other planets besides earth. Some scientists think that the Face was an alien artifact, photographing \Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the red planed in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.

e576be9,"There was an funny looking landform on Mars. That other scientist had tooken a picture of in 1976 and mars that look like a face icon. the picture was blurry and we couldnt really tell what it was so many people had did research on it. Many scientist like me and different people thought it was different things. Like just a regular natural landform in Mars and others think it is a face that a lien had left there to show a icon. We also had a arguent over what it really was. Me as a scientist and other people that thought it was a icon that aliens marked.

I, as a scientist disagree about what many people think it is. I personally think its just a regular natural landmark in Mars. Others think its a icon for something a alien made because its shaped as a face a few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. Some people think the face is nonafide evidence of real life on Mars. Us scientist had describe the icon which resembles a human head . its formed bve shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth. This have attracted alot of people attention to Mars.

This icon have became very popular. For example in pargargraph 5 its says "" its starred in Hollywood Films, appeared in books, magazines, and is in radio talk shows. This shows that the icon is really popular and many people know and talk about the icon.

Around April 5 in 1998 Mars global flew over Cydonia for the first time and took a better picture of the icon for we can tell what it was more cleary then the other pictures they had. We discovered that it was just a natural landforn and there wasnt no alien icon.

There was nothing else really said about the natural landform because we know what it is now but we also know that its not essay to target Cydonia.",3,1,0.7934262752532959
e5a9b76,"A vast majority of people who have seen ""The Face on Mars"" belive that it was created by aliens.

This cannot be true because there is too much evidence to disprove this conspiracy theory.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens because it, in fact, does not even resemble a face, and there are many others like it on Mars.

There is too little evidence supporting that it was created by aliens, but there is pleanty of evidence that supports the fact that it is just another rock formation on Mars.

One example of this evidence is that The Face doesn't look like a face at all.

In the passage ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is states that the picture taken in 2001 of the eleged face ""actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""

In the 2001 image taken by MSG (Mars Global Surveyor) you can clearly see the large rock formation that is present on Mars surface.

It very clearly shows that it is not a face created by ancient aliens.

Some strong belivers in the theory that think it was created by aliens state that NASA is covering up the truth and not telling the public the truth about the Face.

This however just would not make any sense.

If there was an ancient civilization out there on Mars NASA would want to make it public because this would benifit them.

They would be funded by the government to study the artifacts or maybe even lifeforms out there.

In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it states that ""the defenders of the NASA budget wish ther was an acient civilization on Mars.""

Not telling the public about alien civilizations just would not be a smart move on NASA's part.

This wouldn't be the first time NASA has found a huge rock formation on Mars surface.

Scientists have come across a massive amounts of rock formations in the time they have been exploring Mars.

This is just another one of those cases.

When NASA released the picture of the Face to the public in the caption they noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head."" (NASA)

NASA never did mean for the Face to be hugely popular and for theories of it being an acient civilization.

It probably never crossed their mind that theories this preposturous would appear.

They just wanted to draw attention to Mars and the space program.

There are a large number of rock formations on Mars and this was just another one of those boring old rocks. The face just goes to show how people are fantastic at blowing things out of proportion.

These formations cannot and were not built by an alien civilization.

There just is not enough evidence supporting the fact that it isnt just a mesa or butte like here on Earth.        ",4,1,0.9089289903640747

The Face may resemble a human face, but there are also many other things that humans think are faces. One of these landforms that may look like a face is the face on the moon and even clouds can resemble faces. Therefore I believe that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform.

Although it may appear as a face to many people created by aliens, there has been no scientific proof that aliens exist. It's obvious that the Face on Mars is a peninsula or hill landform that may happen to look like a human face. If there was a peninsula or hill landform on Earth that happened to appear as a face, would everyone jump to the assumption of aliens? Then again there is no scientific evidence that aliens don't exist, but aliens are just made up science fiction creatures that people have come to believe are real.

Therefore the Face on Mars is just a peninsula or hill landform that coincidentally happens to appear as a human face. Just because it happens to look like a humans face and its in outer space people jump to the assumption that aliens are the reason behind the Face on Mars. The entire idea of aliens is just a joke humans made up to scare other humans.

e5efc6c,"There have been many question going around about a face shaped rock that was recently found on Mars. Many think that it was aliens, but I mean those are just conspiracy theories. There's no real evidence but either way I'm here to clarify what the face is. I have gotten information form the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

First of all, the Face is being used for people to believe it's a misterious object. Ever since the Face was discovered it has become a pop icon. The article I found said ""The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and has even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" The article also said ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" The only people that are saying anything about the Face and if it's made by aliens are conspiracy theorists.

Also, NASA has captured better pictures but people still believe it was aliens. An article said ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The article also said ""What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms commom around the American West."" NASA took clear picture of the landform and found out that it's just a landform.

Although, the second time NASA took the pictures it was cloudy, so they could be trying to hide something. The text said ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" So NASA could be trying to hide something by taking the pictures during the time when there's that type of weather.

However, NASA wouldn't lie about this kind of discovery because it would also be very helpful for them. The text said ""We felt this was important ot taxpayers,"" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" The article also said ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height and the Face on Mars."" The Face isn't made by aliens or anything of that sort. Even if people wanted to it to be something the Face is just a landform.

In conclusion, the Face is just a landform it's not an alien artifact or anything else. The only people saying it was made by aliens are conspiracy theorists. The Face is just a landform that had the perfect lighting to make it look like a face. I know conspiracy theorists think it's something else but the information and facts are clearly stated.",4,1,0.8460351824760437
e626f3a,"The ""face"" on mars is a natural landform and was not made by aliens. I know this because it's just a rock formation. The second reason is NASA would want there to be life on mars because it would benefit them. Finally because the shadows give the appearance of looking like a face.

My first reason is it's just a rock formation. In the artcle, it says global surveyor flew over Cydonia and snap photos of it. These pictures were 10 times sharper than the original. Also these showed that it was just a natural landform. It is the mar equivalent of a butte or Mesa.

Now I know what some of you are thinking, ""What if NASA is hiding something. Well my next reason is NASA would benefit by finding aliens on mars. In the text it said that while defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an alien civillzation. This shows that they would embrace having found aliens because they could make money. NASA wouldn't be hiding anything because they would be missing out. In the text it even said that authors resoned it would be a good way to engage the public an attract more attention to mars.

Finally, the face only lookes like that because of shadows. The article says the face only comes from shadows. It gave the illusion of having eyes, a mouth, and a nose. People have traveled as far as we could get; with the best camera and saw that it was just a normal rock formation. In face we have many of these same mesa and butte on earth.

The face on mars is is a natural landform and was not made by aliens. This is because it's just a normal rock formation. The next reason is NASA would want there to be life on Mars because it would beneft them. Finally, The ""face"" is formed because of the shadows on the Mesa. For all these reasons the face on mars was not made by aliens, but is just a regular rock formation",4,1,0.8507509827613831
e63006a,"25 years ago, there was an abnormal structure discovered by NASA's Viking 1 Space Shuttle as it was circling Mars to find possible landing sites for it's siter ship Viking 2 when it spotted the abnormal structure. This abnormal sturcture was called the ""Face on Mars"" that stretched out two miles from end to end located in Cydonia. Shortly after it was found, scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

In 1976, the first pictures of the ""Face on Mars"" was taken by NASA's Viking 1, but a few days later NASA unveiled the image for the world to see and told people it was just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" As of May 24, 2001, NASA revealed ""the Face on Mars"" is just a mesa. As the pictures were reveiled on the JPL web site ""the Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all. On April 8, 2001, Mallin's team captured a photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoltuion, each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking 1 photo in 1976. ""If there was an object in this photograph like planes on the ground of Eygptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"", said Garvin.

In conclusion, ""the Face on Mars"" is not real for it it just a natural landform on the Red Planet. ""In the picture it actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common arounf the American West."" says Garvin. Many people believed that this photo was created by aliens but we have pictures and space shuttles out there to prove ""the Face on Mars"" is just a landform on the Red Planet.",2,1,0.878901481628418

I'm a scientist at NASA and the Face, a lot of people seem to think was formed by aliens or is proof of alien life forms, is actually just a natural landform. The Face is just a natural landform because it was a cloudy day on Mars when the spacecraft took the pictures, you would be able to see objects in the pictures if there were any, and the picture actually shows the Martian.

The Face is just a natural landform on the planet of Mars, not something created by alien life forms or evidence of life on Mars. For example, when the pictures were taken, it was a cloudy day on Mars. The clouds casted shadows on the landform to make it look like a face. There were no alien markings. If there were objects in the pictures you would be able to see them. You would be able to see the objects because you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are common around the American West.

Do you still think the Face on Mars was actually created by aliens? Do you still think it is bona fide evidence of life on Mars? The Face is just a natural landform because pictures were taken on a cloudy day, where the clouds could cast shadows on the landform. You would also be able to see any objects in the pictures if there were any. There is a chance of life on Mars because there is water found on Mars.

e6d3293,"So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.

My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters. It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.

My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?

The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. ""It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars."" The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.

My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other. The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?

This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity. ",3,1,0.8601889610290527
e6e7528,"Back in 1976 an image was captured by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In that time technology wasn't as good as it is now. So the so called Face started to spread quickly. Many people thought that this was created by aliens.

Now first of all aliens haven't been proved real yet, so if aliens aren't real then how can people say aliens did it. In the first image taken in 1976 I can understand why people are creating theories. But if you look at the one taken in 2001 you can clearly see that it is a mesa. Even in 1998, when technology was advancing, you can still see that it is a mesa or just even a type of landform.

Like Garvin says ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" and I agree with him completely.

I think that the head was form by itself when the heat from Mars rise and it burn some of the rock and form the big head. I don't think it was made by alien because if they were in Mars they would burn when the sun come or when the heat rise from Mars. If it were made by alien then we would see their foot print or some symbol or marking that is unusual to Earth. The people who was there to take this photo said it was ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west"". It said that on ""April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a picture 10 time sharper then the original Viking photo"". ""There was no alien monument after all"". So, the head was created by landform and if there were alien they would have seen them or take a photo of them but there was none so it was created by landform.

In conclusion, the head that was on Mars was actually created by landform, not by alien because if it was created by alien then they would have seen them when they orbit the Mars and also it is not alien monument it is actually the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west"".

It is just a huge rock that is real, but a shadowing effect gives off an illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth making it look like a human head has been created there purposely. Some people say that an alien could have been the one to make this human head figure, but with the new picture we got that is ten times better than the old one we have been able to prove that there was no alien monument after all.

Even after we have proved that there was no alien who created that, people are still not even satisfied. Some even said they believed that the alien markings could have been hidden by haze. With that being said, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look at it. We once agin got another extraordinary photo of the figure using the cameras maximum resolution. in this picture if anything was there you would have been able to see it in that photo, but there was nothing there to see in that photo that an alien could have been responsible for this random figure.

If you are wondering what the picture did show, it showed the magnificents of a butte or messa, which stands for landforms that are common around the American West.

The Face on Mars is just a natural landform, although some people believe that the Face is bona fide edvidence of life on mars I can insure you its not. I can give three good reasons why I am insisting that this sculpture is just a rock. First of all we had a better camera when we went back to investigate. Second of all we double cheaked our reasch. And third of all both results proved that it indeed was just a landform, much like Americas.

In 1998 we send a special team called the MOC to investigate the Face. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photos back in 1976. These photos came back stating that it was a natural land form. But not everyone was satisfied. At that time the MOC had took the photo it was winter in April '98 on the planet- a cloudy time of the year on mars. The camera might have been fogged.

Two prove ower statement in 2001 we sent the MOC to take a second photo of the Face this time during the planets summer and with an even better camera. This newer camera had higher definition than the other two. When results came back they, again, stated a natural land mark.

As you can see not only did we cheak once but twice both supporting NASA'S claim that ""the Face of Mars"" was just a rock after all.",3,1,0.8647841215133667
e7aaaf1,"For those who believe in Aliens, and believe this face is built by aliens, I have some news, its not and i can argue my point in three different ways. Number one, paragrah 10 sates that if there were anything on the ground the camera would of caught it, number 2 is paragrah 11 talks about the cameras ablity to see anything that would help the research of alien life, and lastly paragrah 7 talking about the natural landform.

First, paragrah 10 talks about the difference of the pictures from 1976-2001 with the different pixels. In the fourth sentence it says "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo"". Earlier in the paragraph it talks about the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, meaning the camera NASA has aren't cheap, they are high quality and could see anything that could resemble any alien life, which will be disccused next.

Secondly, in paragraph 11 it talks about the cameras ablity to see anything on the ground such as shacks planes, as is I said in the previous paragraph with the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, this paragrah also says ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added.""So, if there objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground Egyptian- style prymaids or even small shacks, acould see what they were!"" Which brings us back to the camera being its best of class,if the camera is able to see anything on the ground that would not be visable to the naked eye, then why didn't it see anythng .

I know most of you would argue that they are storing equiment in the face. But, in the picture the only holes are the eyes and the camera could of seen any other entry point at this angle.

Lastly, paragraph 7 revells the picture of the face on mars, this paragraph talks about the research, and the release of the picture. Yes this eariler in the story but it all falls into place, they state they snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original picture, the image was first posted on the JPL webstite showing a NATURAL land form, no alien momument at all. This dosen't ptove anything since they just posted the picture, but the previous statement i made fall into place with this one supporting my facts of no alien life on the palnet mars asscociating with the face

Concluding my argument of no other life form on mars, I hope I one helped you with your facts, changed your idea of the other life form (not saying you have to). I do not 100% disagree with other life forms but for this one I do.",5,1,0.5636124610900879
e7ec99d,"Mars, the Red Planet, has been thought to have lifeforms living on it for many years now, by many people. Yet there is no comfirmed evidence that there is life on Mars, or that there was life on Mars. The ""face"" located in Cydonia, is not a face of anything at all. It is only a mesa. That was naturaly occuring. If there was any life near the ""face"" on Mars, then the Mars Global Surveyor would have found something.

I know what you are thinking. That NASA is hiding the fact that there are lifeforms or where lifeforms on Mars. If there were, then NASA would have told the world by know. It would help NASA if there was life out there in space. The picture that the Viking 1 spacecraft took in 1976, was to low of a resolution to be seen clearly. In 1998 when another Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia the crew snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the origional Viking 1 photos. Revealing that the so called monument was a natural occuring landform. Yet many people like yourself, where not satisfied by this conclusion and thought that NASA was covering up the fact that there is or was alien life on Mars.

NASA then prepared another mission to capture another image of the ""face"". NASA planed this mission for a cloudless sunny day in Cydonia in 2001, so they could get the clearest picture possible. NASA would not risk more money and lives if they already knew that there was life on Mars. It makes no sense. The team that went to capture another photograph, captured one that was the maximum resolution. It would have captured anything that looked out of the ordinary. Including lifeforms and anything they may have left behind.

All of the facts point towards the face being a natural landform and not made by anything but nature. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a mesa which are comonly found in the American West. One photograph showed what looked like a face. The other two photos, which were taken with better cameras at a higher resolution, show a mesa. The facts are showing that the ""face"" is not a face at all it is a naturaly occuring land form.

If there was any signs of life, past or present. The Mars Global Surveyor would have found something in 2001. All of the facts point to having no lifeforms build this stucture on Mars. If there was any thing out of the ordinary with this mesa then it possibly could have been built by extraterrestrial life. But there was and is nothing out of the ordinary with the mesa. It is the same type of landform that occurs in the Western part of the United States of America. NASA would not cover up alien life if it was benifical. It is like you burning your money. It helps no one. There is no life on Mars and the ""face"" that you saw in 1976 is not a ""face"" made by lifeforms. It is a naturaly occuring landform.",5,1,0.8446778059005737

Our boss, who is usually quite loud, is unusually quiet, giving us the idea that this is very serious. As he clears his throat, everyone finds a seat and settles down. I take a seat in the back right corner so that I can see everyone expressions during the meeting.

""Hello,"" our boss says loudly, starting his speech, ""and welcome. I apologize for this unexpected meeting. Trust me, I wasn't very thrilled to be here either. But I have gotten some unexpected images from Viking 1. It is very... strange. So without further adue...."" He takes a remote like thing and turns on the projector, showing an image on the wall. As I look around the room from my corner, I see a number of expressions, some confused, some amused, some even a bit worried. But one expression stands out. A new guy, I'd say he's been here for about a few weeks, is two seats next to me, mumbling something under his breath. I give him a strange look. He seems frightened. As his mumbles get louder, more people start to stare. ""Th-The aliens did this.. I... I know it!"" The room bursts into laughter. I give a few chuckles as well. I mean, come on now. Aliens?

""Alright, alright. Settle down now. Have some respect. Let him give his point of view,"" the boss says. I guess he has a point. As the room gets quiet again, all the attention goes towards Mr. New Guy. He begins speaking. ""You guys think it's funny, but think about it! If you think that in the WHOLE universe, we are the only form of life, you're ignorant.""

Is this guy serious?

""Everyone knows that aliens are smart! They could've easily built that landform to mock humans!""

I can't take this nonsense anymore. I casually raise my hand, waiting for the majority to acknowledge it. When I feel that I've gotten enough peoples attention, I begin to talk. ""Listen. I understand that we may not be the only life form in the universe, but do you really think that aliens built that? You said it yourself man. It's a landform. A natural landform."" I slowly get up and make my way to the wall where the image is being displayed. ""Do you see this?"" I point the ""eye"" of the landform. ""This is a shadow. Nothing more, nothing less. As well as this other ""eye"" and the rest of the darkness making it seem like this landform has a face. It's just the angle of Viking 1 and where it was when the picture was taken. It just so happens that it looks like a human face. Now I agree, it is kind of weird. But Viking 1 takes a lot of photos. Don't you think there would be at least a few pictures with aliens making it? Sorry man, but your theory just isn't adding up."" There is a small appause as I walk back to my seat.

Mr. New Guy doesn't look very happy. He looks a bit relieved though. ""Well,"" boss starts speaking, ""I suppose we have our answer already. Just a simple landform. Alright guys. You all are dismissed. Have a nice night."" He begins packing his things. I get up and head out. As I get in the car I sigh. ""Well, that was a waste of time.""",2,1,0.34290945529937744

Another reason is because you can really ress it unless there are shadows and your rihg tover it. My last reason is that Mars Global Surveyor Cyldonia took pictures of the Face and proved that it is natural.

The shadows give is it's face because there is bumps on mars, so that when shadows go a certain direction, it casts shadows and makes it look like a human face on Mars. In the article it says "" A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...whihc resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illision of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The author reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and atrract attention to Mars."" This goes on to prove my next point.

Marc Global Surveyor Cyldonia has taken better picture of what they so call ""the Face"" on Mars.

My last reason is that you can really see it unless there is a shadow or you look at it at a exact angle. The article proved this by saying this "" Neerthe less, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enought for a second look.

Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meter, compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This is proving that with a better camera and a better view that it was naturally made and you have to look at it from certain angles to see the face.

Yes, I agree with NASA that ""the Face"" is nothing but a natural landform, and not something created by life on a different planet. My reasons being the shadows are the only thing that gives it it's face, Mars Global Surveyor took better pictures of the landform, and you can't really see it unless you look from a certain agngle or direction.

e825381,"In 1976, a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars. The Viking 1 was taking pictures of possible landings for Viking 2, but instead it spotted a shadowy human face. Many people belived that it was the Face of an alien artifact while scientists say that it's a landform on Mars. I believe that the Face is a natural landform not a alien artifact.

To begin with, when Viking 1 first took those pictures they were shodowy and quite blurry too. I first thought that it was the Face of a alien artifact, but I then

realized that it was not. It was just another Martian mesa that has unusual shadows around it. It's

a huge rock that resembles to a human head. Of course it's formed by shadows, but the shadows give a illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time to snap more pictures. Michael Malin snapped pictures that were 10 times sharper than the original. This time the pictures was less shadowy. The picture was realeased into a website

and it was just a natural landform not a alien monument. In the picture that was taken in 1998 has a better quality, but people belived that it was a cloudy time of that year on the Red planet.

Soon pictures were taken again in 2001. This time the images were new

high-resolution and 3D altimetry which were from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft. The picutres reveals thats it is actaully a mesa! You may argue with me but the picture is a digital image which is 3 times bigger than the pixels size. For example, if there was a small shack on the ground you could see what they were.

Many people had hoped that the original pciture was the Face of an alien artifact, but when NASA said that it was not people argued back with them. NASA tooks pictures of it in 1998 to make people belive that it was just a mesa, but people still didnt belive. So in 2001, NASA took another picture which was digital image and it proved that the image of the Face was just a mesa.",4,1,0.8523624539375305
e86e8a9,"As most of you may most likely know, whether it be through media or a friend, the 1976 Viking 1 spacecraft photographed what appeared to be a face in the Cydonia region on Mars. This so called face was created by shadows of rocks that made the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. In actuality, that's all this face is: an illusion. Many of us scientists are convinced that this ""Face on Mars"" is only just a mesa, although some of my fellow peers (as well as conspiracy theorists) are convinced that this face is a sign of alien life. In order to disprove the notion that the Face on Mars is in fact a sign of alien life, we (NASA) photographed the same mesa in the Cydonia region once more on April 5, 1998 using the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) which had a higher resolution camera than the Viking 1. This should have convinced the public and conspiracy theorists that the so called Face on Mars was only an illusion, as the photograph showed no face and only vague rocks and indents in the surface of the mesa, but no avail. They claimed that since it was cloudy when the picture was taken, it was covering up what the Face on Mars was supposedly hiding. So we set out to prove the conspiracy theorists wrong once and for all. On April 8, 2001 a final photograph was taken of the Face on Mars. This time, we used an even higher resolution camera (at 1.56 meters per pixel) on the MGS. What appeared was the exact same picture as we had taken in 1998. Alas, no one was satisfied and to this day conspiracy theorists still question that the Face on Mars is a mesa. Actually, the mesa that had the Face on Mars on it resembles many of the mesas we have here on Earth. As Garvin stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". Another piece of evidence for the face being a mesa is that in the 2 photos following the original in 1976, the face was no where to be seen. If th conspiracy theorists were right, than the MGS photographs would have shown a face and even alien symbols as some theorists claimed those would be some of the markings in the face. Unfortunately for them, all that showed up on the images were rocks and indents. In conclusion, base on all of the evidence gathered throughout 25 years about the Face on Mars, all evidence points to it being a mesa.

Man people believe that the face on mars was created by aliens because of the theroist but NASA wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars but there is no sign of one.

Scientist believe the face wwas just another Martian mesa, which was common enough around Cydonia.

Scientist also took photos called viking photos of this face in 1976, 1998, and 2001. With new high-resolution images and 3D altiemetryfrom NASA's mars global survey spacecrafts reveal the face on mars for what it really is a mesa.

People at NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars but facts show that the face was just part of the Earth's geography. For instance people believe that the aliens built the face to show they are living, but one camera team took a picture ten times sharper then the original viking photos. MAny people were waiting for the results and the results showed that it was just a natural land form and not an alien creature after all.

Not everyone was satisfied with the photos, this was because the face was located in a place where it was a cloudy time of year. people believed that under the wispy clouds they would find alien life. so on a cloudless sumer day they took another photo to show there was no sign of alien life.

In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a peron or as MGS says a ""a Viking photo."" I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.

I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. In paragraph 2, the author states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear. The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing. In the introduction, it says, ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa."" If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.

In conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren't even real, that hasn't benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want.

e8af119,"""The Face on Mars"" appears as you search the universe with a satellite. What is this thing, and who has created it? As a scientist, I believe that this monstorous thing is just a landform created by thousands of years of evolution. The Face on Mars can be proven to be a natural landform because it appears to be a mesa with unusual shadows, a sharp picture proved that it was just a landform, and it's very hard to locate this Face.

For starters, Martian mesas are very common around Cydonia. This one wasn't a huge surprise, although it had unusual shadows that gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. After ""NASA unveled the image for all to see, it was noted that it was only a 'huge rock formation.'"" Through this passage we can observe that the Face is only a natural landform.

Secondly, ""On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Many people thought that it might be something created by aliens and were waiting for the arrival of the evidence. The picture proved that the Face wasn't some ancient alien sculpture, but instead, a natural landform.

Additionally, The Face on Mars isn't any easy landform to find. Jim Garvin says, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia. In fact it's hard work."" For the span of twenty-five years they only caught three glimpses of it. Garvin also noted that they don't pass over the face very often. If an alien had created this monument, then they would have made it easy to see and very noticeable. This is not how the Face is made.

Some would say that perhaps alien marking were hidden by the haze. However, any alien smart enough to make a geographical feature, would be smart enough to make it big and bold. Any alien feature would be seen clearly, even through a haze of clouds. So, in fact, this feature is just a natural landform.

In conclusion, as a scientist at NASA, I can assume that this Face is not a monument built by aliens. We have concluded that it is a natural landform. the reasons for our conclusion land on the evidence of a picture that was taken, the fact that mesas are common around Cydonia, and finally, it's hard to locate this face, which would be unlike anything an alien creates. By looking at the image and the information that has been provided to us, we can conclude that this Face is most certainly a natural landform.",4,1,0.922504186630249
e8c4fce,"I think that it is just a landform becuse. When I look at the pictures that are shown in the passage from 1976, 1998, and 2001. They are all different.

In paragraph 8 it says that not everyone was satisfied. They say the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. So the mission controllers prepared to look again. ""it's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work.' Mars Global Sureyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks stright down and scans the planet like a fax machine in a narrow 2.6 km-wide strips.""

They say that The Face on Mars has become a pop icon. it has starred in a Hollywood film, and appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows. Even haunted grocery store checkout lines fir 25 years. I think that it is really amazing that they talk about things on mars because no one really talks about it.

Some believed that the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at red Planet in Sept. 1997,eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.

So what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa. Landforms are common around the American West. ""it reminds me most of middle Butte in the Snake river plain of idaho,"" says Garvin. "" Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Some still don't believe that it could just be a landform, but I am going to try to give you multiple examples so you can see what we saw.

The first part of the article is information about what we found. It mentions how everyone made a big commotion about the Face. Who wouldn't though? We don't see this often, but it is in fact a butte or mesa. Back in 1976 we didn't get the best picture. So we got closer tried to get the best shot possible. After we got closer, also in 1976, we ended up with a success and get a clear photo. Yes, it did look like a face, also depending on which angle you look at it though. Some say it looked like it resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. It took a lot of research to realize what it was, we had an idea but we weren't so sure in the beginning.

We have people believing that NASA is lying. I can assure you we are not lying. With our budget, we wish there was an ancient civilization. This would be a breakthrough! So for everyone skeptic, and the people thinking we are lying it isn't true. We put so much money and time into researching this. It isn't an easy proccess. It's actually really hard, you have things you have to find out. We also didn't want to give out false information. We had to let people know the truth and that is why we didn't just tell everyone there was a face (landform) on Mars right away.

Eventually it led to the media. The Face was all anyone was talking about. It was everywhere. In the article it talks about how it became a ""pop icon."" It talks about how this ended up starring in a Hollywood film. It appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. It was all people would talk about in the grocery lines as well, or as the article calls it, ""haunted grocery store checkout lines."" This went on for 25 years. This was a very big conspiracy, well that's what some wanted to believe. Since it was everywhere and there were so many rumors about it, this got the people who were big conspiracy theorists all wound up. No matter what information we presented them with, they just didn't want to believe, they were feeding into their own opinions and basing everything off of the untrue rumors. There are many people who still don't believe us to this day.

We are almost 100% sure this is a landform. We have looked very, very closely at these pictures, and it has changed overtime. If you look in the article, at the very beginnning they have three pictures with different years, the first was taking in 1976. The second was in 1998 and the third was in 2001. If you look closely they aren't the same, it's a landform, it changed. We have also looked at things on earth to try to compare. We have landforms in the midwest that look like this as well. Sure some don't look exactly the same as ""the Face"" but that's because they are landforms. Landforms are different. Things erode and change overtime. In the article it says that Garvin had looked at some things as well and he said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" and ""That's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is how he sees it, Which is also fact, there is a Plain in Idaho that he thinks is similar. The lava dome may be something that could have occurred with the mesa on Mars too.

In conclusion, I am writing this and including many reasons why the Face was not created by aliens because I am giving the truth. I have given more than enough reasons and so many different facts. I hope you believe me along with NASA. It's just a landform. It changes overtime, it just happened to look like a face. We get that it looked like a face, but when you think about it, it also depends on how you look at it. It was weird to a lot of people. We are sorry for any false information that was brought up. Just know that false information wasn't from us. These are the facts, I hope I have convinced you. ",4,1,0.9027764797210693

The technology we have now in days is very advanced and most likely we would have found them by now. You scientist at Nasa believe that there was an ancient civilization on Mars from these aliens and what they supposeply created. Not too many people agree with Nasa.

You scientist at Nasa have found what is called the ""Face on Mars"" and believe it to look like a face.Nasa has shared these photos and has caused a lot of attention towards Mars. The ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. It has appeared in Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines! People shared their opinions on if they really thought aliens could have done this, but it turned out Nasa was wrong. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform.

Now all of you scientist at Nasa might be dissapointed that there are no such things as aliens, but what brought you to this conclusion in the first place? There has never been a form of any kind of evidence that aliens are real so why say aliens caused the ""Face on Mars""? Just making sure that all you scientist are updated at Nasa by saying the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform. Thank you for the concern, but quite frankly you are wrong.

e9269d6,"Everyone knows what landforms look like. So why when everyone sees an object on Mars they automatically assume it is a face. It is just a natural landform on a different planet then everyone else. Just like if some random person lived on the moon which is not possible, and they see a face looking object, does not mean it is a face. It could just be crater holes. Craters are a reasonable and convincing explaniation. A crater could have hit Mars without anyone knowing. Convincing someone that the Face is just a natural landform is very hard because NASA has got everyone thinking different.

If everyone is thinking what NASA is saying how is anyone suppose to figure out what it really is? Everybody need to convince each other that it is just a landform. Who would believe that anyone is living on Mars. After all, there is not any oxygen there, so how would any humans survive? Very few "" Scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact."" Even scientists do not believe that it is any type of living thing on Mars. If scientists do not believe why should anyone else. After all, they are the ones studying the planets and atmosphere for us.

When scientists study our planets they also study our moon. Our moon has a bunch of craters. Which means they study craters too. Scientists know craters well enough to know that they can hit anywhere at anytime. Craters can make any type of shape or size even if you do take a quick picture of it. Pictures could be mistaken. It could make things bigger, or even look like some other things. Like if you took a picture of the "" Face"" "" What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" It even looks like landforms. Just like the ones here on Earth in the West. Once they cleared up the picture taking in 2001 they saw that it looked liked landforms here. So it is very likely that it could have just been a mistake. If the scientist do not believe that it is, or if it looks like landforms.

All the information in the article and in this essay shows some good points. Landforms could form anywhere. One could have just struck Mars one day. Or the camera could have just taken a mistaken picture. Either way scientists do not think it is any sign of a living breathing thing. No oxygen is on Mars so we would die instantly. Earth can not load some oxygen and there are not trees in Mars which means no oxygen. No life, no humans, no aliens.    ",4,1,0.831240713596344

He said ""show me the proof than EVAN!!!"". So I then went to get my boss and asked him if i could see the pictures and articles about the face on mars. He said i couldn't see them right away because he needed them so i gad a wait a whole day. The next day my boss handed me the paper and i was so exited to go to John's face and show him the facts.

The first things i showed him were the 3 pictures because it shows how it looked over all those years. Then i showed what NASA said, which was ""Huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars.

It was a pop icon, it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!!! I told john ""Even only a little bit of scientists believe the face was an alien articraft.'

e9307c9,"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.

The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth."" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.

This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.

Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien momument after all.

While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia. They just do not pass the face very often.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.

They used the cameras highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Garvin.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."" He added. So weather or not theFace is an alien landform or a rock formation, NASA does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupiclatiy to the Red Planet. However, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive.

The landform could've been foemed when the planet was formed. The face is just a illusion from shadows, from how the planet is tilted towards the sun. NASA took photos of the supposibly face with a high-definition camera, that was more powerful then the one Viking 1 had. The face is just a lava dome that takes the form of a landform. If there was a airplane, hut, or a Egyptian-style pyramid we would be able to see it with no problem, and be able to make out what it is.

Since there is no sign of life on Mars, it had to be something natural. There are things called Martian Mesa. A Martian Mesa is very common, it's shadows around Cydonia, but this shadow happen to like like a face. People started to believe that there was life on Mars but that wasn't what was going on. If there was life on Mars there would be signs other than a shadow, we've done pictures of Mars before, why would something show up now?

There were no aliens or life on Mars. NASA took a picture of the face again with a camera that was ten times sharper than the original, which reveales that there is no aliens on Mars, it was just a natural landform. People disagree but Cydonia is hard to target, it's hard work. And Cydonia is very common, it's natural shadowing on Mars and most likely other places too. Some people still have their disbelief, but research has shown it to be a natural landform that is very common around Cydonia. ",3,1,0.8177757263183594
e962f04,"I am writing this paragraph about a argumentive essay and to say that the face that was found on Mars was not a alien it's a natural born landform.

The face that was found on Mars was not a alien, I think that because it had the shape on a human face and a human face does not look anything like a alien face, they are two different types of faces.

The reason is on May 24, 2001 when the face was spotted it even says "" When it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face"", it does not say anything about it looking like a alien face.

Then, the NASA opened up the image for everyone to see this caption had a huge rock resemble they said, "" which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving a illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"". This little sentence that was stated when they took a good look at the picture pretty much states that they is a possiblity that it could be a alien head but a very low chance, so most likely this head is a human head (90%). This little sitiuation attracted a nice amout of attension to Mars.

Also, on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his camera got 10 good pictures of the face the pictures were better than the vikings pictures so now they can really look into the picture. Then the pictures that were taken a lot of people were waiting on them, and finally they first appered on a JPL web site, the picture that first appered on JPL's web site revealed a natural landform. They said, "" There was no alien monument after all "", so that means that the head was into a human head and it was not a alien head. So they were planning a date to take more pictures just so they can look at it and make sure that there evidence is not wrong and they said everything right.

In Conclusion, I wrote this argumentative essay to explain how the head that was found on Mars is a human head not a alien head. It so happend to be that it was a human head and it had thne natural landform to even show that it was a human head. After all it takes alot of research to get things done and have them done the right way in science, but it was a human head.",3,1,0.8452088236808777
e965607,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens and we know this because if there was life on Mars we would have seen more evidence of it then just the Face, and there are many Martian mesas in the area where we found the Face so it is most likely to be another mesa with shadows that make it look like a human face. Like the many types of different natural landmarks we have on Earth.

We have taken more pictures of the Face on Mars that don't show any evidence of alien life on Mars. The most recent being the one we took on April 8, 2001 on a camera that takes pictures with better resolution that helps us see more then just the Face but also anything else that could be around the Face, like, pyramids, airplanes, and small shacks. The picture showed something that looked more like the landforms that are common here around the American West. And the picture was take on a cloudless day in Cydonia so it is more clearly seen in the photo.

The Face on Mars is just another landmark like the ones we have on Earth and was not created by aliens because we have more evidence that proves so. Like how if there was alien life on Mars we would have to have seen something that shows that anything could be living there on Mars. The Face on Mars looks more like it has shadows that have made it have the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.",3,1,0.9233017563819885
e9a2fca,"Some say that the face found on the surface of Mars is just that, a face. But others would say that the Face is only a mesa with shadows that cause it to appear as though a face were there. But who is correct? I honestly do not believe in aliens so I would have to say that the latter of people are the ones who have their stories straight.

The first pictures of the Face went to NASA in 1976. Most everyone was convinced that this Face was proof of aliens and martian life. Then another picture of the Face came in, in 1998. This picture showed a little bit more of how maybe, just maybe, this was not actually martian life. Then in 2001 when the final picture came in and showed everyone how this Face was simply a mesa.

But still people say that NASA warped this picture and that NASA wants us to no proof of alien life forms. But if NASA had proof of other life forms, they would get more sponsor ship and it would be better for them. NASA would want us to know without a shadow of a doubt that other life forms are out there. It truley would be beneficial for their company and for the future of their company. So, for people out there to say that NASA is lying to us and that the Face is real and that NASA does not want us to know, that is absurd. There is also a people group who would say that because there was a haze in that region of Mars the day that the 2001 picture was taken, that the picture did not capture the whole thing or the complete Face in all that it is. But I think that these people are simply grasping for straws.

There are many theories about the Face on Mars, but there is really no way to know who is correct. The only person who can truley know is God. People today can put stress on one tiny little happening and focus on that. Whether or not the Face is real is a pretty big question with a lot of answers but in the grand scheme of things, this small little detail dos not matter as much as some people seem to think that it does.

There is not to much evidence leaning either way, but I feel that it leans more twards being natural. We have not landed and investigated it yet. I have some evidence to support my idea. After reading this essay, I am sure that you will understand my point of view.

I belive that the face of mars is natural. First, It is just a large rock formation that could have just occured naturally. Second, There is no other sign of life on mars. Third, It only resembles a face, it is not perfect. It is still controversial because we cannot examin it face to face. We only have the images that the space shuttles took from 1976 through 2001. Just because it is a formation on a different planet, it doesn't mean it was created by aliens.

When God created the universe, did He say that He created little green men to live on the different planet? No. He said that the only intelligent being, with His breath in our lungs, that he created was use. Although, He did say He created the wonders of this universe. I would call the face a wonder, wouldn't you? God created one planet with the perfect design for life, and that planet is our home Earth.

I think that ,because on April 5, 1998 Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the Face on Mars ten times sharper than the orginal picture in 1976 by the Viking. My second reason why I don't believe that aliens created the Face on Mars, is becase on April 8, 2001 Malin's team took a picture of the Face on Mars. Not only is believing that the Face on Mars was created by aliens is illogical, but many pictures have been taken, there is still not a single sign of aliens.

My first reason why I don't think the aliens created the Face on Mars is because the MOC team snapped a photo of the Face on Mars ten times sharper, so you could see more clearly. You could see clearer than the orginal Viking photos. When the web surfers saw the picture, all they could see was a natural landform. Not any sign of aliens. My piont is that the clearer the pictue gets, the less it reveals that aliens created the Face on Mars.

According to the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars'', ""Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'' Garvin told them. Compared to the 1976 photo taken by the Viking, the newer camera spans 1.56 meters for each pixel. This camera allows you to discern objects in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. Garvin told the author of ''Unmasking the Face on Mars.'' People who believe that aliens created the Face on Mars can not argue that it was cloudy in that picture for it was taken in the summer, unlike the previous picture. The picture that Malin's team took had no signs of aliens.

My last reason as why not aliens did not create the Face on Mars is because it's illogical. Using common sense you should be abe to see in all of these pictures that there is no sign of aliens. Photo after Phote prove that aliens did not create the Face on Mars.

All three of these reasons are why I don't think aliens created the Face on Mars. I believe that it's just natural landform.",4,1,0.8846060633659363

In some ways I guess it could look like it was created by them. But in the end it was just a natural landform. A great deal of scientists strongly believe that it was not an alien.

An enormous head nearly two miles end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when they saw the photo. But common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Oodles of people started paying more attention to this story once it got out there.

ea18a54,"Many have claimed that the human face found on Mars is an alien artifact, but how certain are they. According to NASA, the Face on Mars is just a rock formation that resembles the face of a human, but others may disagree. I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. To further investiate this topic, we will begin by analyzing how the Face was formed and how it compares to lanforms on Earth, where it was located, and what causes others to believe that it is an alien artifact.

Some might believe that the so called ""alien artifact"" was lefted behind by aliens, but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth."" This image was even compared to natural landforms found on Earth. According to the passage, the picture portrays the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. The passage also claims that the image reminds him of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" and that the Face on Mars is about he same height of an isolated mesa- which is a landform.

The Face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude during the winter of April 1998. This time of the year was also considered to be the cloudiest time of year on the Red Planet. The fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time of year on Mars can affect the turn out of this theory. A few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, and photographing the Cydonia became one of the biggest priorities for NASA. As soon as the Viking mission was ended, the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated that they ""photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it."" I believe they did this to clarify their foundings.

As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why. As the photo of the Face on Mars was being taken, it was claimed that the ""camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face,"" and according to skeptics, ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again. Garvin states that "" It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" and that its hardwork. Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is ""bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide."" Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions.

In conlusion, after analyizing the data and research given, I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Others may disagree, but it is all about your interprutation on the topic, and hopefully the evidence used to support my claims did just that.        ",4,1,0.8934918642044067

I say that the ""Face on Mars"" is in fact, a natural landform. There is no alien markings to be seen from a picture. For example, """"As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the groud or Egyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

So, if there were alien markings on this natural landform you would be able to see them. This was stated by Jim Garvin who is a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The picture uses the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Many people said from the photo took in 1998, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" The photo in 1998 was taken on a cloudy winter day on Mars and caused a haze to appear over the camera. By going in 2001 on a nice sunny day on Mars, the picture was clear and easy to see. You can tell in the picture that there is no alien markings of any kind. The picture was took with great resolution and couldn't be better.

In conclusion, there could be a possibility of aliens making this natural landform but, it could also just be a natural landform. It should not be famous for a conspiracy theory that it was made by aliens, simply of its shape. This landmark, looking like a human face, is just a natural landform.    ",3,1,0.8181995153427124

NASA has already created scientific technology for this reason. They would want to get the best looking picture and the most acccurate one. The acticle states, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.""

Each pixil spanned 1.56 meters, compard to Vikings 43 meters per pixel

NASA has been specifically designed to explore outer space and to discover what was there. They have been working even before 1976, Thats more than 40 years! They have only had a number of break throughs, proving that NASA would not hold back information about ancient civilizaions or alien lifeform because it would be a great breakthrough. The defenders of the NASA budget even wished there was an ancient civilization on mars. There was a degree of suprise for mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared. They were fascinated by what they saw.

The alien conspiercy believers may reject the pictures and say they have been tampered with. NASA would not do that, however. They have already spent loads of money for this project and made all the equipment. They would not go through all that trouble just to lie to the public. NASA also took may pictures with their instruments from many angles and different views. They are high resolution photographs and they even have 3D alimetry, according to the article ""Unmasking the Face of Mars.""

Overall, NASA is an important space project that is honest and truthful about their work. They prove their claims with scientific facts and photos. They have the brains, tools, and budget that allows them to do that.

Since the discovery of the form, it has been in movies, books, and radio talk shows.

The Martian mesa is the term used for the landform. It is very common to find them on Mars in the region of Cydonia. The Martian mesa was naturally formed, but with its shadows, it looks much like a face. In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor was close enogh to actually see if there were any alien monuments and turns out that there wasn't any.

Here at NASA we recieved a lot of attention when the ""Face"" was discovered. If the landform was actually created by aliens, why would we try to hide it? The landform had no monumemts near it when looked at by the Surveyor. ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" People wanted there to be something because it would benefit us.

In the end, the landform was found to be a Martian mesa. There are many mesa's in the region of Cydonia and that's a part of how we found out how it was a natural landform. Also the Surveyour verified that there wasn't any other monuments near the landform. If there was any life on Mars we would want to tell the people so they can be intrested in the activity at NASA, but for now there has not been found any life activiy on Mars.

ea9c6be,"We at NASA are going to take this topic head on starting with you. We are going to try to make you think different about the ""alien landform"" you believe in. I will be the person you will tell about your theory and I will try to change you belief on the whole idea and if you don't it is just your loss. I will admit I would have loved it to have been an alien monument to some sort of king or ruler too, so we could of seen it more than what it was if it really was an alien monument. That is besides the point here that it is a natural land form like the mesas we have here on Earth.

The first picture had a terrible resolution of 43 meters per pixel! That is completely unaccepltable in today's terms for resolution. The first picture in 1976 was only speculated to be an alien monument was due to the shadows on the land and not the actual characteristics of the land. In 1998 the picture could have been altered due to fog, but in 2001 a clear picture proved that the ""face"" on the mesa was just nothing to be excited about. Also if it was some sort of landmark of an ancient civilization you probably could have seen houses or shacks somewhere near it. Also why would we cover up an amazing dicovery that could benefit us in the long run with more funding and credibility.

To put down the truth your theory is more like a thought than an actual theor a this point due to the facts that already prove that it is a mesa a lot like our in on earth. You have to support your statement with much more than an outdated pickture taken about 40 years ago and just accept the facts that are in your face laid out right now the unaccuracy f the first picture, the shadows only showing that if could have been a face, and how why we would cover up soming thing that could get us more publicity to the public eye and more funding. So I hope this discussion changed your mind anout this whole thing and if it didn't you are a stubborn person. So I hope this is the only time we have to correct you.        ",3,1,0.6593276262283325

If we are going to say that the object was made by aliens then we need more evdince not just that one object because one object doesnt mean anyhting with out more things but the planet is able to form something just buy when it is moving and that we have evedince on that but we dont have evedince that an alein made that object and we wont know until we can find more objects just like this one,until then we just know that Mars made this object that NASA found.",1,1,0.6945651769638062
eaf94fd,"The face on mars has been a topic for argument since its discovery in 1976. You might say that it is far to realistic to not have been created by intellegent life, but if there were any kind of alien carvings to sugest that, we would've seen it using the MGS image. We mush firmly conclude that the face was not created by any kind of inteligent extraterrestrial life form.

NASA released the photos originally to drum uo buzz aroung their programs. It worked most definitely, but the attention created sceptices. This led to NASA going out of their way to get a better shot of it, hopeing that this will silence the doubters, However this was a grueling task. Eventually though they found pretty substantial evedence that it was just a rock formation.

The face was initially discovered May 24, 2001 and ever since conspiracy theorists have run wild with the idea that it was made by aliens. The theory states that it was creatd by intelegent life, but NASA has been trying to cover it up and hide its true nature. As stated before this has no foundation because if Intelegent life was found on Mars if would only benifit NASA by drumming up a lot of money for research. Meaning the theory is unlikely.

Using advanced immaging they took pictures of the area that concluded the face was just a oddly shaped rock. However, it is a peculiar shape,but Middle Butte in Utah stands tall in a nearly barren landscape and that has been proven scientifc fact.

The face became something to rave about. It was such an important part in our pop culture that it even stared in a movie. The face will always facinate us. It is remerkable just how much the formation resembles a human face. Perhaps there will always be sceptics, but almost everything can be questioned. That is what is so great about humanity.

The face was not created by intelegent life. Even though that would be amazing. It is just a annother Martian mesa. The truth behind something like this might even be more miraculous than the fiction. Just think about how a planet can create something so beautiful without craftsmen and artisans for help. We may not know about aliens yet, but they certainly did not create this landform.

eb1e42c,"Have you heard of ""The Face on Mars""? Do you believe that it is said to be created by aliens? Have you been told that it was said to resemble an Egyptian Pharaoh? We will find out whether or not this ""Face"" is created by aliens or just some sort of landform.

There has not been any evidence or information that aliens excist. These landforms are common around Cydonia. The usual shadows made it out to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. We thought it was important to taxpayers, so we took another photo when we could get a good shot in. We snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origanal, but still, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. This is just one factor that the ""Face"" was not created by aliens.

Recently in 2001, we took a picture so maximized that we would have seen something. We did not. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras maximum resolution. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If there were objects in the picture such as Egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks, we would have seen what they are. Our maximized picture from Mars Global Surveyor helped provide facts to prove that it was not created by extraterestrial life.

The ""Face"" is similar to mesas' around the American west. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa. Garvin states that it even reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. He says it is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as ""The Face on Mars"". With this fact we have proven that it is just a landform.

Since ""The Face on Mars"" is not really created by aliens and is just a natural landform, we can only hope for different evidence that aliens do excist. No evidence in our photos showed up that there are aliens. The photo taken by the MGS has also proven no excistence of alien life. When we found out that it resembled an American mesa, we knew that was all it was.

eb546c7,"~Intro~

The alien monument you see in the photo in the story is a fake. Let me tell you why it is a fake. NASA only calls this thing a huge rock formation. If this was really an alien face NASA would have kept it hidden and would not have called it an huge rock formation. After a while, web surfers found that it was not a alien monument after all. This face would have really been kept top secret if true.

~body~

If this alien face was really real, that means that if it was so easy to find the first time with no problems, they can find this same alien face again. But, they couldnt find it a second time. NASA say they had diffuclty being able to find it again, which means that this is not true in any way.

~conclusion~

If anything ever like this was found it would be secret and people would have been sent out to search for the alien monument. So I believe that something like this is very untrue. This would not be put out to the world for everyone to see. No one would have knew about this if this was really true.This alien monument is a fake, it was just to get the people attention.",2,1,0.6790274381637573
eb690f4,"In this essay I will be writing an argumentative essay over ""The Face on Mars"" theory. This is a very argumentative subject that can have two sides to itt based on the factual evidence in the passage.""The Face on Mars"" was consider to have been made by alien lifeform. ""The Face on Mars"" is 2 miles long and is a major pop icon.

I think ""The Face on Mars"" is just a huge rock formation that was formed by the planet's weathering and erosion from nearby rocks. Since this planet has a rain season and has a very windy winter, it could've been made by weathering and erosion. Another thing that makes me believe that the face is just a rock is because the dark eyes, nose, and mouth look like shadows from the camera and the sun. One last thing about the face is that if alien lifeform made this why woud they make it 2 miles wide? This has just been one side of the argument, I will write the rest.

I think that this face is made by alien lifeform because it really looks a face. This face could've possibly been a temple or worshiping place for these lifeforms long ago. It could've been a tomb for their leader or king that might've died. If these aliens were going to make a rock this big and that wide it would be for someone or something to catch it's eye. So aliens could've made this or they might not have.

I think that ultimately this is just a coincidence because if aliens are real or were real we would have got aa picture of one or saw some remains of one. And the rock is probably just a mesa or a big landform that was made by weathering and erosion. The face of the rock is most likely just shadows from the camera angle and the sun. And another thing, when the camera passed over the mesa, it was a cloudy and rainy day, making the camera lens wet.

I think that the rock is a mesa. The proof is in the article and it would have been noticed in the pictures if there was aliens living on Mars. So the non-alien side wins this argument over this one. The rock is not a face it is a normal rock.          ",3,1,0.8332573771476746
eb8206b,"Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called ""Face"" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows. The ""Face"" is just an ordinary landform on Mars with unusual shadowing because of recent pictures taken of the natural landform, scientific evidence, and measurements taken.

To start, NASA has taken recent picture of Cydonia in 2001 that shows it is just a natural landform that has developed on the Red Planet Mars. ""On April 8. 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degreesto center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel inv the best 1976 Viking photo."" (p. 10). This shows that NASA has gotten a clear photo of the Face with much better photo quality then the first time iit was photographed.

As discussed before, NASA has taken a new and better quality photo of the Face in Cydonia. Using our scientific equiopment at NASA, we have proven just how much better the resolution is on the new phototgraph taken is. """"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,"" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gtround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""" (p. 11). This quote from the article shows it has been scientifically proven there is no markings, indentations, or objects around the Face that would make it be a human skull.

Finally, NASA compares the Face landform with similar landforms on Earth in America. The scientist compares the Face with a landform called a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West. ""it reminds me of Middle Buttle in the Snake ZRiver Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" (p. 12). This uses a real-life example and measurements to compare the two landforms. The scientist Garvin poinmts out that both landforms--the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and the Face on Mars-- are around the height and shape,

On the contrary, some people believe that the face is """"Bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists"" (p. 5). In defense, NASA has scientifically proven the ""Face"" is just a natural landform created on Mars. ""What the picture really shows is the Martien equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" (p.12).

In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.",5,1,0.8392534255981445

When you take a look at this structure it does look like a humans face. Then again, I dont think it is an alien monument because, from how far you look at it and how far they took pictures from it. I don't think aliens could have made a face a couple miles long, it would have to take years to do this. Anyhow, I do believe there was life on the planet, I know there was water, because they have lots of craters, canyons, and mountains.

My conclusion is, they were formed by natural occurances. As in the passage they compared the face to some features in the American West such as, Middle Butte, and Snake River Plain of Idaho in the West. These conlusions matched the face up to natural formation. The face formation is known as a messa or a plataeu.",1,1,0.8361446857452393

First, when we take a look at the land formation the first thing most people would see is a face. This is an illusion formed by shadows giving an alomst human face, the shadows clearly give an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

Secondly when Nasa took a picture zoomed up much closer to the image of the face it was actually showing the Martain equivalent of a butte or messa. These are all very common, natural landformations on our planet. They used a digital image 3 times bigger then the pixel size.

ebd0e73,"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took photos of Mars, as many as they could for their sister ship Viking 2. It spotted a likeness of a human face, it was nearly 2 miles long from a reigon of Mars called Cydonia. The appereance of this supposible face caused a lot of suprise from NASA and common people. Scientists thought nothing of it as a face only a possible Martian mesa. Some thought of this creation on Mars as a face others thought of it just as a landmark on the planet.

The face got a alot of publicity from the people that thought it was real and also the people who didnt. In my opinion I would like to think of it as a artifact of the other possible beings but I cant bring myself to think that it's real. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Now I can believe that, even though I often dream of far off places and creatures like the vampires in Lost Boys or the Goblin King I can't bring myself to believe that that is a artifact.

Science most of the time has a solution to what things are while some think it's a thing of signifigance like another race of space people it's not, it's just a rock formation that happened and will happen again. The world endlessly enjoys tricking us with things like this, aliens, vampires, werewolves, sea monsters, and zombies. They are all in the same boat even they don't always seem like they are.

ec0315b,"In 1976 a NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars looking and taking pictures of places where Viking 2 could land. It spotted a shadow that looked like a human face. It was a huge head about 2 miles from one end to the other end. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Some scientists figured out it was just a mesa but people started thinking it could be proof that aliens were real. They then started making movies of the face and magazines and stuff like that because they believed aliens had created the face.

NASA already knew it was just a common mesa. NASA and the scientists already knew it was a mesa but it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. As soon as they showed the public the picture people started believing that it could be evidence that aliens created that and are living. Hollywood started making movies, books, and a lot of other stuff. Scientists wanted to be sure that it was just a mesa, so NASA then sent another spacecraft. They took another picture and saw that it looked nothing like the first picture. They had to send another spacecraft in 2001 just to make sure it wasn't a mistake and to see which one was correct. The picture looked different too but looked so much better so NASA and scientists told the public it was a mesa.

The face in Mars was just a natural landform. The same thing basically happens around Western America. A guy, Garvin, said that the face reminds him of Middle Butte in Idaho. He said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height at the face on Mars."" The first picture they took in 1976 of the face really looks like not a natural landform. As the cameras got more better, in 1998, the face kind of still had the face shape but it looked more flat. The picture in 2001 just made the face look just like a natural landform. The 2001 picture, which is the latest one, shows no proof of living things in mars. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh in the first picture they took. The latest picture, in 2001, the face looked like a butte or mesa. The face was just a natural landform like the landforms that happen in Western America. If it was proof that there is living things in Mars, it would be beneficial for both tax payers and NASA. Hopefully they'll go again soon and take pictures to confirm if it was a natural landform or it's really proof that there is living things in mars, but I don't think they're going to go again because a lot of people now believe it was just a natural landform.

At last, the face was just a natural landform and was not made by aliens. The face did really look like it was created because that's what the people in ancient times bascically did but it was just a landform.

Things like the Rocky Mountains, or as it says in the passage, the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Many people were disappointed when they found out the truth. That this mysterious face was just a natural landform created over time. Even after NASA confirmed that this was just one ordinary landform, people still weren't convinced. So, on April 5,1998, an MOC team went out to Mars, and took pictures that were ten times sharper than all the originals. Thes pictures proved that this was just an ordinary landform that was formed over time. This ""face"" is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa her on earth found in the American West. Chief scientist for the NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says that the face found on the surface of Mars is actually about the same size as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

to them that that martian mesas are common around cydonia,I would probably research important facts to support my claim. I would explain that the ""face"" is really pilled up rocks that give off the illusion of a person features, eyes,mouth, nose, things like that. In the passage it says ""What the picture actully shows is the martian eqivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the american west.A lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the face, through all the years of research and the uncovering of rocks people started to realize that the face really wasnt there. Scientist took pictures during the years 1976, 1998, and 2001 to give show us what we thught was a face was really a natural landform. On april 5,1998, when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, michael malin and his mars obiter camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origianl photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitig when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform not a face or a alien monument after all.

ec49c39,"The face you see in the photos is merely an illusion to you. The face is a huge rock formation which resembles a head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, mouth, nose, etc. There has been three photos taken of this rock formation since 1976, since the 1976 photo the camera resolution, meaning the focus of the camera, has improved. Since the resolution of these cameras have improved you can see clearly that there is not actually a face on the surface of Mars. It is just merely a large buldge of rocks.

The face you may have once saw is only a shadow of a rock formation. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet to look for its sister ships possible landing sight when they found the rock formation, then they snapped pictures of the rocks. Remember the camera resolution was not as clear in this time period.

Due to the scientific studies and the fact of the camera resolutions we have found that there is not an alien life force on the surface of Mars. The only thing we've found are rock formations. The most recent picture taken was at least tens times sharper than the ones before, revealing it is just a natural land form.  ",2,1,0.8829073905944824
ec4bb27,"Aliens! Ha not true. In the article Unmasking the Face on Mars. we have put out an image of the face on Mars. This Face was not made by aliens becuase its like a normarl landform found on Earth, authors made it so the public would be attracted to Mars, and it was proven to be a landform just like any other. This is not made by aliens it look alot like common land forms found on Earth.

From the ship point of view its just as if it were a landform found on Earth. First, in the text it states ""the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" Showing that is just somthing found normally on a landmass. Second, the unusual shadows in the photos make it look Egyptain. Like something that would naturally form in that kind of climate. Lastly, on the JPL web site it revealed as a natural landform and not an alien monument.

Authors who put out the photos of the Face on Mars made it so the public would be attracted to it. First of all when people try making something interesting they could lie. In the article it states ""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It certainly did!"" Then, somthing they said made it a huge hook. This was put into a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines. Lastly, All of this got people thinking that NASA would rather hide anything they really have about life on Mars. In what case we have nothing to hide because the face is just a normal land mass.

The face was proven to be a landform. First off, befor it was put out to the public it was said to have looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Nothing had to do with any other life form on Mars. After, It was all put out to the public and made into a huge deal people started to think we were hiding somthing at NASA. When really we stated it could be a landform befor all of it was in a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines.

We can only go off of what we believe. You may believe in aliens, but someone might think that you're losing it. How could aliens even make a face in the ground? It could just be that many thing hit the ground of Mars, and it turned out to look like a face.

I believe that aliens don't exist, because there is no evidence that aliens live on Mars. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform. If you belive in aliens then you're going to think that they made the face. No one can tell you what you belive.",2,1,0.829674482345581

Not only that but when we took the pictures we used our cameras absolute maximum resolution so it would be as clear as possible. Plus the evidence has changed. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. So we know that the planet is changing and thats how we know that the landform isn't created by Aliens. Plus we have a Surveyor which is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. The number one way we know it is a land form and not something created by Aliens is because As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!.

The day the picture was taken was a very shodowy day, as it is said in the article the photo was taken in April a usual cloudy day in Mars. The camaras back then focused less than what our camaras do now. On April 8, 2001 when the picture was taken again it was summer and a cloudness day in Mars. When they saw the picture it was just a mesa. You have to understand that the time has pased and camaras have changed so in 2001 the camaras were better. So later on we can understand why because of the clouds that especific moment the mesa could of looked like a face.

Now that you have learned that it was all just that the camaras back then were a little blury, now you have to now that the Face on Mars was just a natural land form. First the article states that mesas or a butte are also just a common land form. This kind of landforms are also found in the earth around the American West. The whole Face on Mars was just caused by a natural process in Mars, by the weather. So now you have learned that all of this was a natural process of a masa that day they took a picture and it happend to look like a mans face.

After all of this research that scientist have found, we have all learned the real image of the Face on Mars.

There were shadows that made it look like an egyption pharaoh. They thought it was just the ground on mars. It kind of looked like a human head. Everyone thought the face meant their was life on mars. Nasa tried to cover it up.

When we first photographed the Face is 1976 we said it looked like a face, but when we released the pictures a few days later the caption noted a ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This means that other people here at NASA had doubts about it being an actual human head.

When we went to photograph it a second time in 1998 we got a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. After waiting for the image to appear on the internet we stated that it was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all.

Then we went back to photograph the Face a third time to prove that it was just a natural landform on April 8, 2001. It was a cloudless summer day which means that the images would be clear. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's best quality. Jim Garvin later added to the subject of the Face being a natural landform by saying ""It remimds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake Piver Plain in Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes form of an isloated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This means that Jim Garvin believes that it may just be a lava dome that is on Mars and not a face.

There is just to much evidence as to why this lanform isn't a face. I'm sure many of people would agree with me on this topic. Maybe one day we will discover life on Mars, but for now it is just a natural landform.                          ",4,1,0.9010031223297119
ecb977a,"Twenty five years ago NASA’s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking photos of possible landing sites for its companion vessel Viking 2. While looking over a region of Mars called Cydonia, controllers of Viking one at the Jet Propulsion Lab were stunned to see what looked like a giant head almost two miles long from top to bottom. They quickly came to a conclusion that it was just another

Martian mesa, commom in Cydonia. Although there were some skeptics.

The “Face on Mars” became an icon. It was talked about on radio shows, it was written about in books and magazines even placed in grocery store checkout lines. Some belived that the face was proof of ancient civilizations. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact. Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist for NASA said “We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.”

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team photographed the face ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, The photograph uncovering a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. But some were not satisfied.

The Face on Mars can be found at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April ’98—a cloudy time of year on Mars. The camera on board MGS had to look through clouds to see the Face. Maybe, said some skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. Mission controllers decided to look again. “It’s not easy to target Cydonia,” said Garvin

“In fact, it’s hard work.” Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips.

ecbdf77,"Imagine, scrolling through google just like you do everyday, and finding something you could only remember as a nightmare from your childhood. Well that may have been the case for some. In 1976, photos from NASA were leaked around the world, revealing a strange face on the face of Mars. But is that reaally what it was?

When scientists saw this formation, they to were astounished. Most just believed it was a martian messa, but few didn't. They believed there was truly acient life on Mars. Messa's were very common in Cydonia, the place they found the landform. So that was what it was expected to be, but there were still skeptics.

People from around the world believed NASA wanted to hide something. That they didn't want anyone knowing there really was life on Mars. But why would NASA want to hide something so extrordinary? Not to mention the fact they would get even more publicity and money spewing their way. But the people weren't satisfied, so NASA decided that in 1997, they would go back and capture more.

This would prove to be very difficult for NASA. The rotation of Mars would make it hard to actually land near Cydonia, but in 1998, they did it. The photograph was ten times sharper than the last from 1976. It showed that the formation, was just a formation. Not any ancient artifact. NASA took all that time to prove something that was already proven. Yet few people still were not satisfied.

The people argued that, because it was winter on Mars, it was to cloudy for the camera to take a proper photograph. They thought maybe alien markings were covered by haze. So NASA decided to set off one last time. On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second picture, this time with even better cameras. It once again, showed for sure that the landform was nothing but a messa.

One scientist, Jim Garvin, Even compared it to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, trying to help the people understand. NASA whent through so much trouble to prove to the people that it was not life on Mars. So they eventually came to the conclusion that it was just a landform. But there will still always be skeptics.

ecfadac,"The concept of aliens is a topic that some of us believe and some of us do not. Whether it has to do with how aliens may have affected how Earth was created or that there are other living organisms on planets other than Earth. Most scientists have used reasonable research to discover that aliens are not real, but yet there are still some scientists that believe they are in fact real. Based on the photos taken of the Face, aliens did not create this structure, it is simply just a natural landform.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft visited Mars and discovered the Face while snatching photos for landing areas for the Viking 2 ship. It looked as though it was the shape of a head, which is why it is known as the Face. This formation was gigantic, measuring almost two miles across. Something so giant couldn't have been formed from aliens, especially if it resembles a head, symbolizing that it may be an imprint of an actual alien. As they studied the photos of the Face, they began to realize how similar its features were to those of a human's face, or this case, what could be an alien. These facial features were then recognized to be just shadows, which adds to the fact that the imprint of a human, or alien face, could not have been formed. A formation this large cannot resemble that of a human, nethertheless an alien.

For twenty-five years, ""The Face of Mars"" was a famous attraction, attracting many people to be interested and cause an even broader range of thoughts about how this landform was created. As more people become engaged in this unusual formation, NASA continued to snap photos of the Face to uncover more information about what it really was and how it was really created. Later on, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took one more picture that had ten times the resolution that the orginal Viking images had. When this picture was viewed by many on a web site, it then revealed that it was, indeed, a natural landform and there was no evidence of aliens, as many people thought. Information from the several images that were taken establish that this structure is a natural landform, and not a creation from aliens.

Even though images proved that the Face was a natural landform and not something created by aliens, there still remained people who didn't believe this concept. At the time the most recent photo was taken, it was winter on the planet, and the Face on Mars was located in an area that consisted of a cloudy region. Those who still believed that aliens created the Face also believed that this area of clouds could have affected the picture that was taken during that time. The scientists claimed that it isn't an easy task to find the Face and capture a decent picture of it when possible, but still yearned to capture another shot to prove that aliens had not created it. So, on a summer day that consisted of no clouds, the team captured another photo with the maximum resolution. Because of the outstanding resoluation of the photo, it then again proved that it was simply anatural landform and that aliens did not play a part in it's creation.

Throughout the journey of discovering whether this creation was formed by aliens or that it was a natural landform the scientists and photos taken proved that there were no aliens. Although somemay still believe that there were aliens, these photos demonstrate real evidence that there was not. Like the scientists said, it was very similar to a landform on Earth, that is created naturally. Because of this discovery of the Face, scientists have been given the chance to explore the realmsof creations on other planets and prove that they cannot be formed by aliens, but simply by the natural occurences that take place on that planet.

They have used better pictures and comparison from Earth.

Using pictures to discorver the ""Face on Mars"" was difficult in 1976 because we did not have high tech cameras to prove anything, but as the years gone by we could soon tell the truth. For example, 22 years later Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) was able to take a picture of the figure ten times sharper. After this picture was taken, more people were able to believe that this mask on Mars was just natural landform. Then 3 years later in 2001 we had taken another picture that was even closer and it diffinetly showed landform.

Yes, the ""Face on Mars"" was discorvered to be a mesa, or landforms common around the American West. With all these pictures from 1976 to 2001, we had compared them to these Earth landforms.

There is not enough evidence to conclude that the stucture is an alien face. And besides, weird shapes always form. Its just nature.

Conspiracy theorists think its an alien and that we are hiding something from the people, but we have nothing to hide.

Around the face, you can clearly see there are other crater like forms on the planet. But those do not resemble any body forms? Thats because that is just how they were formed. The face is just another one of mother natures masterpieces. We shouldn't take it for granted and start asuming things that are not true.

In the story, it states that Garvin said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". This means that it isnt the first time nature made a weird but amazing shape in the earth. Have you ever seen a tree, thats bark makes a shape, and it looks like its staring right back at you? Well, if you have, you understand that it is just nature and its a happy surprise with no actual meaning. Its the same for the face on Mars.

If aliens are in the universe somewhere, and want to interact with us, I think they would find a better way to do it. They would most likly do something way more incredable and unforgetable. Not just stick one of their faces in the ground of the planet and see if anyone notices. If that was their plan, well, you have been notice. Now what? If they meant to put that in the planet, why didn't they respond when we figured out? Why didn't they land on our planet and say they magic words,""take me to your leader""?

In conclusion, I do not think that the face on Mars, is an actual face. Sure, there can possibly be aliens in the universe somewhere, there probably is!

The face on Mars is just a natural landform because natural landforms occur in earth too. One reason this is true is because on paragraph 12 Garvin states ""It reminds me most of middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Therefore it proves that landforms a natural occurence in planets.

Anothter reason the face on Mars is just a natural landform is because when NASA was taking photographs they didn't find alien life form.

On paragraphs 7 it stated, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There are no alien monument after all."" This is saying there are no alien who created the Face on Mars or no person can survive there to created this Face.

First of all, no one should tried to believe the alien are the one who creates the Face on Mars. Alien are myth not real. This Face is just a landform of Mars, on Mars, there is nothing but only rocks. If there were a creatures on Mars, how different would it be? On paragraphs 8 it cited, "" The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" This is telling us about the temperature and it is saying if the alien or an ancient people are there. Then the temperature has to be normal like earth.

Second of all, there will be a lot kinds of consequences if alien or an ancient people were living in Mars. On paragraphs 11 it cited, "" So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This paragraphs is figuring there are no alien or ancient Egyptian. But if there were, the scientists would have already discovered lots of materials to proved there are people and alien. No materials have been discovered on Mars yet.

Third reason to proved the Face on Mars is just landform is to let people know that it is pretty windy on Mars. Mars is windy but real hot too. Not just tectonic can changed the landshape like here on earth, but the the erosion could do that too. Mars does have erosion. On paragraphs 12 Garvin says, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" By visualizing at this paragraphs, it is giving us an ideas of creatives thinking progress. Because Garvin is comparing the Face on Mars and the lava dome, and saying it could be shaped from the wind.

Finally, to sum this up the Face on Mars is just landform no one can just appeared there on Mars, and creates faces. There could be more than one evidence how, why, and who creates the face on Mars.

Even one of my fellow peers Garvin said that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. Garvin also said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" In 1976 each pixel covered 43 meters, in 2001 each pixel covered 1.56 meters. That just goes to show you that there is no way that it could be created by aliens.

The pictures have shown that the Face is similar to a butte or mesa. Those landforms are common around the American West. Garvin said that it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. ""Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigh as the face on Mars,"" says Garvin.

The face that we are seeing is not created by aliens. It is a natural landform. The pictures have made the evidence very clear. The Face is just a butte or mesa. So don't believe what those skeptics tell you, they don't know the real truth.",3,1,0.8828374147415161
eda0755,"The thing is that 25 years ago a face appeared on Mars. Nasa said that it looked like someone looking up through tha camera at them whcih is very creepy. Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority says, says the article.

Don't get me wrong I do think that it is just a normal landfrom but, if you really look at it then it actually isnt a regular landfrom. To me it looks like the shadows on mars are creeping up on the mass of rock or sand or whatever it is. Like the scientists said the creeping up shadows is what gave the landform a the eyes the mouth and the nose.

But, this face they say is actually called a mesa. From all the years it has went through such as 1976 to 2001 I would say that the face is now older and deformed. The article says what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Gavin. They also says it's not easy to target Cynodia.

So when people say that the face is an actual face they are wrong becaus e if they would actually read a article on the mesa/face . They would see that they are not right at all they are just wrong. Beacus ethe shadows are what gave the massive the landform the eyes and the mouth and the nose. Remembe rthis they first discovered it in 1976 , and they kept on lokking at throughout the years. I think that it was an awesome thing to discover.",3,1,0.8666654825210571
eda2975,"I would tell them that the face is not created by aliens because if it was there would be a sign of some sort like there could be possibley more then one of the faces. Also there could have maybe been a symbol of some sort that could tell you or us that it may be out of this world. So studies tell us it isn't a alien monument because well when you look at the picture or image that was taken in 2001. It looks more like a rock or a mesa not something made.

Yes it may look a alien or something out in space made it but there is so much more proof you would need to prove it. Just think to your self how could you have proved that it was made by aliens? What proof do you have? On my side I know it in fact that it could not have been created by a alien because of the pictures tooken. It just doesn't seem like it was created by an alien it just looks like a cool rock that is really out there not created by something from out there.

Yes I do see why you or some people would get that it looks out of this world, but just if you look into it it's really just a landmark on Mars. Yes there may be conspiracys and theories about how this rock or face was made, but there may not be any facts to prove it completly.

So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says ""The ""Face"" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows."" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!           ",3,1,0.7840157151222229
eda6cd8,"The ""Face on Mars"" is believed by you and other people to be created by aliens, Extra-Trerstrial beings from another planet. Given that Mars is a planet that has liquid water and has climate and weather just like Earth, I do not support this contriversy. here are a couple reasons why I think this and why I think you should believe me too.

First, on May in 2001, NASA unveiled the image of the Face for all to see. The caption say it was a ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows making it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Given I already stated that Mars is somewhat like Earth, Earth too has rock formations made by nature. some examples are the Grand Canyon, the Appalachian Mountains, and Mount Fuji. These rock formations on Earth were maybe caused by a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, or some type of natural disaster. maybe on Mars, those could hapen. Mars has sand storms powerful than any blizzard. It may cause some sand to build up and possibly get near water and clump up and eventually harden into rocks. This could eventually build up bigger and bigger, making shapes and it's own holes. In other words, nature on Mars could have made this formation.

Next, It has become a pop icon. Starring in Hollywood fims, in books, magazines, radio talk shows, etc., You and other people might beleive anyhting you see in pop culture/ on TV. I don't blame you though, most things on TV or in some type of reading or a popular information source happen to be true, but a magority of it is mostly houxes and lies. People think that because it was on TV, it's true evidence of life on Mars, most conspiracy theorists say that NASA would rather hide the truth of life on Mars because they don't know IF there's life on Mars! Most theorists say that their used to be an ancient civilization on Mars, but who knows?

Finally, some scientists believe the FAce as an ancient alien artifact, photographing Cydonia, a reijon on Mars, became a priority, a vital/crucial thing to do for NASA when MGS arrived at Mars in September, 1997, eighteen years after the Viking missions concluded. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's MArs Exploration Program explains, ""We felt this was important to taxpayers, we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good look at it."" Later on April 5, 1998, MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. A team took a shot (ten times sharper than the original Viking photos). People were anxious to see what it finally was......a natural landform. Aliens didn't make the Face after all!

To conclude my claim, the ""Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform on Mars. It has many landforms like this just like Earth does. Even though it has been in pop culture and seen on TV, it doesn't mean it's real and truly built by aliens! And finally, most people believe it was an ancient alien artifact. but in reality, it wasn't. These are the reasons, claims, and evidence that the ""Face on Mars"" is truly a natural landform. ",4,1,0.8049051761627197
edae929,"Many people, including nasa, believe that "" the Face"" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.

First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.

Secondly, the only reason it ""has"" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.

Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.

Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.

Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.",3,1,0.8618736863136292
edc099d,"According to the article "" Unmasking the Face on Mars"", twenty five years ago something funny happend around Mars. On Mars there was a enormus head nearly two miles from end to end. They noticed this head figure when they sent cameras out on the Red Planet called Cydonia, they thought the head was staring at them in the pictures. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms. Also back then they did not have that great of cameras but now they do. With the new cameras, we could acually see that it was just a landform with cracks in it. The only reason people think it is a sign, is because of the shadows. It makes up its eyes, nose, and mouth. What, do you think they could make that with their bare hands?

I don't think that there is people on mars, if there was , we would have probably found them all ready. I beleive that the [face] is not really a face. If you you beleive that there is, than thats fine but the real truth is that its not a face.",2,1,0.8234900236129761
ee9a6d2,"Whether you are someone who believes conspiracy theories, or are just plain stupid and think that somehow the Face is evidence of alien life, you are still wrong. It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no ""Ifs, ands, or buts"", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it. However, considering that I must write this for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, I still have to argue about it pointlessly with an imaginary person who might or might not exist. So, I will cover two major points to prove to you that it's a landform, common sense, and the facts that we here at NASA have proven to be true.

First off, this argument is over whether Face was created by aliens, or whether it is just a natural landform. This is a pretty strange argumental topic, as people who believe this stuff anyway will hardly be convinced by a random scientist at NASA. Anyway, there is proof we have that face is just a natural landform, we have taken multiple pictues of it, and have concluded that, as shown with this cite of evidence, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the America West."" We can even say that it was not obscured by any clouds or haze because it was clear day on Mars the day the picture was taken. That should be the end of the discussion, but yet you say, ""But Mister science man, what if the pictures that you took couldn't see it because it was too small?"" Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". Factually that should be the end of it, it was a clear picture, that was enhanced for farther detail, on a clear day, with a high resolution camera.

Don't think I don't see you thinking, ""But will a only a photo actually be able to properly discern whether this is natural."" Well......no, it won't. Actually, you have me entirely beat on the fact that it simply could be a landform, made by aliens. Yes, there I admit it, sit at home and laugh at the fact that I could be wrong. Look, Mister Whoever reads this for a job, I argue for a living with my friend, and there is simply not enough evidence to actually say that there is no way that this is not alien made. There is actually a chance, somewhere, somehow, a superficially small chance that aliens might have had someplay in this. I know that all sounds crazy, but seriously, think about it. All we have is some lously picture that, while it shows us the exteriror, it doesn't show us anything about the interior of the landform.

Here is the other side to the point I just made, think about this rationally for a second, could aliens really have made a monument or some strange thing on Mars, only for it to be found by humans? Probably not, and all of this is so improbable that I really don't even need to write an argumentative essay about it anyway. There is an extremely small and slim chance that aliens had any part in making a mesa on Mars.

So all in all, there is factual proof we have, cited from the text I was given to say that aliens had no part in the making of Face, and that it is a natural landform. However, it isn't concrete proof, so for all we now it could be an alien itself. I have no idea, and neither will you. Again though, rationally, it has no relation to aliens. So that's all I got, the end.   ",4,1,0.7849997282028198
eebc4eb,"No, FACE is not created by aliens. as a person who works for nasa face is not created by aliens. i say this because Face is a naural landform found on mars. if you look at the pictures you can find that the imagae is getting clearer and clearer. Have you ever seen an alien in real life? do you belive that an alien has seen a human before? At first NASA

thought it was just a martian mesa that made it look like a eygptian pharoah. Afer a couple days had past we unveild the image wo the whole would could see the photo. When the image was seen by people the caption under image was "" It ewsembles a human head, with eyes, nose, and mouth.''

Have you even seen an image that it looks like a person? Well, that's what we found on Mars. After a few years had past on April 5, 1998, Michael Mailen and his Mars Orbiter Camera got a picture ten times better from before. When the picture was uploaded a website it was revealing a natural land form and no alien monument after all. Since the image was uploaded not everyone was satisfied. Skeptics, still beleve that alien was hiddenby haze. To prove skepicts wrong MGS went for a second look. When they went they captured an extraordinary picture of ''Face'' for the second time.

It seems real but it is actually shadows from a huge rock formation.

These shadows give you illusions of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

Since no clouds were around when the crew took pictures, sure enough the face was just a landform.

Usually this landform would cast a shadow resembling a face but no clouds were in the area for this to happen.

Thousands of web surfers wanted to know if the face was real or not and then the ""image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform."" The face on Mars was thought to be real but these pictures provided enough evidence that the face was a natural landform.

Not everyone agreed with the picture that was tooken. Because the photo was tooken in April'98, which was a cloudy time of year for Mars, people suggested alien markings were hidden by haze. Though this theory makes sense ,Mission controllers prepared to look again.

Because of this, I can understand why you might think that this is evidence of alien life. In hopes of debunking this suspicion, I am hoping you will read through my provided evidence that supports my claim that this ""face"" was not created by aliens.

First off, NASA would not be trying to hide the existence of aliens from the public. Their budget is primarily based on the tax and donation of those who are interested in space. If aliens were to exist, and NASA knew this, telling the public would give their budget a massive increase. So, to dismiss the accusation that NASA is hiding proof of evidence from you, I assure you that they would have told us just to get the much needed rise in their budget.

The picture of the ""face"" was taken forty years ago, just seven years after we first landed on the moon. As stated in the article, this was, in fact, the best resolution they could take the picture with. If you put two and two together, you can conclude that the highest resolution at the time was not very high at all compared to modern day photos.

This ""face"" has been confirmed to be butte or mesa, which are common here on Earth, as said in the article. If we were to colonize Mars in the future, and someone were to observe Earth and see such a land formation, do you think they'd call it proof of aliens? Of course not!

With the evidence I provided above, I hope you are able to make your own conclusion. As said before, the vast emptiness of space is impossible to predict, and the existence of aliens is likely. Everyone is entitled to believe what they want to believe when it comes to aliens, so I am only able to hope that you are convinced by my essay.",4,1,0.7293867468833923
efd6465,"People believe that the image that Viking 1 found in 1976 was a face like structure that was made by aliens. Others believe that was not made by aliens and is just the structure of the ground. I believe that it looks like a face, but I do not think aliens would make such thing. Even if there is aliens that are real.

I am one of the people who believes that this face like sturture was not made by aliens. As Garvin says ""As the rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel sixe."" This means that they can look three times the amount closer to the structure than most others. He also states that ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fact, It's hard work."" Although not many scientists believed the Face was an alien making, Photographing Cydonia was NASA's priority when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997.

The people who believe that this is a face and was made by aliens may be right, but people who think the opposite my be right. Because we do not know who and how this was made, makes it hard for scientists to figure out what and why the Face is there.

So, thought some people think that this is just the shape of the land like Garvin says. Others saying that aliens made the Face and that there is really aliens. We still do not know what and how this was, therfore why this was made. ",2,1,0.8284841179847717
efe002a,"This article for me is kind of hard to believe. These people have never been up there to see this face on the red planet. Instead of sending a person up there to actually see it they send a machine to Mars to capture pictures of this face.

Scientist believe that this face is remains of alien structure but, do they have proof that aliens even exist? If they could get a picture of the face then why could they not get a picture of the aliens that were up there to die and have this face on face of Mars. This photo could just be a regular bump on the surface and the way the lighting is might make it look kind of like a face but, they have not yet to send anyone up there so they do not know for sure. If they really think that this is a face then they should send someone up there to capture a legit photo that is close up to prve that this face is really there. The face does not even look like a deformed creature it looks like a humans face and that is another thing that makes me not believe it. The scientist said that this face is a remain of an alien artifact but, if this is an alien than people might as well just start calling themselves aliens and aliens humans. If you look on the right side of the face you can not see anything but the shadow. This makes me wonder if it is just the lighting and makes me wonder if this bump looks like a face because of the lighting. Because if you think about it the scientist may have done that on purpose so people wouldn't say that they could not completely varify this thing but, really it looks like a bump. Also, if you look towards the bottom of the bump there is a ring around it and I do not think that scientist know exactly what aliens look like because they have never captured a photo of one, so how do they know that this is even an artifact of an alien.

These scientist probably have some notes taken on why they think this is an alien but, from the stuff that I thought about this looks more like a human than anything and they have no proof that they know what aliens look like. If they are so sure that this is a face of an alien they why did they not put a picture of an alien in the article.",2,1,0.8040941953659058

The head you could found was from two miles from end to end. The face on Mars is found in 41 degress north martian latitude and also it was winter.

A few days later there was a change that mars is becoming a pop icon. Scientist found out that it was a Martian mesa and that those shadows made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. The Martian mesa just not had a head it also had a mouth,eyes, and a nose like a real human will have. Since the spacecraft discover it. It came out in books,magazines, and radio talk shows.

For this disover from the spacecraft and the scientist it was hard work to discover Mars Global. The lava dome that is form like a isolated mesa it is the same height as the Face on Mars.

The picture of the Face on Mars was captured on May 21, 2001, and a few days later it was shown to the public which got this whole thing started. Most of the people from NASA believed that it was just a natural landform, but conspiracy theorists believed the it was created by aliens on Mars. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper to reveal a natural landform. It was just a huge rock formation which resembled a human face, and the defenders of the NASA budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars because they would benefit off of it.

A few days after the photo of the Face was snapped, they showed it to the public for everbody to see. The NASA team caption the photo with ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."" Some people believe that the Face was created by aliens on Mars. NASA and many scientists believed that it was just another Martian Messa. Martian Messas were common enough around Cydonia.

On April 5, 1998, The MOC team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. The photo first appeared on the JPL web site, and it revealed a natural land form. Since the Face was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, it was winter at the time they snapped the picture which was in April of 1998. At this time, it was cloudy on the planet Mars, so the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Conspiracy theorists said that maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.

Lastly, the defenders of the NASA budget wished there was ancient civilization on Mars. If aliens did exist and NASA did discover them or signs of them, then NASA would benefit off of it. NASA would most likely send people or some kind of camera to take better pictures and videos of Mars. NASA would not keep it to themselves, they would share it with the public. After all this time survaying and taking pictures of Mars, they have not found alien life form on Mars.

In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform like many others. The Face just happens to be unique because of it's many shadows that make the Face resemble an actual face. Many rock formations happen on the planet of Mars. The Face is no different then the many thers of it's kind.

f08a63c,"The planets are a fasinating part of science. They have charateristics that we can not even imagine and facts that we long to learn about. The mask that apeared on Mars was first spotted in the year of 1976. I can strongly say that the face on Mars is not created by aliens. I know this because scientists figured that is was a butte or mesa- landforms that are common around the American West. Also when they shot the pictures it was taken during winter when it is normanly cloudly, not a good time to take a photo.

The face on Mars is not a alien creation, but is a Marian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. This implies that the science behind this, is that the landform on Mars is non other than a mesa. Scientist also know that mesa landforms are common enough, especially around Cydonia. This shows that the unusual formation was definatly a butte, but this one just happened to make it look like a face.

In 1976 a Viking shot a photo of a face like portrait. This was taken during winter a cloudy time of the year. This demonstrates that this picture is not the most reliable photograph. And so On April 5, 1998 a team of MOC researchers went out a took a sharper photo,much more reliable thean the original Vikings photo. This reveils that the landform was very much a natural landform. Though this rock formation did very much resemble a human head, We know that this mesa was created by shadows not aliens.

The face on Mars show us that things may appear different from what they seem. Next time lets just leave it to the experts to tell us the science behind things.     ",3,1,0.901046097278595

In the science world you always have to have many sources to prove something is real.

There were always claims that the Face resembling landform was made by alien people but where is the proof?

I am about to tell you how there is no reasonable explanation for the mesa on Mars being created by aliens.

First, I will tell you a little bit about me.

I am a scienctist and I worked for NASA when Viking 1 journeyed through space. Over the years, as more advanced photography have taken pictures of the mesa, it has led me to believe that the formation is not an alien artifact.

Also, the mount on Mars looks just like the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"".

Which makes me think it was just a coincidence that it looks like a face.

Next, the image from Mars Global surveyor in 1998 does not resemble a face to me at all.

The Viking 1 photo probably had bad shadows.

The face was ""formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"".

Further, the landform resmebles mountains and hills on earth; and other planets have mountains and hills too.

Moving forward, people think NASA is hiding something, but in reality finding other forms of life would benefit many studies and researchers.

""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

Finally, how come there is no other evidence of life on Mars?

Don't you think that aliens would have made other landforms?

In conclusion, life on other planets is very hard to prove.

We have many explanations for why the Face is a ""huge rock formation...which resmebles a human head."".

f11d525,"Aliens did not make this face for seval reson. It was made naturaly. There are alot of evidence to back up my stament. Other NASA scientist can back me up on this. Here are some resons.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team smapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on JPL web site revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added.""So, if there were object in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramid or even small shack, you could see what they were!""

""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in hte Snake River Plan of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

If that does not convince you then nothing will. It is just a natural landform. Garvin said it and other people did too. So I backed my infomation up. ",2,1,0.8521327972412109
f12d457,"The natural landform on mars which is called Face, is most definetely natural and with facts it can easily be proven. Such as the original picture that saw the face was all the way back in 1976. Also the camera was so old the pixels it produced we 43 meters per pixel according to paragraph 10 of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars. One more thing that proves that it was just a landform is that if it was an alien artifact, NASA would most definetly have got a good picture on the cloudless day in 2001.

First off, the technology back in 1976 may have been good for the time, but that technology didn't even compare to the picture in 2001. When you look at the difference in the pictures, you can easily tell the 1976 camera was simply not a good camera and simply couldn't take very good pictures. This was most likely why it looked like a face in the first place because the camera did not get a good picture; which in turn made it not look like what it actually was; a natural landform.

Some people might argue the fact that the picture was clear enough to tell it was a face, but that is simply not true. Think about trying to take a picture of something big, but your camera only gets 43 meters per single pixel. It would look like a bunch of colors blurring together. That is what happened with the 1976 picture from the Mars Global Surveyor. The colors blurred together causing the picture to look like a face. Also the human mind has an instinct to distinguish faces from pictures and in our daily life. That instinct is another big reason why people think it looks like a face, even though it is just a natural landform comparable to a mesa.

Lastly, and the best reason, is if there really was aliens, NASA would definetly have got a good photo in 2001. In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" in paragraph 11 it states "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This proves that nothing was close to it and there was no sign of transport or living quarters. More than likely if something had built a statue there, there would be some type of housing or transport nearby.

In conclusion, there is no 100 percent proof for either side,but evidence leans strongly towards that it is a natural landform. This is why you should also belive that it is not really a face, but you should believe it is a natural landform. There is much more evidence and basic scientific proof that is a landform, and was not created by aliens.",4,1,0.8354969024658203
f137caa,"The face on mars is nothing more than natural landform. Just like the grand canyon is a natural landform so is the area.I will prove that is only just a land form.

My first reason in it being a landform is the age of the picture. The first picture taken was back at 1976. One pixil in the picture was 43 meters long in the best picture taken by the Viking, but for the picture took at 2001 each pixil was 1.56 meters long. The picture took back 1976 is a blur compared to the picture took in 2001.

My second reason is conspricies. Conspricies are not backed up with confirmed information. Which makes not so belivble. Conspriciest look at the picture took at 1976 which is roughly a 30 year difference than the picture took at 2001, but the pixil difference was huge. Which proves that the picture took at 1976, the one that looks like a face, is not very accurate. Since there has not been confirmed ancient life mars it would make it even harder to belive Conspericist are near being anywhere being true.

To come to my conclusion, the information used to prove that the face was made by aliens is unaccurate. Not only that but it is also out of date and is overlapped by the new and more accurate picture.",2,1,0.8473979830741882

Later on people saw the new picture of 1998, and realized that it wasn't and alien thing after all. Jim Gavin stated that ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snke River of Idaho."" He also tha t""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

I also think aliens are a myth because we would already have facts and we have already told everyone. I bet someone just made up a story and told people they were real.

While NASA is taking pictures of places to land on Mars they spot something. They spotted a face on Mars they don't know how or what it's made of. A few days later NASA unveiled the image so everyone could see the face. It got so popular people started calling it the ""Face on Mars"" and it became a pop icon. It also starred in everyhting from Hollywood films, books, magazines, radiotalk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years (1-5).

Few scientists belived the face was alien artifact. Jim Garvin took a couple of pictures of it as soon as they could. Finally the team took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original ones. Not everyone was satisfied with the pictures they took. It was hard getting a good shot of the face because Mars had seasons and when they took the pictures it was winter there. With a lot of pwople not liking the picture they needed to try again but when. When will the Face appear again to get that perfect picture (6-9).

After they took the pictures they thought they were never going to get another chance to get better pictures. Then all of that changed on April 8, 2001 when there was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. All they had to do was roll the scapecraft 25 degrees to center the Face and take the picture.

He also states his rule ""As a rule of thumb, oyu can discern thiings in a digital image 3 times bigger han a pixel size."" If there was anything on the ground near the Face then they would be able to see it because of the pixels were a lot better (10-12).

People might argue that its an alien who put the face on Mars but we have no evidence that aliens are real. It has to be a landmass and some shadows because we would already have known about aliens if they existed. It might look like an alien created this with the Viking photo in 1976 but in this picture it shouldn't. We have gotten a lot more advanced from then and we can also zoom in more so we can see the shadows and landforms outline a lot better.

The shadows of the head may seem like there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. It made people think it is a real face but it is just an illusion. The shadows may give a way to seem like there is a face. In my opioion, it could be holes on the head shaped form on Mars.

One of the three reasons is that according to the excerpt, scientists figured it was just another martian mesa,""common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian Pharaoh."" This shows that the figures were common around those areas but this one in particular had shadows which resembled an eyptian Pharaoh. Also, a few days after that NASA found out that the shadpows formed an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth but we really can't trust this if it's a coincidence or actually true.

Accoring to paragraph seven, on April,5 1988, when mars global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, a team snapped pictures ten times sharper than the ones the viking took. these pictures showed that the ""alien created"" landform was actually a natural one. The text supports this by showing that the they took way more sharper images which made them way more credible then the ones they took before because you could see the actual natural landform. Although he pictures were ten times sharper, there was still clouds which made the image hard to see making it not reliable.

""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin which really shows that the butte or mesa is really similar to the the Face on mars which can actually be one. also, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as th Face on Mars.

To sum it all up, the article had a couple sources of evidence to support the fact that the Face was really just a natural landform. Also, there are many sights of evidence to show why believing that aliens created the landform was eally wrong. After all we should ll believe in something that is credible and supported with many details an evidence. ",4,1,0.8955661058425903
f187667,"Why would anyone think it was made by aliens?Why would the aliens make a ""human"" face? Wouldn't it make more sense if it was a king figure they would have shaped a face into Mars instead of just a normal looking head? I mean although it does look like a face-I think it looks to much like a face. If ""Aliens"" did put that face there, why so? Because they want us humans to know that they exsist and we can capture the aliens and use them for government experiments? To give awat their location?Or because they have been watching us for many many years and they know that we humans are going into other planets to study them, so they created a face to show that they were watching us too? I would tell the person that a alien did not put that face there. There are many cases were there has been face lanforms-on earth-that look similar to this! Aliens wouldn't come to earth and put that there, correct? There have been heart shaped islands and many other things. So why would a face be any different just because it's on a whole other planet! So why would aliens put a face on Mars? If they knew we exsist or not. It could look like a natrual landform. Not everything on a different planet has to be made by aliens right? Although it also does look like an Egyptian, and there have been ""UFO sightings"" in Egypt, but what significants does the aliens have to Egyptains? And if so-why would they put in inside the ground instead of putting it up like a statue? I would beilieve it if was more statue like, than it being formed from the ground. And out of all of this-the face looks like it has been covered up in the years from 1976-2001. In 1976 it does look like a face, but it is not as detailed as the other ones. (Might partly be because the 'aliens' were still in the building process) But as we go on in the years-it seems as if it wasnt a face anymore. Therefore-it could a have been a very slim chance it was aliens. It was just the landform changing over the years-because it's what landforms do. Honestly, I don't think NASA would approve of showing any case of real aliens exsistance. That would send chaos down here on earth. NASA would have probably kept that

secret until

many years later, possibly not at all. It's most likely that are no proof of aliens yet anyway. So why would aliens create the vast head? What purpose does it serve? Then again it could all be a landform and everyone is overthinking this and being very overly-dramatic about aliens exsisting. But who knows what lurks out in the universe? There is possibly more plantets we have yet to find. Maybe even one that an sustains life the way earth does. But that would defineitly not be the case. These people are being paranoid. I would tell this person to explain how and why a alien would put a human face on Mars.",3,1,0.853539228439331

For those who thinks it was created by aliens, I can't say that it was wrong, because it might be the right one too as well. I'm just saying that I'm in other side of their opinion. My opinion might not be right also it might not be what most of people said, but just like I said, I didn't believe that the Face was created by aliens.

We have all hear about this ""Face"" right ? , Well if you haven't Is really just a landform. The other Scientists has all of these people rallied up because they think that aliens are to exist. That cannot be possible because , if aliens existed then why are we just finding them? Wouldn't we already have proof of their existence ?

Then Again , there are all types of landforms on earth some man made and more of the natural kind , So basically what you guys are saying is that if we find landform that looks like something is automatically aliens ??? what about mount rushmore ? That is a man made structure not saying that the ""face"" is man made but its just not relevant to get all of this contrversy about something that we barely know about .

So Therefore, You guys really dont know what the structure is. none of us know what ""it"" really is , It might look like a face but aliens are just not relevant enough to believe that they actually did something of this nature. i personally do Not believe in aliens , well would you blame me ? We have been to the moon, we have had a rover on mars for years ! and what do we get? nothing , just a rocky surface . no aliens , no water , No life period.

Nevertheless, even though in paragraph 10 it says, ""that that put out The maximum camera resoulution and each pixel spans 1.56 meters thats still not giving us any proof . We have been on this ""Aliens Are Real"" Stuff for a while now , and we dont have nothing that proves it. Don't you guys think that we should just cut it all out the picture ? we are wasting money on absoutely NOTHING.

Finally , as I finish my statement I will just say that im'm not telling you guys to give up on your research , Not at all . but all I am saying is That If your gonna try and find these ""aliens"" of yours Atleast have some proof of their existance. Then Maybe I'll Believe You all when You do it. Thats all i have to say , I plead my case now . Goodluck with your research .    ",3,1,0.7739533185958862
f1eec22,"The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. It is simply a natural landform. It was just giving the illusion of a real human face. Here are some reasons why.

They thought it would be a good way to engage the public by giving the liiusion of eyes,nose,and mouth. They wanted people to be interested and it worked. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and realized it was no alien monument after all. The picture was ten times clearier than the other ones. Skeptics assumed alien markings were hidden by haze. But that's not true. Just like any other landforms it would be hard to see. It's hard work to target cydonia. Whenever they get a chance tot they try to capture it. In 2001 they captured a even better picture. It was like Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack. But it was really a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. It looks like the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Most peopel didn't believe or want to beieve it. They thought the aliens created it because you could not really see the face. The 1.56 meters,compared to 43 meters per pixel is the best 1976 Viking photo. So whatever they were seeing was an illusion. There's no alien monument on the face so it has to be a landform.

So the Face on Mars was not created by aliens because there's evidence that is a landform. All the pictures saw landform,no alien monument,and everything else was just an illusion. That's why

the Face on Mars was not created by aliens.                                                                                                                                             ",3,1,0.8810527324676514
f29d052,"In the article, I think that the image of the ""face"" on Mars is just a landform. The NASA workers think that that the face was created by aliens. I don't think it is so.

When it says in the article ""The camera on the board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" From the image they took, I don't see anything that has to do with aliens, and if they think the holes and landforms are made from aliens, well they are not because one aliens don't exist, and two holes can be their because of meteroids. Also how I think the face is a natural landform, the mount next to it doesn't look like a face. It just looks like a regular, normal landform, or it could of been from a meteroid that fell. If they think that aliens made those mount, they need to prove it with images of the rover going around Mars, because what they are saying about the holes and the ""face"" hasn't fased me one bit.

On the top image of the article, it shows the images throughout the years of 1976 (left), 1998 (middle), and 2001 (right). The first image of 1976 which was taken by Viking 1 does look like a face at first, but you never know, they probably used a camera that wasn't really good, and the image was blurry. I think that is why the landform looks like a face. The second image of 1998 which was taken by Viking 2 is a little more clear, but also still looks like a face, but it is starting to fade away, the nose, mouth, and eyes. The third image of 2001 which was taken by NASA does not look like a face at all. The landform has all kinds of cracks, and lines on the mount.

With the images, in the article is says ""Twenty Five years ago something funny happened around Mars."" So that was twenty five years ago when they took that photo, so that proves that in that time, they didn't have all kinds of cool techology to take photos that are really clear. Unlike in 2001, they had really good technology to take clear images to take a photo of the mount or whatever you think it is.

When they say that the aliens made the Face, you might not want to go with it because they might research it, but they also might assume what it is right away. And how they thought it was a face in 1976, they might of not had good technology in the 1900s. And they still believed it when they took the 2001 picture, and they even have good technology now. I don't know if they still believe it now, but if they do, that is suprising me.

When people put anything online about how they think it something, don't believe it until you see it yourselve. Either on the computer, or a book. But you don't have to go with what everyone is saying just because they think it is that, go look it up yourself, and if you don't think the image is compared to what they think the image is. That doesn't matter if you think different, it is who you are and what your imagination tells you what the object, image, color, etc. That is what makes you special in your own way.",3,1,0.8724613189697266
f29d95b,"Twenty five years ago, NASA's VIking spacecraft snapped a photo of what looks like a human face on a region of the Red Planet, Cydonia. Many people believed the Face was created by aliens, but NASA found evidence that it was equilavent of a butte or mesa. The Face on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact, but a landform.

The photo captured by the Viking 1 was very poor quality. In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor captured a photo using the camera's maximum resolution. Each pixel spans 1.56 meters, while a pixel on the original photo spans 43 meters. What the 2001 picture actually showed was equivalent of a mesa or butte. These are common landforms on Earth around the American West.

That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

People seem to believe everything on the internet or media. The Face on Mars has appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even starred in a Hollywood film. The media has brainwashed people to thinking the Face on Mars is an alien artifact, with no scientific evidence or proof. People have been believing the media's theories on the Face over NASA's scientific research that the Face is actually a landform.

NASA has found evidence over the years that the Face on Mars was not made by aliens, but people still refuse to believe it. The original photo was taken in low quality, as technology was not as advanced back in 1976. Now that NASA has taken higher resolution photos of the Face, we can conclude that the Face on Mars is a mesa.

The clearer and closer the camera got the less it looked like a face at all. from far away it looks clearly like a face so many people thought thats what it was but shortyly after that they when back up to mars and got a clearer picture of what it really is, it is much more clear than it was before and you can tell it doesn't look quit like a face but like a natural landform.

f2b1720,"The face look alike that was on Mars was not created by aliens. Many people may believe that but they might just want to belive that there are such things as aliens. The face was created by just landforms. Reasonings being is, MOC, or Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture, the NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get such an accurate photo, and people over the interent were making their own stories up to make it seem like there was an alien that made that.

MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the face like rock. When they took a picture that was alot more accurate and sharper looking than what Viking's had taken, they were able to zoom in and look at more then just the face. The passage says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing . . . a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all."" Which, since they ARE scientist, they have done their research on the picture and done as much looking into as they possibly could have.

NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get an accurate photo. In the article it says, ""... Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" So, when the Viking's took the picture and the shadow was in it, it made it look something more than what the MOC had caught. The Viking's had no profesional camera to take that picture of the landform. Also, they were far away from the planet, they were circling it, so the shadow that they were seeing had to of been from something else. Or maybe from what they were even in.

People over the internet were making their own stories up. In the article it states, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" Since people believe whatever they see on the interent, they had to of jumped to conclusions and people had to of been throwing out the idea of ""Oh! that has got to be made by an alien!"" so that's what people starting saying. The NASA reveiled th photo hoping it would bring attention to Mars, but that is sure what they got. But it was the atention that an alien had made the landform.

From what scientists have researched, they found many evidence to support their conclusion.

Some people do think it is the work of aliens, but many people have more resonable explanations.

That they can support from evidence they have either seen, watched, or heard about, that make it a valid explanation.

First off, scientists thought it could possible be just another Martian mesa, because they were common around Cydonia.

Most of all they wouldn't send pictures and information out to the public without being possitive about their discoveries.

We weere sitting in my living room on the tan couch with the television on. My friend was tall with blonde hair and skinny. I had brown hair and was average height. I worked for Nasa so I had seen pictures of what it was and had proof that it was only a mesa and it was an illusion to the human eye.

Zeke thought it was an artifact on once living life on Mars. He thought Nasa was going to say it was something else so people wouldn't truly know what it was. He thought Nasa was trying to keep it in the dark so noone would try and travel there to get closer looks on it and steal there idea. Zeke thought we needed to run further studies to truely figure out what this was.

I told Zeke that it was only a landform on Mars and not some alien artifact. I told him that it was a mesa which was common in this area of Mars. I also explained how shadows made it look like a face and how it was all an illusion that was visible to the human eye. They said that this landform was nothing more than a landorm on Mars that wasnt what it had appered to be.

Zeke, who was a man of what he said, did not believe me and wouldn't take my word for it. Once he got an idea in his head it wasn't going to move for anything. It did not matter what proof you showed him he wouldn't believe as single word. He argued with me about if or hours until finally we decided that we wouldn't argue about it anymore. He still told me he thought his idea was right and I was completly wrong.

I told Zeke i worked for Nasa so I would know way more than he does an I insured him it was not an alien artifact and it was just a mesa which looked to be something it wasn't and that he shouldn't be so stubborn about it and just believe me. Knowing Zeke I didn't thnk he would even budge. Of course i was right and Zeke didn't sway his answer at all.

Conspiracy theorists belive that NASA is just trying to hide aliens on mars. Many people wanted to see the picture of the face formation, but later reaveling that it was just a natural landform. Scientists said that it wasn't easy for them to get another look at the face beacuse the MGS only scans in 2.5 km strips and they don't past over it often. Later NASA took another picture and the MGS took a photo using the cameras best resolution.      ",2,1,0.8610531091690063
f3c4832,"Is there a face is on Mars? I would say no, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact. There are shadows that can make it seem like a face ,but shadows can alter thing appearnces. April 5th, 1998, and April 8th 2001 have clearer images that can prove that prove that it is also not alien. Unlike the photos of the Viking 1 in 1976 ,which were older and were less clear. So the Face is not real because of, the later more clearer images prove that it is not, and shadows can alter one's apperance.

First off, the Face on the isn't a face it is a rock on Mars, that had shaows that made it look like face. People and imgaes can come about blurry ,and may looklike something else. Also pixels also can help make things seem like they are not what the they are. Like the picture in April 8th, 2001 pixels made it look clearer. A compasrion can be shared of the 1976 picture to the 2001 picture, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""(10). There is comparaion toeach photo that was taken and as time went on it got clearer and showed less of a face. Which makes it more of reason it is not an ailean artifact.

Next, on April 5th ,1998 after the 1976 Viking picture of the face on Mars became a hit. NASA wanted to go take another picture ,because people keppsying it was made by aliens,it was difficult though. After NASA had gotten the photo though,it was more clear, which again proves that it is not an alien artifact. Even in the passage it states about it ,""Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tne times sharper than the origianl Viking photos""(7). After that it was on the web people realized that it is a land form not a alien structure. So it is a fact that it is not an alien artifact.

Finally, On april 8th ,2001, people still were blieving that alien made the landform. So NASA snapped another picture, in the passage it states ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view""(10). This mean they had gotten a good angle on the Face. And the picture was more clearer again. They had proven to the world that the Face was not alien. It was a landform.

My oppionent might state to me though that we did not see the real deal on screen just with a picture. They could of had edited it to make not alien. That is true but in 2001 they didn't have good editing system unlike we do today. So that image can not be really edited.

In conclusion, the Face is not alien the images of April 8th, 2001 and April 5th, 1998 can prove this. Also there are not editing system theat were really good to photo shop back then, and it had been proven many times by NASA that it is not.   ",4,1,0.865025520324707

Then tell them how can aliens create a landform.

In conclusion, I would show them pictures of the landform on the monitor then zoom in and prove to them that its just a landform with an illusion.

f3ef9dd,"To start off by saying , Aliens really? If you believe in aliens show me proof. But saying they made a human face on mars. Can't be true and let me tell you why?

First, aliens don't exist, and if they did why would they put a human face on mars? Theses are all questions that want to be answered. But they can't if the thing that made it can't speak, and it was nature who made it. NASA just wanted show to show you there progress and how far they got. Hollywood and other people turn it into an attraction getter.

Second, it's just a landform Even NASA said it's called a mesa. In the picture its a landform that is te same thing it just has different forms. There's no face on mars.But NASA has discovered dryed

up water that shows there was life on mar but only plants.

In conclusion, some people may say ""well we found aliens on Earth and ufo's"" but when has NASA ever said we've found aliens...never. I know this because, if they found ufs's and aleins the government would pay mad money to get the edvidence. But they haven't found any so they can't get paid.",2,1,0.7772838473320007
f457fec,"Some people belive that the so called ""face"" on mars was created by life on mars. This is not the case. The face on Mars is a naturally occuring land form called a mesa. It was not created by aliens, and there is no consiracy to hide alien lifeforms on mars. There is no evidence that NASA has found that even suggests that this face was created by aliens.

A mesa is a naturally occuring rock formation, that is found on Mars and Earth. This ""face"" on mars only looks like a face because humans tend to see faces wherever we look, humans are obviously extremely social, which is why our brain is designed to recognize faces.

Many conspiracy theorists believe that NASA is hiding life on Mars from the rest of the world. These people would be very wrong. If NASA found life on Mars, then they would get millions of people's attention. NASA's budget would increase drasticly, which means that their workers would get paid more. There is no good reason that NASA would hide life on Mars from the rest of the world.

So, NASA is not hiding life on Mars from us, and they are not trying to trick us into thinking that the ""face"" on mars is just a mesa, because it actually is. NASA hiding life would be illogical, because if they found life on Mars, they would make a lot of money, and we all know that the people at NASA aren't illogical people.",3,1,0.8479377627372742
f491bd8,"The face on Mars can be explained many ways. Some ways may be that it was aliens. Some may say that it is just a unusual natural formation. There is no dought in my mind that it is a natural formation. There are many ways to explain that it is a natural formation.

First, here on earth we have many natural formations that stand out and have plenty of explanation behind it. One of them could be the dunes in the sahara. I am going to compare this to the face on Mars because wind can move sand, dirt, and dust. The wind could have shaped the pace on mars. Erotion could have played a big key in this too. The rock could have eroded from the dirt and sand rubbing against it. Even a metior from a long time ago could have shaped the face. Yes it is odd but if you see in the 19776 photo it is pretty well shaped so it had to be made by aleins around that time. Then look at the 2001 picture and it is eroded and not shaped like the other one. It is just a process planets go through and even earth goes through.

Secondly, the clouds and the camera could have made a little change in the look of it. It most likely is the camera from Viking 1. Nasa even said in paragraph 8 that they couldn't get a clean shot of it through the red clouds. Some may argue that with such an old camera how did Viking 1 get a really nice shot of it. Well that is a good point but it might have occured in that time era because it was in a nice condition to our pictures. Did you ever think though that it is just a rock that probably has alot of sand on it. Look at the 2001 picture, it is in an oval-square like shape. But look at the top of it. It looks like the wind has shaped dunes over the rock. And since the sand has moved it doesn't have the eyes and the perfect shape anymore. Viking 1 had a old type of camera on it. Today we have outstanding cameras and technology and we don't see the face anymore. Which one would you trust, the antique camera hundreds of millions of miles away, or next generation cameras?

Last but not least, it could be a rise in lava or underground material. Mars has the same inner layers as earth so don't you think it could be techtonic plate activity. An earthquake could cause an uprise in crust and rock. In paragraph 12 Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It could be a lava dome on Mars; however goes back to techtonic plate activity.

There alot of ifs, ands, or buts in this conversation. I am not saying that there was never life on Mars or there is no life in the universe but us, I am saying that it was most likely caused by natural causes. It could very well be that it was created by water or an ocean. The Mars face was created by natural causes.",4,1,0.8490869998931885
f49f29e,"The Face on Mars is a natural landform, though, some may think that it was created by aliens. NASA's research has shown otherwise. The Face was not made by aliens, but under natural circumstances. There were many high quality pictures of this landform taken and many scientist who studied them. Scientist have come to conclusion that the Face is just a natural landform that has taken a not so natural shape.

Many people still believe that the Face is some sort of acient alien monument. These conspiracy theorists think that NASA is just trying to hide the evidence of life on Mars. As said in the article ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars). Believers were still skeptical so, to be sure, NASA took more pictures of the Face that were clear to the eye. With these new high resolution pictures, as Garvin said, ""you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Basically, if there were life on Mars we would be able to see even the smallest of things through these photographs. There was nothing unusal found.

For 25 years conspiracy theorists have been questioning NASA's research. Specifically, on Mars and whether or not there is alien life on it. There have been movies and books that fanticize on the things that could possibly be living on the Red Planet. These theories are not backed up by knowledge and facts like NASA's. NASA's scientist are the best of the best when it comes to knowing abot outer space. These scientist have seen Mars, and the Face, in person. Most of the theorist have never left the planet. Lastly, there are many natural landforms like the Face on our own planet. An example of this is, Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho as pointed out by Jim Garvin.

Outer space is the home to many mysteries bu, the fact that the Face is a clue to alien civilation isn't one. Even though the landform looks as if it could a ruin of a acient alien civilization, the facts have shown that it is not. Through studying the pictures and positioning of the Face, NASA's professionals were able to conclude that it was just a natural landform much like the ones found here on Earth. This does not mean that there is no life on Mars, it just means that the Face is not a hint to finding it.",4,1,0.9293373227119446

""middle Butte"" in the Snake River plain on Idaho. Also scientists have figured that Earth and Mars are very much alike in size and the tempature.

Mission controlers also visited the face several more times since the first photo was taken in 1976.

Nasa had stated that how could it be an alien if there was no alien mounuments found after all.

After going and getting a picture they tried again when it was summer time so it would be easier to find. The photograph was took in a ditigal image so if anything like airplans or stuff of that short you could see what they are.

It has been proven with some very expensive and accurate technology that it is not an alien artifact. It would be in NASA's interest to share it if it is an artifact. The first 1976 Viking photo is not creditable.

The credibility of the Mars Global Surveyor has been tested twice on the Face. It took its first picture of the Face in 1998. Sceptics blamed the weather for covering up ""hidden alien signs."" Three years later, the Mars Global Surveyor took another picture of the Face. This picture was taken with optimul weather conditions and on the highest resolution possible for that camera. The clearity showed that the Face of Mars was mearly an amazing landform, not an alien artifact.

If for some absurd chance it was an artifact of some ancient alien race it would have helped NASA. They could have recieved more funds to go explore and find remenants of the alien civilization. They would have told everyone. They could make a huge profit from it. NASA could get more money from investors and taxpayers. It would have been to there benifit.

The Viking 1 photo is 40 years-old. The quality of it is not near;y the same as the Mars Global Surveyor. The Face of Mars may have only been seen because of weather conditions that day. In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture ten times sharper than the already 22 years-old. The Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture that was a lot clearer but still not good enough for some.

In conclusion, the conspiracy theorists have no reliable information. It has been proven by the MOC and the Mars Global Surveyor that it is just a landform. The 1976 picture is too old to be reliable. All it shows is a mesa with amazing shadows. NASA probably dreams it was an artifact so they could get a budget increase.

Many people are convinced that the ""face"" on Mars is from a living species. This is a myth. Yes, this does look like a face but there are many explanations for this. They named this form was located in Cydonia. I will explain to you what this ""face"" realy is.

When Viking 1 first took this picture in 1976 it really did look like a face. After that in 1998, when another picture was taken it started to fade a little bit and not look so much like a face. It started to look more like a formation with a couple of bumps in it. Then, when the lasy picture was taken in 2001 it looked just as a natural formation on a planet with a few cracks in it, nothing special.

NASA has made trips to fly over the formation. On April 5, 1998 thats when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. The Mars Orbiter took a photograph ten times sharper than the original pictures. When the picture was first let out on a JPL web site, all that was revealed was a natural landform. Skeptics had tried saying that alien marking were hidden by clouds in the picture.

Finally then on April 8, 2001 on a perfect cloudless day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for their second look. They took a picture that expanded 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meter per pixel in the 1976 original picture. These pictures really just show the equivalent of a butte or mesa. All these landforms are common by the American West. Scientists have all the information they need to prove that is is just a landform. There is no form of life living on Mars.

In conclusion this landform was sketchy. It did trick people into thinking that there was life on Mars when there wasn't. The original photo did have people thinking that there was life on Mars. The second photo had people thinkin 50/50 on wheather there was or wasn't life on Mars.

This worldwide phonomenon started with just a picture. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was up on mars roaming around and just with one snap of a picture it got it. This picture was a face that apparently according to the article looked like a ""Egyptian Pharoah."" NASA thought that the people would love to see this. Indeed they did. Immeditley the picture was on talk shows, radios, newpapers, etc. This picture just became the number one thing in the world. Just by one snap of a camera.

""NASA didn't confirm it was not aliens. They didn't even give out any information about it."" False again.

New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars fro what it really is: A mesa. According to this article's explaination, I believe that it is just a natural landform, not created by aliens. Some of the NASA's Mars scientists share their opinions based on what and how they discovered it.

To begin with, there are lots of reasons why the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team revealed that it was a landform and no alien monument after all by snapping a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos to be certain and clear. Also by looking at the picture, it looks like a huge rock that pops up and creates different shapes and forms.

In addition, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common arounf the American West. It also looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which JIm Garvin stated, "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte...."" and "" ..that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

f542473,"The image that has been being showed from NASA has studies thinking two different things. Some say it is a face that was created by ""aliens"", others are saying it is just a natural landform. There are three different images from different years that have showed formation and changes. The years listed on the images from NASA are 1976, 1998, and finally 2001. The name for the image is being called ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

The image that is being showed is just a natural landform. If it was something created from the aliens, it would have more evidence than what has been being showed. Aliens want to make themselves noticed not physically but mentally. I am correct because Mars Global Surveyor stated ""thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" With the technology NASA has, they will always prove others wrong who aren't supporting their claim of evidence. If I was a scientist, I would take my time studying the weird natural landform that was created before I let go any information to the people all around the world including studies like myself. Another reason why you should believe that the image is a natural landform is because Garvin stated ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" In space with all the planets that we have, anything can be formed onto them and turn out to be just a regular sighting for them and not something so mind thinking like this whole natural landform turned out to be.

This whole image is just a natural landform that has been formed. My opponet believes that it was a image created by ""aliens"" which was incorrect. With my proof and evidence my claim has been supported enough to be able to decide that it's just a natural landform. If it would have been created by aliens,

The side that disagrees with the thought that the Face was made naturally, are called speculators. NASA has realeased information about the Face, but speculators think NASA is hiding something from them which is called bona fide. Since the very first trip to Cydonia, many people have been intreaged by the topic. As said in paragrapgh 5 , ""The Face has become a pop icon"". The idea that a face was on Cydonia made people think that there had to be a creator. The creators were aliens. The next time the Mars Orbiter Camera went to Cydonia, NASA claimed there were clouds blocking the veiw of the Face. This must have shown that NASA was hiding something. NASA also tried to say that they don't pass over the Face that often. Maybe NASA didn't people to find things out. All these peices of evidence put together must prove that aliens created the Face on Cydonia.

Scientist from NASA can help prove the speculators wrong. Speculators assume that the Face couldn't have just been created over time. In paragrapgh 12, it states that there are similar landforms created, called mesa, in America. Next, the speculators say that there were clouds blocking the veiw of alien clues during the Orbit Camera journey. Since the clouds blocked the veiw of the planet, NASA sent another camera on clear day. In paragrapgh 10 and 11 it says the camera took the absolute maximum resolution. If there were any signs of anything strange the camera would have caught it. Speculators say that NASA wants to hide the fact that there were aliens. If there were aliens then that would help NASA's budget in future journeys. The evidence provided proves thay the Face was naturally created.

After recieving both sides of the story. I support the NASA and the fact that the Face was naturally created. The speculators had their concerns about the legibillity of NASA. Speculators believed that NASA was hiding things. NASA respnoded to the critics and proved that there were no aliens. Plus, if there were aliens out there then that would help

When the Face first got phototgraphed NASA ""unveiled the image for all to see."" in an attempt to get people to be more interested in mars. ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rahter hide, say conspiracy theorist."" Yet the article goes on th say ""Few scientis belebed that Face was an alien artifact..."" This means that many scientiss knew that the Face was a landform form the very beginning but only used it to get money for NASA to research more about Mars. Not only this but the weather was not an ideal time for the image to be taken.

When the image was taken it was at a certain time, year, and season. "" this on had unusual shadows..."" means that the sun was not hitting it deredctly to elliminate any shawdows that were there. ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north...where it was winter in April'98-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Plant."" This proves that the weather does have an effect on the image. Not only that but the image taken at this time was cloudy and reveladed a natural landform. The article goes on to say ""a cloudless summmer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look...Malin's tean captured an extrodinary photo using the carmera's absolute maximum resoluiton."" Meaning that the image was as clear as it could be and there were no clouds to make the image blurry. ""What the pictue actually shows is the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" This proves that landforms like these were also seen on Earth and alien did not make it. Plus landforms like it had been seen on Earth

Further more, this is not the first time a natural landform has been seen on Mars. In the passage it is stated ""Scienetist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one has unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh."" This means that in the location where the Face was discovered landforms were common and nothing more than natural.

An image of a face was photographed on Cydonia. NASA proved that the Face is only a natural landform on Mars and with enough eveidence to support it. The giant ""human"" face is just another natural landform and most definatly wasn't created by aliens on Mars.                   ",3,1,0.9065455198287964
f5a6bfe,"Now today I am going to disprove your statement that aliens created the Face seenon the red planet of Mars. The first thing that you have wrong is that the Face seen on Mars is of alien orgin. The Face that you see in the picture is just an oddly shaped Martian mesa. In fact there are very common on that region of Mars so for all we know there could very well be more oddly shaped mesas in that area.

The fact is that you miss read the caption of the picture or didn't even look at it at all. If you would've you should have seen the caption stating that the reason it resembles a human head is because of the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The only reason the let people see that photo is because they wanted more people to be intrested more in Mars.

Plus on April 5, 1998 NASA reaveled to everyone on their website the Face was mearly an oddly shapped Natural landform.

In conclusion there are several ways that we could disprove your statement. The first being that it is just a mesa which dosen't have a distinct form, which means that if another one forms it could very well be a dog or a cat. The second being that you may have just miss read or not have read the caption. Which clearly states that the reason the Face looks like that is because of the shadows and thats why it has a mouth, a nose, and eyes. Those are just two major reasons we know it's definetly a natural landform and not an alien made face.",3,1,0.8048832416534424

The Face was not created by aliens. In fact, NASA

has no proof that aliens even exist. After all, if they did exist we would have found more creations of theirs by now. Therefore, they do not exist, meaning that the Face is just a natural landform made by weather. NASA has never seen any type of alien life on Mars.

The Face could not have been created by aliens. The photographs show that the landform changed over time. Although aliens could have changed the creation, it would be very unlikely. The weather could have made the shape of the Face change. Some of the Face could have eroded away. Therefore meaning that aliens do not exist, and the Face is only a natural landform.

Others say the Face was created by aliens. However, if aliens existed, they would have made more of these exotic creations. If aliens did exist, why would they give themselves up for some landform after they had stayed hidden for so long? The puzzle pieces just don't fit together. It wouldn't make any sense. The creation is not alien made.

The Face is only a natural landform. It is not something that was created by aliens. In fact, NASA has no proof aliens even exist.

What where the things called that took the pictures on mars? How has finding this face changed our aspect on other planets or even other life. Was it really from a alien aircraft of just enviormental effects on Mars?

The very first photo ever taken was by a Viking 1 that was made in 1976. Then there was another one created named the Mars Global Surveyor known as the MGS which was made to prove it was not fake in 1998. They then made a very brand new MGS in 2001. The reason for this was because to show real 3D effect on the picture to get better effect on the picture.

How has finding this face on mars changed out aspect on things? It has changed it by us believing that there are more than just humans that roam our solar system. It started to make us believe that there were such things as aliens. Then people started to make conspiracy theories about NASA. They were saying NASA was lying and it was just a cover up to protect that aliens do exist in our solar syster.

Is this a real cause of a Alien aircraft or just a enviormental effect on mars that it had no control of at all? There are two posibilities in this quiestion yes and no

.The reason is because we don't know if it's true or not. In my opinion it is not true. It has even been proven by scientist that it is not made by aliens it is just a enviormental effect. There is no proof also that a alien did it.

That is what I have to say about the unmasking Face on Mars. Now you know what was used to take the pictures. You also know when it was used. Then I got to explain why finding this face changed the aspect of how people saw Mars diffrently. Then how if it was just a coincidence by enviormental effects or just a alien spacecraft.

In fact on Apirl 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time, after the Viking discovered the face over 22 years ago on 1976, Michael Milan and His Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a photo ten times sharper than the oringial Viking photos , witch revelaved a natural landform, as said by the Mars Global Surveyor team.

Some people were not convinced that the face was a natural landform , due to there being haze, winds and also a cloudy time to see the face through the camera, there were conspriacy theorists that said ""Perhaps skeptic and alien markings were hidden by the haze.""

But then on April 8 , 2001 almost 3 years later - a cloudless summer day, Mars Global Surveyor drew close to the ""Face on Mars"" they had to ""roll 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view"" said Gravin. Malins team captured a extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution, each pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo to finally prove that ""The Face on Mars"" is a natural landform, Still to this day there are conspiracy theorist who believe that ""The Face on Mars"" was not a natrual making!

Accoding to the text its a natural landfrom because the rule of thumb, the Martian is equvialent of a butte or mesa, and some skeptics say markings were hidden by a haze or it could have been because of the weather.

According to Garvin, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" also, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on thr ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.""! In the picture of The Face on Mars if there was anything that could be making this landfrom you would be able to see it.

In paragraph 12 it explains that the Martian is equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms wich are common around the American West. If aliens were to make The Face on Mars they wouldn't know the sizes of natural landforms. Also,even though The Face on Mars, is on Mars it deosnt mean that natural Earth things can't happen there either. Garvin also states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho,"".

Finally The Face on Mars is a natural landscape. Even though most people may argue over what it really is or who made it, there is enough information to prove that it is a natural landform.

The similar land form in Idaho has the same height as the Face on Mars. The pictures that they have captured shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

As I asked a few other scientist about it I knew it would be interesting to see and search on. As we all were looking at this photo of what seems to actually be a human face on Mars a new scientist walked in and talked about it.

He began to say that ailens put it there! All I could think of is why and how would they do it. They may not even be real, we have no evidence to show that soemthing living lives up on Mars. I had began to tell him that's it's not possiable! I even gave facts about how anything livinh like humans or animals couldn't live up there. But he still thought it was true.

As I read through so many of them they all had great point and soem didn't even know what they were talking about. I really wannted to show the new worker that he was wrong.

The first reason is that all this time from when they first took the picture to the last time they took the picture it has never been touched or even looked like it was messed by anyone. Proving that the so called ""human face made by aliens"" was not only unrealistic but also doubting Nasa, who has been in work since the first time the United states landed on the moon. Reason two, why would you be doubting a group when they have been working on new technoligy for modern space traveling for a long time. Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the ""human Face"". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do. Nasa even had qualified scientists to make sure it was't an alien face and even confirmed it. The third reason is because on April 5, 1998 when Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped pictures ten times sharper and confirmed it was just a natural landform.

Most people believed this, but not everyone. they figured the coordinents 41 degrees north martian latitude. In April of 1998 it was winter at the time, which is the time of year Mars becomes cloudy. This means the camera on board had to look through wispy clouds, which could hide some of the evidence. Finally on April 8, 2001 they got a clearer view for another picture. They find out that the picture is equivalent to a butte or messa. Garvin sasy it reminds him of the MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He says that the lava dome is about the height as the face of mars.

In conclusion the mysterious face was never actaully said to be Alien markings of a pile of Rocks with weird shadows. According to the study the closest thing to have is figuring it out is the pictures. Will we ever find out what the mysterious face is?",4,1,0.8594340682029724
f847d94,"Now there hasnt been real information on the existence of aliens or any other lifeforms of that kind. Stories behind those creatures are usually made up by many people. We dont have any evidence as to seeing or taking pictures of any aliens or UFO's. So why would aliens be on Mars?

Due to the fact that researchers have identified that the ""Face"" is juast a mesa, I think is safe to say that there are no alien life forms on mars and there never was.

Nasa has very good cameras that are way better than the ones in 1976. They can zoom in way more and take 3-D images as well. if there were aliens living on there you would be able to see UFO's and a whole lot of aliens on the planet. And if there were Egyptioan style pyramids or even small shacks you would be able to see them to. The ""Face"" is a martian equivalent to a butte or mesa as scientifically proven by scientist.

Another reason as to why the mesa on mars is a landform and not some alien made artifact is that in the article it said that there were shadowns giving off the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. ""Its a good way to enage the public and attract attention to mars"", as said in the story. Also making the Face a pop icon also would make more people think that there really is life on mars without any real evidence. The face appeared on movies and magazines, which made more and more people follow this trend of life on mars.

The final reason as to why the object on mars is just a landform and not an alien made thing is that on a cloudy, wispy day, the photo was taken. Making it seem like the aliens did it on purpose. But, scientist took the photo again on a less cloudier day and found out that is was just a landfrom after all. when they shot it with their better camera, it showed that is was just made by mars just like earth makes its own lanforms sometimes. So it seems as though technology from back then just wasnt updated enough to get the job done.

Ultimately, the reason that evryone thought that there were life on mars is because technology wasnt as evolutionized as it was in 2001 compared to 1976. With the technology today, we would be able to find out right away if there were actually life on mars. So in conclusion, there is not life on mars and there never was.

I believe that this is real. No not the alien part but the face it's was fomred by natural landforms. Land forms can be created at any given moment - but this certain one just seemd to catch someone's eyes.

So on April 5, 1998 Michael and his Mars Orbiter camera took a shot of the ""face"" that made it look 10 times bigger than it was the viewers were shocked.

Better stated in pargraph one, ""An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camera from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia."" On this beautiful reddish planet, people thought there was a human face carved in it. They do not know how, and they do not know who did it.

What did people see on this great sized planet? People saw a face, with shadows forming human face features! After Nasa had generously let the images on display for everyone to see, it became a huge news story. Everyone was, as said, talking about the unspecified ""Face on Mars"". The word was soon sent out by everyone ,and the public was attract to what they had seen in the picture of mars! The public went balistic after seeing such an amazing picture!

What did NASA and scientists say about this human looking face? They had said it was just a natural created landform! When they flew over the beautiful Cydonia to snap a better picture of ""The Face"" that was sharper, they had said, ""There was no alien monument after all."" Not everyone had agreed with what they had said, which cause a comotion. Other people had said they were clearly oblivious to the alien markings hidden by the haze. Which then, NASA had to send more people to look at the face once more.

What had happened the second time they send people to search ""The Face."" Well, they had a little bit of trouble this time around! They had said, it was not easy, and It had been very hard work. They also said, in paragraph 9, ""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" Next, they found a great cloudless summer day to finally search Cydonia. There team had caught an ""Extraordinary photo usimg the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Their picture had been 100x better the second time around! They stated, ""Well, If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion, If were unseen aliens on Cydonia, they would most likely know about it! It would have been very,very clear to see aliens after they used their 1.56 meter pixel size.

The first picture of the ""Face on Mars"" was taken by Viking 1 spacecraft. It was looking for a landing spot for its sister ship, then made out the shadowy aperance of a face. While this did shock scientists, it didn't last. They put down as just another Martian landform, it's only special charateristic being it looked like a ancient egyptian pharoah. Later the Mars Global Surveyor took another snapshot, the picture being ten times sharper than the orginal. To reveal nothing but a nautral land form. It was actually a mesa, a land form or lava dome.

The ""Face on Mars"" was not alien monument or even an actual face. It was a bunch of shadows and just in general a low pixelated picture.         ",2,1,0.9339653253555298
f8cdfe5,"In 1976 a strange humanlike face was found on Mars by NASA's Viking 1. A giant face almost two miles long was thought to be created by aliens. But NASA scientists thought differently.

I believe that the face is a natural ladform as well as NASA. Becsause the NASA scientists proved it was a mesa and that they had no reason to cover up alien life.

The face was found in one of the regions of Mars called Cydonia. Scientists were in shock at first, but they stated that it was a Martian mesa even though a face like structure was seen in the pictures. A couple days afterward the formation was unveiled for the public to see and they went insane over the images.

The conspiracy theroies piled up as some stated that the pictures were perfect evidence of life on Mars. NASA's budget only wished that there was actual life on Mars but knew all to well there was no life on Mars. Only a handful of NASA scientists thought of this as an alien artifact, but getting more pictures of it was a top priority for NASA. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. Thousands of web surfers were waiting for the image to appear on a JPL web site. There wasn't an alien monument. But all it did was reveal a natural landform.

I was thrillled when I read this becuase it proved my hypothesis correct. But there were still some people who werent satisfied by the images. Some people claimed that there was a haze that kept the alien markings hidden. On April 8, 2001 on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. Using the cameras highest resolution it took a picture of the face. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program stated As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, also he said So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

The face on Mars had captivated people's imagination for years. Wheather in a movie, books, magazines, or even in the gossip magazines. Aleins creating face just doesnt seem logical enough for NASA scientists or for me.

f8db3e1,"When people first say this ""face"" it was from a picture that the Viking 1 spacecraft took. Additional reasearch and pictures have been done to see if this is actually a face, just a huge rock formation, or an alien monument. It has shown that it is just a huge rock.

I say its only a huge rock because the passage mentions unusual shadows. THese shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth causing it to look like a face. They did not just form any

""face"" that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So we know now that t was just a huge rock formation with shadows on it. It is not an actual face carved into rock.

The passage mentions that Michel Malin and his MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the same landform only ten times shaper thn the original. When they looked at this picture it revealed a natural landform. So after all this it wasnt an alie monument after all.

Now the image doesnt show a face and its not an alien monument it is a butte or mesa. Those are commo landforms aroung the american west.

f90d665,"Why do you believe the face was created by aliens? When looking at this image, you can think about that at first but if you believe it immediately, then there is something wrong about that. I will explain to you why the face was not created by aliens though i will also explain why someone may believe that.

The face is an image we found in 2001 that was taken by our Viking 1 spacecraft that was circling the Mars. The face is an area of land on Mars that has the illusion of a face. The illusion of the face comes from the shadows making the land look like it has a nose, eyes, and a mouth that resembles a human face. It was a surprise for most people here at NASA but we didn't believe it was alien works immediately because we didn't have any real evidence of it. It just so happened to be a patch of land that looked like a face.

We couldn't say it was made by aliens because we needed proof of that and we haven't studied Mars' enough to prove that aliens made the face. We know Mars is similar to Earth but it's still a different planet in our solar system. Although we hoped it might've been an alien civilization, we studied the face more and it was simply a landform similar to a mesa or butte of our world.

Even though we know it was just a landform, there are reasons we could see people saying it might've been made by aliens. We know Mars is able to sustain life because of it's conditions and there has been few deposits of water found there, but we have never found an actual living species on the planet itself. We as humans still don't know if aliens live on Mars or if aliens from other worlds exist at all. Many people believe there are aliens from other planets and some don't really care about the subject at all but it is possible that there's life on other planets.

Because we haven't figured out if Mars has life, people believe the strange and convinient findings on Mars (like the face) are works of alien beings. Although we have confirmed the face was not a work of aliens, we still don't know if aliens exist. We can conclude that the face is not the work of aliens but there just might be unearthly beings on our neighboring planet, Mars. Before we can confirm there are alien beings on Mars, we would need evidence to explain they do exist at all. But we can conclude, the face is not made by aliens.",4,1,0.9146864414215088

The first pieace of edivence are the picture that were taken by Viking 1 and MGS, Mars Global Survey. In 1976 it looks like a face, but we didn't have the technology that we have. The first picture was 43 meters per pixel, which is a lot. Now if this technology advance we now get 1.56 meters per pixel, so if the face on Mars was really set up by aliens we would see their huts or anything else they built. The second piece of edivence is shadows, as you can see in the pictures it is just how the sun is position and how the statlite is postion to make it look like a face. The last reason is other natural sites that have the same size and looks like the face on Mars. The face on Mars reminds the Auroth of a place in Idaho. It is a Butte in the Snake river Plain. It is almost the same size and shape.

In conclusion the face of Mars is a natural site, and not made by aliens. I know because of the picture of the face of Mars. The new technology we used to get a better look at it. Lastly how other natural sites look like the face of Mars.  ",3,1,0.8946765065193176
f949f3c,"An unusual face was spotted by Viking 1 in 1976. Looking at evidence that were provided, it shows that the ""unusual face"" found on Mars was just a mistake. Even though they had picture of the unusual face the first time they spotted, it was a really blurry one so it created illusions for people to make it look like there was actually a face on there. It was later proven by Mars Global Surveyor that it was just a natural landform on Mars using photography. Therefore, pictures don't lie which makes the ""unusual face"" just another natural landform.

In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, where the unusual face was found, to snap a picture of the unusual face which was ten times sharper than the Viking photos. Since the picture was pretty clear, it reveal what was actually there on Mar's surface. It proved that it was just a natural landform and that it wasn't any alien monument. People may say that since it's winter it was the cloudy time to of the year of for Mars so other things such as clouds could've had an effect on the picture but it doesn't change the fact that it's just a landform no matter how unsatified the people were.

In addition, NASA unveiled the image saying that it was just a huge rock formation. They noted that it resembles a human head because of the shadows. It was creating illusions for human eyes so they didn't see the actual object but instead they saw a face on Mars. Although, some scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact which was what got Mars Glbal Surveyor to even begin taking pictures of Mars to prove that it was just a natural landform. Overall, the face on Mars is just an illusion even though some people believe it's real.

However, people might think it's real. Looking at the evidence provided by the Vikings which was the first photo of the face on Mars, it really resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. Even a few scientist believed that it was an alien artifact and it even became a pop icon. It was starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines and radio talk shows which mean people actually believed it. The face on Mars attracted many people's attention. Which is why people could say it's real since the majority believes it but what really matter is how it's proven. It was proven using a camera that snap pictures clearly. Everyone was later informed that it was just a natural landformed because of the picture taken in 2001.

In conclusion, the face found on Mars was just a natural landform that looked like a face because of a blurry picture taken by the Vikings in 1976. Many scientists and people believed that it was real but it was just an illusion to the human eyes. In 2001, Marlin's team took a snap of the face on Mars which prove that it was just a natural landform. Garvin compared it to the landforms on Earth so that people could understand and believe that it was just a natural landform.

The Viking 1 gathered the first pictures of the face ever. Many conspiracy theorists think that NASA knows that it is evidence of an ancient alien race. It still remains somewhat a mystery to people all over the internet.

The Viking one captured the first pictures of the face in history. It was searching for landing spot for it's sister ship. The mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised when it popped up on their monitors. The pictures surfaced on the internet a few days later. It was a great way to get people engaged in the attraction to Mars.

Although NASA and conspiracy theorists would be happy to discover that the face is evidence of an ancient alien race on Mars. The formation is probably just a mesa or a butte. They are both landforms common to the American West. Garvin commented'' It reminds me of a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.''A lava dome that takes form of a mesa around t he same height as the one Mars.

If the face on mars was an alien artifact NASA would be famous for finding it.

Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding the fact that the face is an alien artifact,but NASA would not be hiding the fact that it is from aliens if it were because it would benefit them a bunch. For example they could make a ton of money from the publicity of it being something alien. With the money they could fund even more projects like sending rovers to Mars to try and find out more about the face, and maybe they could even be able to get humans to Mars. It would get people interested in Mars and they would want more pictures and evidence of it being an alien artifact. That is why it would not make sence for NASA to tell people on the internet that the face is an something alien instead of just being a mesa or a butte.

In conclusion there is a lot more evidence that the face is a mesa or a butte other than an alien artifact. Even though conspiracy theorists are convinced they have proof of alien lifeform. Most evidence points to it being a landform, like a mesa or a butte. There is also not any logical reason for NASA to hide the idea that it is evidence of aliens if it were true.

fa29121,"Hello my name is Mr. Baker with NASA, and we are discussing the landform that looks like a face on mars.

This is a landform not an alien marking.

There are known to be little life of aliens.

In fact this landform looks a lot similiar to a natural landmark in Idaho.

But over the last eighteen years scientists at NASA has been studying this landmark for all of this time.

There is no more evidence that it was an alien.

Because there is not a body for this creature unless the planet covered it up and made the body into ashes.

This landform is very unique.

It looks like a face but over the years the picture does not look the same.

Perhaps it was a alien or something extraordinary.

But over the caorse of time the landmark has built up to look like a face.

The pictures from 1998 look way different because of the technology of then and now.

If you look real closely to the pictures you can tell that over the time period that the landform turned from a bunch of scattered dust into a pile that looks like a face, but it is actually not.

Reaserchers say this could be an alien, but I belive not because not one person has found an alien that was alive.

Aliens have been a myth for quite some time now and no one has really ever seen one.

Mars is a landform that is made up of a bunch of different materials and minerals.

Over time there could have been some solar wind and some of the landform blew away and made it look like a face.

From what the photos show people is a face that looks like a human or some kind of life form, and in 1998 the photo shows that it looks like an egyptian pharaoh.

But over time the land mass has changed so if we waited even longer it will change over time.

And over the coarse of another decade or so it will be changed.

Or if the land mass was touched it might break up the loose materials and the landform will be different.

So at the NASA corperation they study the material and the evidence real close.

It might be proven to be a land mass or another source of life somewhere else.

But for all we know right now it is a landmark until someone has proof it is wrong information. So NASA will keep studying the information they have.

Also NASA is trying to develop more information about this landmark. But until then this is known to be a landmark.

So until then this meeting is pronounced over.",3,1,0.8325619101524353

fa3640b,"In 1976, the so called ""Face on Mars"" was first photographed by Viking 1. Scientists were initially surprised at the appearance of the Face, but soon concluded the it was nothing more than a Martian mesa. Some conspiracy theorists deduct that the Face signifies alien life on Mars. Life that NASA has decided to keep secret. This is incorrect. NASA would have no benefit from hiding evidence of life on Mars. The expeditions to survey the landmark cost severely. Furthermore, in 2001, Mars Global Surveyor captured a detailed photo of the Face, showing that the mysterious landmark is nothing more than a Martian butte or mesa. Also, the landmark resembles that of landforms common in the American West.

The ""Face"" found on Mars lead many to conclude that Mars can in fact support life. Many also believe that NASA would rather keep this life secret. Both of these claims are false. If there truly were life on Mars, NASA would have no motivation to keep it secret. The expeditions to survey the landmark require heavy funding and millions of dollars in assets. NASA would have this issue concluded, rather than to continue to spend millions to survey the Face. There is also conclusive evidence found in pictures captured by Mars Global Surveyor that show the Face to be nothing more than a Martian butte of mesa. The photos depict the landmark as nothing special. In fact, Earth has similiar landforms found in the American West.

The ""Face on Mars"" is not evidence of alien life. NASA would not lie to protect evidence that could save them millions of dollars.

This statement would lead anyone to believe that the details and magnification in a camera 25 years younger and improved would lead to better and more eye capsuring photos right?

Right.

So, why would there be controversey over the likelyhood of the face actually being real?

Here's why: people see something one time and they are automatically drawn into the idea that it has to be real. The Martian Mesa was said to look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. That statement leads people to believe that there had to be life to build something like that. But, with the shadow showing groves perfectly and the holes in the mesa made it look real. The ""Face"" is just another Mesa on Mars.

First, the pixels and the picture produced by the camera at that time weren't as developed as the camera used in 2001. You also have to take into account that, as time goes on, most products will be improved and made better, in this case that's how it was with the cameras, with a 25 year gap in between.

The text says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" The text also supports the claim by stating, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

Additionally, the shadows had appeared to be hitting the natural landform just right. The scientists belive this because, they have seen many other mesas while traveling in space, this on just happened to have a interesting impression at first sight.

The text proves this by including, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusoin of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

The text also says, There must have been a degree of spurise amoung mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

Believers in this ""face"" may claim there was never a clear picture of the ""face"" taken after the first photo.

To support this they may think that the photographer taking the picture may not be able to see the clouds. The text says, ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 - a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to the Face.""

However, NASA was able to take another picture of the Face when the clouds weren't in the way and it wasn't winter. The text says, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 - a cloudless summer day in Cydonia - MGS drew close enough for a second look. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""

The Face captured on Mars has proven to be a natural landform. With shadows covering it and dips to make facial features it can across as an Egyptian Pharaoh. This is proven because, of the high tech cameras and the shadows only lasted one day allowed scientists to prove their claim - the Face was just a normal mesa landform.",5,1,0.7711615562438965
fa87d4a,"Many people disagree with myself and the rest of NASA about the Face found on Mars. This paper is to all who are still trying to say that the face was made by aliens. For one, this conspiracy theory has very little evidence to support it. In the following paragraphs you will find facts and educational proof that this Face is really just a landform and was not made by aliens.

To begin, I will bring up background on what you think about how the Face was created by aliens. Many people, like you, believe that NASA is hiding the fact that the Face is bona fide, evidence of life on Mars. For evidence of this Face not being constructed by aliens, we took a picture that revealed a natural landform, and not an alien monument. But apparently this picture did not satisfied everyone. You all seem to think that since the picture was taken in winter when it was cloudy, that alien markings were hidden behind clouds and haze. To prove, once again, that you were wrong, our mission controllers prepared to look again. Finally on April 8, 2001, we drew close for another look at the Face, this time on a cloudless summer day. Our team captured an amazing photo, each pixel in the image spanned 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. JIm Garvin, our cheif scientist, finally stated that if there were objects in the picture, you could tell what they were! Even after proving you all wrong to your theories, people like you still believe we are hiding the truth from you. In the next paragraph you will see that we really are telling you all the facts!

If you are still reading, and you still believe that my NASA team and I are not telling you the facts, here are some things you should know that might just make you think again. In the previous paragraph I told and showed you that everytime you brought back your theory, we had picture proof to prove you wrong. In this paragraph I am refering back to past facts, but I am also going to being giving you more proof. Use this proof to realize that my NASA group has absolutely no reason to lie to anyone about the Face. To begin, I want to tell you that we have no reason to hide an ancient civilization on Mars. If our group were to have found an ancient or alien civilization, we would have gladly made it public. Keeping something that big, hidded, would not only be highly difficult, but it would benefit us in no way, shape, or form. To be perfectly honest, defenders of the NASA budget and I wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. If there were to be, we would make lots of money from this discovery. But since there is not a civilization, I will move back on track to my final facts about why and not what if. In all, we have many photos of the Face, all proving that it is in fact just a natural landform. We have hightech shots that would show if there were alien objects like pyramids, shacks, or airplanes. But none of these pictures show anything. In fact, they show the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Jim Garvin, our very reliable chief scientist, even states that the Face looks very similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.

As conclusion to this paper I just want to review over the facts showing that this Face is not an alien or ancient civilization. The Face is just a natural landform. My group and I have no reason to hide any facts from anyone, in fact if there were a civilization it would benefit us tremendously. There is physical proof this ""alien"" Face is not alien at all. I hope this essay helps you to understand that NASA and I are not hiding anything, and the Face, in fact, is just a neat looking natural landform on a planet we have yet to discover completely.",4,1,0.9214375019073486
faaa141,"In the Story ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" The face on mars has apparently been founded in 1976, NASA claimed the the face was formed by a alien, Here is were I come in, The world had made a bunch of movies including aliens from mars, Mars, for hundreds maybe thousands of years have been the 'Aliens home'. Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution.

That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.

huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. huge rock formation...."" It basically says that the rock is a formation "".......giving the illusion......"" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth. I clearly gives out that opinion that if you put it together you get ""A huge rock formations giving the illusion........."" and so on.

I also think that The 'face' Is just a rock the looks like a face, clearly I stated that. Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ...""over time it transformed ....."" in the text... ""Huge rock FORMation."" It is just a rock thats looks like a face, and just because it's on mars don't mean a thing.",3,1,0.9156306385993958

The pictures revealed the same thing as the Viking 1 spacecraft.

The shadows naturally being formed by the rocks is the only thing that gives the land formation the illusion of a face. The text states that the public was shown a picture that was taken on a camera's absolute maximum resolution on a cloudless summer day. The picture revealed a natural landform that was equivalent to a butte or mesa. As for the conspiracy theories of NASA, they would not hide the situation of there being life forms on Mars. The text states, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

People woud not rest until we got a really good look at what the image was. It only took NASA 25 years to give the public a really good picture and it was obviously a natural landfrom.

Some people think the face on Mars is an alien artifact. Although a few number of people think it is an alien artifact, it's actually not. The face is just another boring old natural landform. There was an image captured on the Mars Orbiter Camera of the face and it revealed it was a natural landform. The image first appeared on a website called JPL web site.

There are lots of different opinions about whether it is an actual face or just a landform. Conspiracy theorists say the NASA would hide the ""real"" truth about the Face. They also say that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Evidence and a lot of pictures suggest that it is a natural landform. Specificly three or more pictures and many very smart scientists.

After the first image was shown to the public in 1976 it became a national hit in America. The Face on Mars has become a pop icon since that day. It was in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even a Hollywood film! There have also been a lot of arguments about what the face actually is. In 2001 there was another picture taken of the same face and it became clear to the scientists and the public that the face is a natural landform.

A NASA scientist, Jim Garvin, said the face just looked like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also said that the camera that took the picture of the face in 2001, is so good that 'you can dicern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.' Garvin said,"" If there were objects n this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even samll shacks you could see what they were.""

Martian mesa's are pretty common in Cydonia, and this is the only one that had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Then, they said that the shadows made it look like it had a nose, eyes, and mouth.

The first web site the Face ever appeared on was JPL web site. It showed a natural land form, and no alien monument after all. However, Alien Researchers believe that since MGS had to peer through whispy clouds to see the face that alien markings were hidden by the haze. Because of this, Mission controllers took a second trip. They took better pictures than the Viking photo and had great results.

Garvin was the Mission Controller in command and he points out that that things in a digital come up three times bigger than the original image. He also says, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what the were!"" He tells us that this is rule of thumb and that he knows what he is doing because this is his job.

fbb4c9d,"If aliens really exsisted wouldn't we know by now? Reasons on why the mark on mars is not a face, is because our technology, scientific facts, and oursafety. Going into detail i will tell you more reasons on why this is a natural land form.

The mark on mars is a natural land mark, because our technology is advanced in so many ways. First, since the day we have found the mark we have advanced in technology. We have grown, and have more machines that can help determine what it is. Another example is that the technology we have is supposed to determine, and help figure out what certain things are. This example shows that with the technology we have is really advance therefor by now wouldn't you think we could be able to determin what the mark is? Atlast another example would be how the technology we have we can determin weather its a living artifact or not. This example shows that how far we have come since we have found it we would know what it really is. The reason on why the mark on mars is not put there by aliens is because the advancement in technology.

Another reason the land mark on mars is not put there by aliens is because scientific facts. An example would be how scientists can determine weather it is a land form or not. This example shows if the mark can be proven as a land form it cannot be put there by aliens. Another example is that a land mark comes in many different shapes and sizes. This example shows that is can come in the appearence of a face, but that doesn't mean it is one. Atlast is because scientist have already determined what the shape is. In the story it says ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigt as the face on mars."" The reason the mark on mars wasnt b an alien becaus it has been scientificaly proven to be a mesa.

Atlast the reason the mark on mars is not a mak from the aliens is because our safety. First an example would be the government would inform us if aliens were proven to be on mars. This example shows that we have a right to know weather or not there are aliens. Next, another example would be because if it can be proven to be something els than we would be told. This shows that if the mark can be identified by scientists that its a natural land mark than it would be told to be a natural land mark. Atlast is because we would be more aware and secure with the world. We would be more frightened and want to keep the world domed and blocked so no creatures are able to enter the world. The reason the

mark is not b an alien is because the world would know by now.

The face (Mesa) on mars has been scientifically proven to just be a natural land mark. The reasons it can be proven is by our technology, scientific studies, and our safety.",4,1,0.580560564994812

It also says that few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact so if it's not that and that have other evidence it has to be a natual artifact.

The Face is very similar to natural artifacts here on Earth. In the story it talks about a place in idaho that is very similar to the Face. It also says it looks very much like a lava dome.

The pictures the very nice camera took of the Face is proof that they do look alike and that it is just a natural artifact.

The face on Mars was not created by aliens. Although it may look that way, the face is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The same landforms are common around the American West. In Cydonia, the area where the photographs were taken, butte's and mesa's are common. The Martian mesa has wierd shadowing on the top which, caused it to look like a face.

It looked almost like a human face. You would think that alliens would make something radical and not just a face in their planet. Many people seem to believe that they would make something simple.

Eventhough many people were not satisfied with the theory that NASA gave them, NASA went on to search for more clues as to which ""alliens made the landform."" From the pictures that they took you would think that they would be able to detect whether alliens even walked/ touched the surface of the landform.

If you think that alliens made the landform, I would suggest you look at the picture more closely. Just because its on a planet like mars doesnt mean it was made by an allien. I mean how many people actually believe in alliens anyway? If you've never seen them how do you know if they even exist? Take another quick look at the picture tell what you think. Is it even possible for alliens to be alive even if it is on another planet?

fc5aa1b,"Can you believe that there is a face on Mars!? The Face on Mars is actually not a face but a natural landform for the following reasons, the facial features are just shadows, there isn't any real proof that aliens created it, and scientists have research that is proof of it not being alien-made.

The first reason is the facial features are just shadows. It would be nice if it was actually nad by an alien. Sadly, it isn't true. It is proven that it is actually just a huge rock formation. (Paragraph 3) ""The authors reasoned it would be good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. (Paragraph 3)

Secondly, there isn't actual proof that aliens created it anyways. There isn't any proof that aliens are even completely real. It is said in the article ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" (Paragraph 8). So, they do not have any actual real proof.

My last reason is that scientists have done research to prove that aliens did not really creat this face in Mars. Scientists had seen this photeo in the winter of April '98. Someone would have to peer through the camera through wispy clouds. (paragraph 8).

The reasoning for believing aliens did it is that people want to believe. They want to believe that another race of people can exsist. Maybe the aliens are jsut sending a message that they are real. Wem will never really know for sure sadly.

You can belioeve what you would like to. I believe that the face is just a landmark because the facial features on the face is just a few shadows, scientists have done research on this case, and there isn't really any proof that aliens created it. You may believe what you would like to. But, do you want to believe in something real or made up? ",3,1,0.8857926726341248
fc7b015,"The conspiracy about aliens has been starting to go too far. An isolated mesa was found on Mars, but when its picture was taken, it looked like a face. The conspiracy theorists have been thinking that that's the proof that there's life on Mars, but they're wrong. The picture was taken in 2001, which means it was very detailed, so it would've been obvious if there were any tombs or buildings surrounding the mesa. Also, it only looks like a face because of it shadows. The shadows actually shape it into a face. Finally, if it was actually a sign for alien life, it would've profited NASA, so there wouldn't be a point in hiding the ""truth"" that the conspiracy theorists believe. These all show that the Face is just an ordinary rock.

The last picture of the Face was taken in 2001. This was a very detailed picture, even for being taken so long ago. Each pixel in the image was equal to 1.56 meters in real life. This means that any other nearby buildings or tombs would've been seen near the rock. There weren't any buildings or any sign of actual alien life nearby, so the picture at least proved that the Face wasn't a sign from the aliens, but just a rock.

The only reason that the Face looks so much like a face is because of the shadows. Without the shadows, the Face might just look like an ordinary rock on mars. The shadows themself give the illusion of the rock having eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Those shadows are the only reason that the Face IS

the Face.

Without those shadows, the Face wouldn't be so famous. Nobody would have probably ever known or cared about it.

The conspiracy theorists and many people in general probably think that NASA is hiding the fact that aliens are real, so they're lying about the Face and just saying that it's a landform, when they think it's a sign that aliens exist. That's not true. NASA is a company that needs money like all the rest. They know that telling people that aliens were real would profit them a lot, so they wouldn't just hide the fact that the Face was an alien artifact if it was one. NASA probably wishes that they had found an ancient cililization on Mars, just for the profit.

The theorists are wrong about the Face being an ancient artifact. The latest picture of the Face is so detailed, that any ancient civilizations nearby would be visible. Also, the Face is only the Face because the rock has shadows along it that makes it look like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Finally, NASA would proabably like to find an ancient civilization on Mars, just so that they could profit from finding something related to alien life. They wouldn't just hide the truth if they could gain money from it. Therefore, theorists should just realize that facts are facts, and that if NASA finds an ancient civilization on Mars, they'll tell everyone.",5,1,0.8103313446044922
fc9f684,"You really think that the Face was created by aliens? Well I do not think that. First of all there is no evidence that aliens even exsist. Second of all, there is no evidence that it was created by aliens at all, it is just a conspiracy therory. Also another example would be that it says in the paragraph that is just a landform. I believe that the Face is just a landform, like the ones on earth.

My first example that the Face wasn't created my aliens would be, there is no evidence that aliens even exsisted ever. There is no evidence in the passage but it is just a known belief that aliens have never existed at all, in the history of ever.

Another example that i believe would be that, yet again there is no evidence that the aliens (that don't exsist) even made that. For instance, in paragraph six it states,"" Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact.....""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" This example shows that even few scientist believe that the aliens created it. NASA still tried to prove that it wasn't made by the aliens that don't exsist.

My last reason I believe that the Face wasn't made by aliens would be that, the Face was proven to be just like the landforms on Earth, and we didn't shape those. For example, in paragraph twelve it states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,""

says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

This example shows that it was proven that the Face is just like landforms on Earth.

In conclusion, these three examples show why I believe that the Face was not made by aliens. It is just a landform, like the ones on Earth. There is no evidence that aliens even exist. There is no evidence that aliens created the Face. Also it was proven that the Face is just like landforms on Earth. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. ",4,1,0.752583384513855
fce1e83,"Have you ever heard of ""The Face on Mars""? At NASA, we believe that the face is just a natural landform on mars. The face is a natural landmark that was discrovered on Mars. Nasa sometimes sends out intelligent drones to take an adventure on Mars. The drones explore parts of the planet, bringing back information of new landscapes or discoveries. The Face gets explored by the drones and the drones always send new information back about the glamorous and unique landmark. Some people even believe that the Face was created by Aliens.

In addition the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" article, provides us various details that support my claim of the Face just being a landmarks. Twenty-five years before May 24th of 2001, scientists from NASA discorvered this landmark, that not long after, went viral. Citzens in the country made up theories of the Face and how it somehow is an alien making and the individuals chose not to believe the intelligent individuals over at NASA's space center who say it is simply a mesa. Most people are smart enough to have the knowledge of Aliens and how their non-exisitent to the galaxy. The world would defintley be terminated and in trouble, if more people believed in aliens versus, those who do not believe.

Do you belive in aliens? If Mars did have aliens, where are their houses at? What are there water sources but where are their shelter aswell? Zero gravity is two extravagant words to describe Mars. Think about this, on earth we have gravity and it hold us down versus living on Mars floating through out the galaxy.

Would their be little alien babies playing with astroids in the air?

Even though, some might think that aliens made the Face because of all the alien markings and sucipisious sounds, at NASA we believe that their are no aiens. The Face is a masterpiece made from a mesa, not silly non-earthly creatures. To create such an artwork, the aliens woud have had to be seen while constructing the glamorous landmark.

Overall, aliens did not create the landmark, it was created by a mesa. In the United States Of America, there are many landmarks that people would say would be created by aliens, if they landed on Mars. The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, potrays something very simuliar to the Face. If you think that the Face was created by aliens does that mean you believe all of the simuliar landmarks such as the one in Idaho that is on United States territory were created by aliens too?

At NASA, we have completed various amounts of research to know that the Face was not created by Aliens.  ",4,1,0.8242743611335754

I'll also do an introduction, a body, and a conclusion to my argumentative essay. I'll will do this in order to my arguement for this essay and I'll first start with my arguement of the scientist or person of the Face being created by aliens and then I'll support it with evidence from the article and last I'll ended it with refreshing of what I was talking about in the essay.

I'll tell the person that thinks that the Face being created by aliens by saying that how will the Face be created by aliens if they would make more of those faces. We humans make building and later on make better or different than before and do think they should have made it bigger or different than before because it has been 25 years since that Face has been there and mothing has change from it but only of how we took the picture. The Face from paragraph 5 shows the face and looks like it had a nose, mouth and eyes from the picture. I can support all of this details from telling you that in paragraph that it said that "" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possilbe landing sites for its sister ship,"" the reason I told you this is because if the spacecraft was taking photos of the planet then it could of took a photo of an alien or other more of the Face. They been circling the planet to take the photos in 1976, 1998 and 2001 they done this and they never seen the alien or more Faces.

So I was able to show of what to tell to the person if the any person said if it was created by the aliens. Also I was able to tell what would say and gave evidence to the person from the article. I did the introduction, body and conclusion to the essay and made sure if I put of what to be sure to include in this essay. I also check the checklist of any mistake I'd put on the essay or forgot to put in the essay. That is all of what to put in this essay to make sure I got everything to finish this essay.",3,1,0.6330021619796753
fd2bd08,"Many years ago there was said to be a face on mars. Research since have proved that the so called face was just a natural landform. There are such landforms like a mesa that the scientists think is what the face really is. People today still do not believe scientists that the so called face is just a landform. I think people should believe that its a natural landform, because scientists have improved their cameras, scientists know more on the topic then civilians do, and people assumed and over exaggerated too quickly.

Scientists have improved there pictures since the Viking 1 took the photo. They have better quality and have done some more research. The aricle says that there cameras have improved and been upgraded. The scientists say that there are several options that the mound could be. Two options are a mesa and a butte.

The people do not know as much as the scientists do. The scientists have done research and gone to school over this type of thing. They can identify it easily. In the article one said that the landfrom looks common to some in the American West. They compared it to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This shows that the people have less knowledge in this area then scientists do.

People over exaggerated it when they first found out anyway. They weren't positive that it was what they thought it was. The aritcle stated that right away people made movies, stories, and articles about it. The picture shows on the Viking 1 that it was just shadows. The newer pictures were shown to not really show facial features. Yes people could see the figure of a face, but its outrageous to think that an alien formed such thing.

These facts show that it is highly unlikely to have an alien form such thing. There is more proof that it is a natural landform. But would you want people getting all excited and happy because they THOUGHT an alien existed. Its also just a way to get children to believe foolish things and maybe even give them nightmares.

fd56afe,"I disagree that in this photo, the ""face"" is made by an alien artifact. I believe that this face is just another natural platform. I also believe thier is no sign living of aliens on Mars. My reasons are first, NASA are a real organization that put research in the image, while the conspiricy theirist are connot be highly credible. Also, in the passage, it said on April 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original, revealing a natural landform.

In my first reason, for a long time, NASA had found the face on 1976, showing the photo to all to see. Scientist figured it was another Martian mesa, comming enough around Cydonia. Yet, only that photo have unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian. Later in years, as the photo became well known NASA put more research as they already done. But when they show that it was a natural platform, not all people was satisfied, Making conspiricy thiorist saying that NASA is hiding a secret about the face on Mars was made by an alien.

In my other reason, On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbit Camera, (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than than first photo in '76. After taking the picture, Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting, the image was first put up on a JPL website, revealing a natural platform.

At the end, NASA will never tried to hide somthing this important to everybody. They wasn't sure what it was at first, so years after research, they snapped a ten times shapper image of the face and was found out to be a natural landform.",3,1,0.9218984842300415

Earth has water so humans, animals and plants can survive but not Mars. The picture in the passage looks like a face but it could just be a bump on the planet that somehow looked like a face.

At some point Mars might of had living creatures but not anymore. I personally think that Mars might have had something living thousands or hundreds of years ago.

fd8019a,"On May 24, 2001 something strange happened on Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft circled the planet, looking for possible landing sites for Viking 2, when it captured a human face lurking on the ground of Mars. An enormous head seemed to stare back at the cameras from Cydonia. The NASA scientists soon found out it was not an alien marking. The Face is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa.

To begin, The Face natural landform is not the only Martian mesa in Cydonia. This region of Mars is actually quite common for having these weird Martian mesas. This mesa was different from the others with ""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh(2)."" This information led to the research of an ancient civilization on Mars. The research found that there was not an ancient civilization, although many people wish their would have been.

Since many people wanted to find an ancient civilization, conspiracy theorists hoped to prove NASA wrong. The theorists began to throw false accusations at NASA including, ""Some people think the Face is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists(5)."" NASA defenders stated that they wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars and that they would not lie. NASA flew over Cydonia once again and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the originial Viking photos. The picture proved that it was just a natural landform. This didn't stop the conspiracy theorists from pushing forward.

To conclude, the theorists believed that since there was a haze on Mars when they took the photo, that the haze could potentially hide ancient Martian markings. This kept NASA pushing harder into their research. ""Neverless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look(10)."" NASA rolled the spacecraft to center the Face in the field of view. They took a picture with extraordinary resolution. If anyone could see anything they could see it. NASA concluded that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa- landforms commonly found in the American West.

The Face is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. The trips NASA took around Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform commonly found in Cydonia. The Face is a giant rock plated with shadows for eyes, nose, and a mouth. Consiracy theorists still may believe that their was an ancient cicilization, but NASA indeed showed them wrong.

Some people would like to belive that there were once human like creatures living on the Red Planet. Also known as Mars. They believe that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens. As stated in paragraph 1 it says Viking 1 has spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face as it was looking for possible landing sites for VIking 2. That does't truly mean that there were aliens living there. Many people may say they have expierenced aliens. But have they really?

I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a simple natural landform. In paragraph 8 it states that it is a very cloudy time in the month of April for the Red Planet. If no one belives that then possibly they could check again. It is very difficlut to scan a planet. More than difficlut, it is a job that will take a certain amount of time, but it is sometimes worth it. I don't believe that aliens are real. I also don't belive that Mars is a Planet that is to be liveable on. In paragraph 1 it says the ""Face on Mars"" was an ""enormouse head that was nearly two miles for end to end.""

fdeac71,"Landform, Not Aliens

The ""face"" on Mars has been a topic of discussion for almost twenty-five years. Was it created by an unknown species of aliens? Definitely not. Although, some people do think that, the ""face"" on Mars is actually just a natural landform that happened to be shaped like a face. Obviously, the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform, not something created by aliens.

To begin, the ""face"" on Mars is just a natural landform. What else could it be? Some say it was a statue built by aliens. But, that can't possibly be true. There is no proof that aliens exist in the first place, so how could a species that doesn't exist build a statue? Also, NASA released information saying that it was just a huge mesa forming into the shape of a face. The shadows just give it the illusion of eyes and a nose. Finally, the pictures of the ""face"" obviously show that it is not a built structure. It is just a natural landform on Mars. The pictures get clearer each time they were taken, so it is very apparent that the ""face"" is just a huge formation of rocks. So, all of this shows that there is no possible way that the ""face"" on Mars was built by aliens.

Although, I do understand why people could believe the ""face"" was built by aliens. It does look like it could be a monument, like the ancient Egyptians built for their people. However, life does not exist on Mars; therefore, the ""face"" could not be built by aliens. Also, some people think that aliens do exist on mars, and that NASA is just hiding it. But, why would NASA hide that they found an alien civilization? That could only help the company, not hurt them. And, if you still don't believe me, if there were aliens on Mars, wouldn't we be able to or have seen them by now? Once again, I say that the ""face"" on Mars is just a mesa that gives the illusion of a face, not a statue built by creatures that don't exist.

In conclusion, the ""face"" on Mars is just a natural landform, not something that was created by aliens. In the future, we might find out for certain what that ""face"" is. We aren't one hundred percent positive it is a mesa, but we know it wasn't aliens. I will be thrilled to find out what it is soon, and I think you will be, too.",4,1,0.8930573463439941

Its called the face because it appears to have eyes, mouth, and nose facial features. When word of this spread, it seemed to be very popular. After doing some research on the face on mars, it was confirmed as nothing but land forms. Not everyone believed that it was just a landform, people and scientist did believe that it was an alien artifact.

I say its not an alien artifact because in the photo in 2001 one has very little resemblance of a face or head. If you look hard enough you can see the rigid parts of these landforms. Im not saying that there's no such thing as life on other planets, but after revealing that it's nothing but a natural form of land on from the planet, it can't be an alien artifact of some kind. Many other planets may have features such as this.

fe069d3,"Do you believe in aliens? There are many on Earth that do. During a time frame from 1976 to 2001, everyone was talking about ' The Face '. A landmark on Mars that some believed aliens made it, some believe it is naturally made. I believe that it was naturally made. The reasons why are, NASA would benefit from it being aliens, without the shadowing it does not look like a face anymore, and lastly when the photo was released in 1998, all that was seen was a natural landfrom.

NASA higly benefitted from just the revealation of The Face. As quoted from the article "" The ' Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--even haunted grocery stroe checkout lines for 25 years."" These were all examples of how The Face became known with or without internet. These were all benefits for NASA

and helped it gain fame and sponsors. If there were comfirmed aliens that had built this structure NASA's profits would skyrocket, and they most liekly would have taken up that chance.

Another reason that proves it as a landmark is the fact that witout shadows it does not look like a face. If we take a look at the picture taken in 2001 we can see The Face without shadwing. Only if you look close at the where the human features would be, would you be able to see a face. As quoted from the passage "" ... when it spotted something with the shadowy likeness of a human face..."" "" ....' formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.' "" This shows that the 'face' can only be seen with shadows.

Lastly, when looked at in 1998, all that could be seen of The Face was a natural landform. By far the best evidence towards my claim, when taken all that was seen was a landfrom. As quoted from the article ""And so on April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time, MIchael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

The proof for this is NASA would benefit greatly from it being aliens, without the illusion of the shadows it does not look like a face, and lastly as seen in 1998 all that was seen was a natural landform and nothing else.

Aliens could not have made this because they do not exist, it would take a long time to make anything that scale, and it would take them years to make.

Aliens could not have made the face becasue they do not exist. This is why NASA thinks this. Aliens would have to have good construction and excavtion equipment. As you would say, they don't need that stuff they just built it. However, there is no physicaly possible way that they could have made it without the equipment. In order to build they would need this equipment. All together aliens could not have made this because they are not capable and do not exist.

Aliens could not have made the face because it would take a long time to make anything that scale. Here is why they could not have done it. They don't have the capablities to make anything like the face on Mars. The people that think otherwise would say that it isn't a natural land form. However, NASA scientist where comparing it to other natural landforms. That is why NASA thinks that it is impossible for the aliens to make anything to that scale.

Aliens could not have made the face becasue it would take to long. Here is why NASA is proving facts. This is not possible in any shape, way, or form because it would take over 300 years to do so. You would say that the aliens just bulit it as we bulid buliding today. But, they would have to have constrcution workers working every single day for this to happen and that is why NASA says it is impossible. Together that is why I do not think is is possible.

In conclusion, aliens do not exist, do not have cababilatlies to make anything to that scale, and it would take to long that is why aliens could not have made this face.

fe133db,"Hi, my name is Decaon. And I work for NASA. I am here to discuss the face on mars. Many people think that it was created by aliens. But I am here to explain why it wasn't created by aliens.

The first photo was taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 Spacecraft. The craft was circleing Mars trying to find a spot for its sister ship to land. The Viking 2 Spacecraft. The first reason to why people think it is alien. Is the quality of the pictures that were taken. The first picture was taken in 1976 so the resolution of the picture wasnt very good. Which caused it to look like there was a nose, eyes and a mouth. But pictures that were taken years after show that it could have been the quality.

There is another reasonable explanation. During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow. But many still believe that it is alien. Even though this some of the best evidence to peove the face on mars isnt alien but a mistake.

But the most compelling reason is. It is simialr to some of the rock formations that we have on Earth. Scientist have found that in the western United States there are rock formations that are very similar. They are simailasr to the snake river palin in Idaho.

After a lengthy expalnation. I hoope i have provided enough facts to prove to you that. The face on Mars was not created by aliens. but created by an optical illusion. That are found on Earth as well as On Mars. And i hope This has been very informative for you.",3,1,0.8773545622825623

Scientists can prove that their claims are inaccurate. They can prove this because, there is landmarks like this in the Midwest of America. Scientists belive that it was just another Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia. The only difference was this one had unusual shadows which caused others to believe it was made by aliens.

Astronauts from NASA went back up again to get another picture. They had took a good picture. Although peoplethat believed it was made by aliens argued it was a cloudy picture. NASA sent another mission up into space to prove them wrong once again. They took a picture on a clear day and still found no proof that it was alien made. This time they used a better camera so people who believed could not say it was because of the picture this time.

In conclusion you can't prove that it was alien made. Scientists have proven again and again that aliens did not make the Mesa. It may look as if someone, or something has made it but that did not happen. It is just an odd shaped Mesa like the ones in the Midwest. ",3,1,0.8383358120918274

The spacecraft had taken pictures of this landform and show the world a few days later in order to attract people to Mars. Some people, like conspiracy theorists, say that it's evidence of alien life that NASA has hidden from the public, but if this had been something NASA was hiding, they wouldn't have show that photo at all to the public. Scientists and astronaunts have denied this by adding titles that suggest otherwise on there photos, showing the photo in the first place, and going back up to space to take more pictures.

According to paragraphs 1 though 5, NASA had found a landforn that resembled a human face of an Egyptian Pharaoh located on a region called Cydonia. Mission control was surprised to see the face, but believed it was just another Martian mesa with unusual shadows, so they decided to reveal the pictures to the media, knowing there wasn't anything ""top secret"" or alien like about it. Then, according to paragraph 5, NASA had captioned the image, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,"" basically telling the public that it was just a quirky looking natural landform, not a big alien conspiracy theory. People defending the NASA budget even claimed they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, basically meaning there wasn't life that they knew of. Finally, in paragraph 7, another NASA spacecraft went over Cydonia on APril 5, 1998 and took better, sharper pictures, showing that it was just a natural landform that didn't have a civilization in it.

In conlusion, NASA was not trying to hide a whole big alien civilization theory from the world. They had just saw a cool natural landform with weird shadows that made it look like a human face and decided to share it with the world. If there was a conspiracy, NASA wouldn't have showed the picture to the world, added a title stating that it was an artifact, or have willingly went back up to space to take another picture of the landform.

If there were any aliens we would have seen them due to the fact that we have spacecrafts taking pictures of it and we have been on the planet ourselves. If aliens did make it why are we just noticing it why didnt we notice it the other times. or better than that why havent we seen any aliens working on it. If aliens did do it why is that the only thing they made why havent they made other things why just a face? We all know that aliens dosent exsist so stop saying that until we have evidence that aliens exsist. ",2,1,0.7123702764511108
fe546d8,"The ""Unmasking of the Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. Just like most natural landforms the face is quite bigger than seen on pictures.. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte. The picture also shows something equivalent to a mesa. The Face seen on Mars is a natural landform because it looks similar to a butte, it looks similar to a mesa, and just like most natural landforms its quite big.

The Face of Mars looks quite similar to a butte. First of all, a butte is a landform more common around the American West. In the text someone sates,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. Second of all, the Face is more simialr to a butte is becasue people could identify that they have seen something simialr to the Face. For example, in the text someone said that it looks similar to something that they have seen before. Lastly, the Face of Mars is just a landform that looks similar to some theat we have on Earth. A butte is more common on the west side of the U.S.

The Face of Mars looks similar to a mesa. First of all, a mesa is a landform which is more common around the American West. In the text someone states,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Second of all, the Face couldn't have been created by aliens becasue people right away could identify the Face as something they have sen before. Lastly, Mars's ""face"" is just a landform the looks similar to a lava dome that most people are familiar with. For example, lava domes that take the form of an isolated mesa is what the Face can be identified as.

Just like any natural landform, most of them are quite big. First of all, the photo of the Face captured took up most of the frame, most natural landforms are not quite hard to miss. In the text is states,As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! Second of all, ladforms aren't hard to miss. For example, in the text they explain that it was hard to take a picture because of cloud coverage. Just becasue the clouds coverd it doesn't mean that the clouds will clear, and i'm sure you could have seen it just not all of it. Lastly, When the picture was taken they said that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of the 43 meters per pixel in the picture taken in 1976. Just becasue the meters per pixel is smaller doesn't indicatethat the landform is small. Seeing it on picture is way different then seeing it up close.

In conclusion, The Face of Mars is just an rdinary landform because it looks simialr to a butte, it looks simialr to a mesa, and most landforms are big and quite hard to miss. From reading this you now know that the Face of Mars is just a landform an not alian markings.",5,1,0.7532430291175842
fea6ee2,"When curcling around mars the aircraft had taken pictures with they had captured a face on mars. this got back to the people wich made them belive that there was some kind of alien or life form on Mars.When having more photos the scientist had noticed that the face came from clounds which had made it look like a face,but while taking more photos the face was actually rocks in mars.In the passage it states the face had came a pop icon, it was in 'Hollywood films', it was even in 'haunted grocery stores' the face was used for 25 years.The face was also used to attract attention to Mars and which it did.

After reviewing some more photos the monumit was not an alien artifact after all.The face looked like Egyptain pharaoh because of the shadows. On earth tit was common sighting in the American West,also over the years the face was starting to fade so sayin gif it was an alien artifact the face would have not disapear or start to fade away and they could oly see it when it was very sunny on Mars or when it was very cloudy.

To make sure they sent Mars Global Surveyor to take more photos and the photos came out ten times better so they could see the photo. Also there is a 'lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars', and revealing that there was mo alien momunment after all.     ",2,1,0.8100801706314087

These photos were on the JPL web site and revealing a natural lndform. Very few scientists believed in the Fsce on Mars was an alien artifact. Those scientists thought that because they didn't have a good picture so they could defind it.

The Face on Mars cordinates are 41 degrees north latitude. There are people who still don't belive this. It was cloudy outside blocking the Face aliens could have been hidding. To prove that it's true on anothe day that was vividly cloudless, in the summer Mars Global Surveyors went back to mars for a second look.''Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.'' The pixels spans of images came back 1.56 meters to the Viking photo 43 per pixel. Since then the pixles have been enlarged by 3 times their size.'' So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes in the ground [around] or Egyptains-style pyramids or eve smalll shacks, you could see what they were.

fed7163,"What would you do if you saw a picture of a human face on the ground of another planet? If you were like millions of Americans in the world in 1976 you would automatically assume the worse. That it was some type of communication from aliens or that it was a warning that aliens from Mars were going to come to Earth. In the end these people where wrong and started to commonly be reffered to as conspiracy theorists. The human faces of Mars are really just natural landforms and NASA has been proving that for years.

If you were one of the people told to discover the truth about the faces would you stay calm, or buckle under the pressure? Many people in NASA stayed calm and put together compelling evidence that the landforms were completely natural occurances. In paragraph two of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" it is said that ""Scietists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusualy shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" This shows that the landforms were common on the planet, this certain one just had unusual shadows. Nothing to be afraid about, right? For most people no, it wasn't, but some still weren't convinced and one thing to blame was Hollywood.

Have you ever seen the face on mars, maybe in a movie or on a magazine? If the answer to that quoestion is yes then you are like most people around that time. When the face was made public many people and buisnesses jumped on the idea of telling the world made up facts or lies about the face, that it wasn't a natural occurance or that it was a sign from aliens. In paragraph five of the article it says ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grovery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide..."" This proves that people jumped at the idea of going against NASA and telling the world that the Face was something to fear, instead of something to admire.

After another spacecraft was sent to take a picture people still weren't satisfied. In paragraph eight it talks about how the second aircraft that took a picture was stuck behind clouds and people thought the image taken may be distorted in some way. To please the people NASA sent another aircraft to Mars to take yet another picture, but it wasn't easy. In paragraph nine it says ""Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin... Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in a narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" This statement proves that NASA would do anything to prove the landform was a natural occurance and when the picture came in, the doubts stopped. In the last paragraph it is stated that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" This put to rest the crazy theories of alien communication and proved what the face really was, a naturally occuring landform no different than others of its kind.

When you first heard about the face did you believe NASA's explanation or the Hollywood version? If you did believe NASA good job, not many people did, but if you were one of the Hollywood believers that is okay. Hollywood manipulated the face to make it look like something it wasn't and people believed them. In paragraph five it says ""The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon."" This means that you were not alone. The theorists believed Hollywood in what they said about the face. They also thought that since NASA was sending so many aircrafts to get a picture of it, they were just trying to cover up the truth. This is what many people thought for years, but finally the truth came out.

Now the ""Face on Mars"" is still big in Hollywood, but more to the truthful side. Less and less people believe the conspiracy's thoughts and ideas about the face and started to believe the facts. For years people were in the dark about what the face really was and when it came out people still denied it, but slowly began to warm up to the idea, that the face was a landform, much like the ones here one Earth and maybe people will remember this the next time we find something phenominal on another planet.",5,1,0.8354507088661194
fede8f3,"What do you think about the Face Of Mars? I think that Mars was made like that it is rocky and collected all the rocks and it made the face.You should really check it out because some things are ment to be probaly like the face of Mars.Mars is made out of rocks and know one has been there so it could've a been an human. The ancheints had'nt even had that type of technology so it wasnt them. There arent any sign of aliens so it wasnt them.Who could it been know one it was made like you need to belive in me because if we hadnt touch it yet know one has.

Mars was built with a face and i think it was made like that.hen all the dirt and rocks collided together it was collected all together and made cluster of dirt and rocks to make a face.If people lived on mars we would've got a message or more clues that they were there.Mars landform was built like that and just made that face.Is that a clue? I dont really think so becaue more and more clues to tell us they were there.If there were people on mars think about it how would they breath.

It takes a long way to get to mars long ago they didnt have electricity.If people long ago went to mars how would they build that face and make it that tall without any tools.If NASA look at Mars everyday and dont see any life signs how and who would make the face. I really think that mars has had a transformation then the face had appered.

If the something like that happened on earth then you should know that its just a natural landform.If aliens had made it then were are they at now.We would have saw a ufo flying in the sky.I mean I dont know why people believe that aliens mad that face if they dont have any back up or any proof.Then look at the picture who would put holes in a human girls hair.Now look at the thing across that a land formation there no way someone was really there playing with dirt and rocks.

Even though it look like somebody made it really its just art. Its a land formation and just a cluster of rocks with holes on the face.The face on Mars is a beutiful thing and it was just fantastic.But its just a natural landform that why it has all types of holes next to it and everything.Mars is so far away and there no way back so

who made the face know one.",3,1,0.8316911458969116
fef2540,"Somethings are difficult to explain because you can never be sure. There scientific explanations for different things already, but some are harder to explain. There is a picture that was taken by NASA's spacecraft Viking 1 that shows a shadowy likeness of a human face on the Red Planet known as Mars. There has been many discussions to what it could be some believe it was created by alien life and others think it's a natural landform. There has been different date collected to supported these claims. I'm a scientist at NASA that has been researching this topic and I believe it's a natural landform.

When people don't have an explanation for something they beginning to make things up. When it came this picture they asumed aliens. Since it's on Mars it's difficult to think otherwise. Also many things like the internet and magazines wanted publicity, so they changed the story to be more interesting and give the people what they wanted. I can see why they would think that because there really wasn't much to explain what it really was.

The Face on Mars was something people couldn't explain right a way before being sure what it was. Since it was in Space things like meteroids could have been a part of forming the Face. People tend to make conclusions to quick and not think it through very well.

The ""Face on Mars"" was talked about alot and it's quite breathtaking. The picture they captured of a ""face"" is just a natural landform. When people sat in the Jet Propulsion Lab and they saw the image, it was just formed by shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. It was natural formed. Over the years many things have occured that have changed many things that occur in the world around us. Technology is so advanced that we are able to send satelites up into space to help us and to see what else is out there. They send spacecrafts and rovers up into space on Mars and on the Moon. It's just another Matian mesa common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia and saw more clear pictures of the ""Face on Mars"" they saw and it showed no alien monumentment. There were no signs that it could have been created by aliens. In the year 2001 they captured an even better picture that allowed them to fully see the Face and collected more data on it. What the picture actually showed was the Martian equivalent of a landform common around the American West. Scientist at NASA say it looks similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. That proved once agian that it's a natural landform. There could many explanations to what formed it.

There is always going to be thing we can't explain or control, but with new technology and advancements in our world more of those unexplainable things won't be. We are the new generations and we can accomplish so much. We are always going to be discovering new things and have new things to explain. There is so much more beyond this plantet and all the other ones. Things out in outerspace may remane a mystery for quite some time, but not forever. We are close to making a breakthrough.

ff08987,"This unique landmark that appears on mars, also known as the Face, has been around for much of time. The birth of it's popularity began in 1976 when NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft snapped a photo of it. Many belive this is a form of aliens being on the planet Mars, many believe it is just a landform.

The Face that appears on Mars is just a natural landform because it is not logical for there to be an alien landmark such as this, the Face has faded overtime, and there was no sign of any objects near, around, or on it.

Overtime there has been many reports of alien spottings. The question is are they real? Over decades people claim to have encountered an alien but there has been no research claiming that they are 100% real, there has only been theories. Like these theories, The Face has just been one big theory as well. On paragraph 7 it clearly and bluntly states that the Face is just a landform, not an alien marking.

1976 was the first spotting of the Face, 2001 was the last picture of it. Overtime you can see in these pictures that it has faded away. The only time the Face appeared to look like a face was in 1976. In 1998 the face had seemed to blow over, plainly just smoothing out. In 2001 the face was purley just gone. Landforms change rapidly over time, whether it's on Earth or on Mars. So if it was an alien marking, why would the face have vanished? It would have stayed.

If this was an alien marking there would be some evidence that the aliens have made it. On paragraph 11 NASA researcher by the name of Garvin stated that him and members of NASA used the most high quality best cameras that could pick up quality the size of a rule of a thumb to see the Face. Garvin stated that there was no sign of objects near or on it, and on paragraph 12 he simply stated that it was a butte or a mesa.

of possible landing sits. You would think if the face was ctreated by aliens there would be something around it to prove it was made by them.

According to the article, Mars is just a naturally occuring thing, that was created by a nartural landfrom, not by aliens. For a while, many scientists believed that the face on Mars was actually an alien artifact, but, on April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Mailin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture, ten times better than the original Viking photos. Tons and tons of anxious wb searchers were waiting for the first image to appear on a JPL wedsite, although it finally revealed what was known as a natural landform (land formed by natural causes and natural ways) unfortunatly, there was no alien monument after all this time. Even after finding out it was just a natural landform, astronauts still didnt give up on looking for more artifacts, so on April 8th 2001, on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars's Global Surveyor drew in close enough for a second look,

American

West.

Snake

River Plain of Idaho,"" said Garvin. ""That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of Mars.""

ff4bc0c,"Mesa's form all of the time and they are a natural occurance and they should not be considered differently just because the land formation looks like a face. Mesa's form due to rocks that pile up nad form when erotion occurs from wind and other nutrients and minerals brush over the rock and the wind loose minerals that cause the Mesa to look like a face.

Nutrients and minerals loosen and crack over time as strong winds blow over formations and look like they are faces, trees, and other land for mations femaninans. the scientists have proven this over the years adn even done tests and studies on certian erotion types. some differnt erosion types are wind, oceans, rain, and other natural causes that over the years have caused thing to fade away mineral by mineral or brick by brick.

As you can see through the pictures as the years go on the cameras used by the space ships adn space things have evolved like erition only differnce is that erosion is bad sometimes, technological advances have occured througout the years and this is even another sign of erotion. Some of the tiem advancements can be abad thing becasue natural resources are lost by advaces and erotion. Stomachs can erode thing by the acids in them. they eat away at the food inside and can be fast or it can be slow.

The ""face"" on the planet mars is considered a face because it looks like one. Humans can look like animals but they arn't, technically. The ""face"" is there becasu eof the mineral build up and the rocksa dn dust that have collected there becasue of the strong winds and the mild winds and just winds in gernal. as the mineral build up grew and the winds picked up the minerals and dust blew away and then went somewhe else.

So this particular arguement is going to be ended by me saying that I am right your wrong and your going to go look all of this up and find out theat erotion and minerals are all natural and then you will come back adn thank me so you dont look odd when some asks you about the ""face"".",3,1,0.41906052827835083
