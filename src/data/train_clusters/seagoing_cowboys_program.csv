0033bf4,"What is the Seagoing Cowboys progam?

It was to help many countries that had been scarred by World War II.

These people helped with cattle and other animals that were shipped to Europe to help them.

People were asked to help by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, or UNRRA.

People should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam because, you get to help other countries and people, you get to see many parts of the world, and you have fun.

If you are in the Seagoing Cowboys progam, you can help other countries by giving them animals for food and work.

It makes you feel good about yourself.

The article says, "" It made me more aware other countries and their needs.""

That would make someone feel good about themselves for helping other countries.

Wouldn't that make you feel good?

In the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can see many parts of the world depending on where you are going.

You could see Italy and other countries.

The article states, ""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

That would be very exciting.

How would you like to see a bunch of different countries while working?

You wouldn't have to pay for travel

While working for this program, you would also have fun.

The people aboard the ship would play games on the way back to get more animals.

The cowboys would also play baseball and other games in empty ship holds where the animals were on the way there. Also the article even states that they played games.

Even though you are working, you will still have fun.

So, if you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will have fun, you will feel good about yourself, and you will also get to tour and visit many different parts of the world.

Many people helped with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

They helped many countries in Europe.

The cowboys still got to do what they always did, help with animals.

0040e27,"There are many reasons why you should join seagoing cowboys program. You would be helping your country. You'd be traveling around the world. Last you'd have lots of fun over seas.

You'd be helping our country because when Luke was in seagoing cowboy program it was 1945 and world war 2 was happening in Europe and he had to those countries recover. Luke had to help the horses when the war was over to get people places and to work. If you were 18 or up you might be lucky and be drafted into the military service. The UNRRA would hire seagoing Cowboys to feed the horses cows and mules that were shipped overseas.

You'd be traveling around they world like Luke did. It took Luke 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast. You'd be traveling to China, Europe, Greece, and many more places. The only way you'd be good at this job is if you wouldn't get sea sick because if you are a seagoing cowboy told travel overseas a lot.

You'd have fun overseas if you don't get seasick. You'd have many adventures. You'd have many stories to tell your friends and family. You'd been in countries you'd didn't think you'd be in. You'd be able to play games in the countries you visit in the seagoing Cowboys program.

If you join the seagoing Cowboys program you'd love it. You'd be traveling. You'd be having fun. You'd be helping our country. So why don't you join our seagoing cowboy program. I bet you'd love to be in this program with all our helpful friends and family that want to try to help our country. ",3,6,0.8886420726776123
006d0e1,"Have you ever seen Europe? What about China, or the Acropolis in Greece? Have you seen Venice, Italy, or the Panama Canal? If you've ever wanted to do those things, and help a lot of people while doing it, you're Seagoing Cowboy material. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of the hard work it teaches, the experience, and because you're supporting other countries, as well as your own!

First of all, we have the grueling hard work to speak of. Some may say that grueling hard work is not a reason to volunteer for something, but I disagree. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is nothing like a normal, boring life. Yes, you have hard work, but you get the greatest sense of satisfaction once you're done. You get to know that all your hard work has gone to helping people in need, and that you've really made a mark on this world. I think hard work is also the path to knowledge, and you may just learn some life lessons along the way.

Secondly, the fantastic experience is what we will cover. Some people may argue that the experience isn't worth risking your life over, but in reality, it's quite the contrary. If you're a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to travel the world, like I mentioned. You can see places like Greece, Italy, and China. Also, don't forget their unforgetable landmarks that you will see! Not only do you get to travel the world, but this is a once in a lifetime experience! We won't be around forever! Plus, I bet it will make one heck of a story to tell your grandchildren, am I right?

Finally, we have the service you are providing. Some may say you are better off in the military. This may be so, but would you rather be taking lives, or saving them? Plus, us Seagoing Cowboys were only created because of World War II to clean up the mess. Wouldn't it be counterproductive to start a World War III? Here, you get to help people, improve lives, and do good for your country, and the country you're in. I think that with more of us Seagoing Cowboys, we can make the world a better place.

Us Seagoing Cowboys know how to work hard, experienced a once in a lifetime chance, and supported our and many other countries. We've seen Europe, China, Greece, Italy, and even Panama! We've traveled the world, crossing oceans to and fro, for the good of mankind. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up today!",4,6,0.7648654580116272
008341a,"A Seagoing Cowboy is someone who helped take animals to the countries that were devestated by World War ll.

I, Luke Bomberger, am a Seagoing Cowboy.

I not only got to help others who were in need, but I also got to expirience the sights and hisoric landmarks in other countries.

I highly encourage you to join the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Think of how sad you would be if you were devestated by the war and had barely anything left.

Wouldn't you want someone to help bring you supplies such as animals?

Well you can be one of the few people to contibute.

The families over seas are all very kind and appriciative.

Though they are still very much in need.

So, you would just be helping the cause by joining.

Over the past year, me and my friend, Don Reist, have had the opportunity to see historical landmarks.

The chance to just see Europe and China would have been special.

But Don and I got to expirience so much more than that.

We got to see the Acropolis in Greece.

Also, taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, was a treat.

I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Come on.

Don't tell me you wouldn't love to have the opportunity to see the Panama Canal!

All you have to do is join the Seagoing Cowboys.

As you can clearly tell, being a Seagoing Cowboy is truly a great expirience.

We get to help those in need, and also have the chance to see historic landmarks around the world.

I hope that soon, you will decide to be like Don and I and join the UNRRA and become a Seagoing Cowboy.",3,6,0.8658130168914795
00a6693,"Do you ever have a yearning to have an experience where you help people, and see new places? I had one of those eye-opening trips myself when I took part in being a Seagoing Cowboy. All citizens should participate in this program. In this essay, I will explain why this program should include you in the next trip overseas.

When having deep affection for men and women who have served in wars such as World War Two, you long to give help back to them in repayment. That is why it feels so amazing to sail overseas with vital needs for discouraged people, such as animals or food. I have served for nine trips(the longest contributed by any Seagoing Cowboy), because it gives yourself satisfaction to keep youself busy with activities that lift people's spirits. If you join this program, you can feel like a warrior in different ways.

On these trips overseas, you can also live through rewarding and beautiful sites. With our free time in other countries, we had the opprotunities to see the Acropolis in Greece, and parts of China. We also got to experience what a gondola ride in Italy felt like through streets of water. Visualizing these historic places really make you want to see more of the world, and keep helping our world's health.

People opposed to the UNRRA may have many doubts why you would risk the danger and time. It is true that you sail where destructive and gruesome battles have taken place, but you can visualize the importance of why you need to help those citizens who have lost so much. Even though some may also state that it is too much scrificed time away from home, the time goes by fast while playing fun and relaxing games such as:fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and tennis tournaments. There are many reasons why you can make up for risks and sacrifices on this trip to pass time or feel more connected to your service.

Becuase of the ways this trip is so benificial to participants, it is a great program to take part in. Seeing beautiful sites and repaying soldiers help you analyze so much more about other places and war. For many people, it concludes as an opprotunity of a lifetime, that will never be forgotten. For these reasons, all citizens should participate in the UNRRA program overseas.",4,6,0.8043628931045532
01247bc,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy let Luke see all over the world and help people in need. He had the most fun on his home with the other Seagoing Cowboys. They would play Base baseball and volleyball in the empty hold of the animals been housed. They would aslo play table-tennis touranments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. When he turned 18 he wsa his way to Greece (as a Seagoing Cowboy) and he got draft. When they found out he was a Seagoing Cowboy they said he could do his service as a Seagoing Cowboy.

It opend up the world to him. He got to see the Acropolis in Greece and he rode up in Venic, Italy were the streets are water. Helping out on his Aunt's farm helped him for the hard work as a Seagoign Cowboy but it didn't help for the danger of the sea. It made him more awar of peole in other countries that need help and that stayed with him for life and he shared that wiht his family. He always said it was more than just an adventure.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun at times but can be realy hard at some parts. It helps for life like school does. I think that more peole sould get a try to become a Seagoing Cowboy just to learn soem of the same thing Luck did or see the things he might have seen. So give it a try it can be fun!

Its for SEagoing Cowboys that are willing to take care of horses, youngcows, and mules that are shipped overseas.

When you go through the proccess of going on the trip, don't get nervous. Luke Bomberger was a confident man to go on his journey with his best friend and was never really afraid. Every time you ride on that boat you feel more a live, which is a good thing. All you have to do is believe in yourself and you can do anything!

I know all the men loved to go on that trip to take care of many farm animals, especially if you do that your everyday life.

On his first (1st) trip the crew he was with ended up with 335 horses on the cargo, and had enough to feed everyone including the men on the ship.

The story of Luke Bomberger is probably not urging you yet, but when Luke was official 18 he knew that he could join military. Then he thought I still love seagoing trips, so I'm going to stick with it so he did. Do you see how motivated Luke was to join the Club of UNRRA. Luke already taken a total of nine(9) trips and he was proud of it. Luke couldnt imagine his life without the trips he wouldn't have gone on so he stayed on going with it and he was confident in his choice.

Not just that but Luke got to visit other countries such as China and European countries, such as Venice, Italy. He also got to help people all over the world. He was so proud of what he did and so full of joy. Luke oncer got hurt on one (1) of his journeys. While Luke was checking on the anoimals on a very rainy night he slipped and fell but luckly there was a small piece of metal that protected Luke from flying off the deck into the Atlantic Ocean, but thanks to that small piece of metal he was saved.

So ask yourself do you want to join the UNRRA club(united Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration). If you do make sure on your descions that you want to do it. Anything is possible for anyone! If it was possible for Luke Bomberger than its possible for you! So sign up now if you want to be a success like Luke Bomberger!

I got to see Europe and China. My friend and I got to help a lot of people during our time, too. There is also time to play around on the boats after you unload all the animals. I loved to play volleyball and baseball. Also, we played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

The program helped open up my eyes. It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. It might be a little hard at first ,and rough, but you'll get the hang of it. After all that, just think of how good you'll feel after knowing you've helped people. Signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys is a great opportunity for you.

022b620,"Luke was going to China, because his friend asked him and he said he couldn't pass this up. In the text it says that Luke had no idea that his life would change once he graduated high school. He was working two part time jobs. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. the United Nations Relief and rehabiliation Administartion hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and the Mule that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don helped and signed up for it. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. When he finally got there he helped on his Aunt Katie's farm. He went on a second trip. The cowboys all got along and began playing table tennis tournaments, baseball,volleyball games, and boxing and the games helped pass some time for the cowboys. The cowboy, also known as Luke Bomberger, lead his family to host a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many years. They arrivred in China August 14, the day the Pacific war ended. I bet his family was very proud of him. When he turned 18 I bet he was excited because he could be drafted for miltary service. Then when his board learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to just keep doing that for service.

The reason you should join the Military is because you could save a life. Several of lives. Also because we probably need more people because we could always use more people to protect us. Luke made nine trips after 1947.    ",2,6,0.6571815609931946
022d72e,"Have you ever wanted to become a hero? Have you wanted to help people through tough times? Well I know the job just for you! A Seagoing Cowboy. My name is Luke and I was a seagoing cowboy. One day my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I knew I couldn't resist the opportunity. It was 1945 and World War II was all over Europe leaving cities in ruins. Luckily, many nations came together to help support Europe. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were being shipped overseas. My friend and I both signed up.

We joined the group because we knew it would be an experience of a lifetime. We also wanted to help people and animals in need. It felt so good to be able to be called a hero. You also get to see many countries and their landmarks. They give you freetime to go and explore the city or town. You learn so much from the cultures and the different people who live there. Although it takes a lot of time, it is definitly worth the trip. You are so proud of yourself for helping people and animals. There is a lot of work involved and you have to be willing to do it. In the end though, it pays off.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy opened up a whole new world for me. It was definitly an adventure that I will never forget. It made me more aware of people and their needs. My family hosted a number of people from all over the world. It brought a new light into our eyes. We now know that not all people have what we have. We learned that we need to stay humble no matter how much we have. So go ahead, see what new adventure is waiting for you as a Seagoing Cowboy.      ",3,6,0.8228119611740112
0237cbd,"I think people should join the program that way they or we can help people or other countries in need of help. If other countries need help or something like water or food or something like that like maybe more homes to build for the homeless.

Another good thing about it is that you can travel around the world and the states like if there are more animals do in need because they are in danger and almost extinct!

The best part is that you go out around the world and help out everything and if you are in the news for that and the people see that you were on the news with all of you friends then they might as well congratulat you.

Once they see that people can do that to world then they might want to join because they to. When you around the world that means you might go to Asia and a lot of places that were very good in need like China,Japan,Mexico,Australia, and the best for helping out animals is probably Antartica.

People might say wow that bad because it's really cold there and that Therese really nothing we can do there but there is. You can help the endanger Penguins and sea lions that are there and bring more food for them and ever since the globe warming went up Antartica is slowly melting but then getting more snow but the heat are killing penguins. Maybe go to the polar and save some Narwhals or some other animals like polar bears.

So go around the world helping Elaphants,Penguns and also rhinos or just a lot of animals and other counterinsurgency that are helping animals and build more thing for them like China and the pandas and make more cities or homes for the homeless.

And plus maybe going around in the snow helping animals in the Polar or Antartica Isent so bad and helping out others with water and food and re building things for countries and that means you are doing something good for the world to.

026355a,"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you may get to see new sights. You may also play fun and exiting games while your off shift or while going on the return trips. You can also help out with fun things like feeding the animals or be put on night shift.

The sights you get to see could be amazing. The thing you get to see could be amazing. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see all types of new things like new fish or new landscapes. Some off the landscapes you might not be used to, but that means that you could enjoys the veiw! As your out on the sea you can see fish that you might of never seen before. You could also see reefs that are colorful and bright!

When your on the ship it could get quite borning. You might want to do something fun. Well on the return trip you get to play all the games etc. you want. Some games for when your in the mood for somehting sporty you can play baseball and volleyball where their are empty holds where the animals were kept. You can also play table tennis, fencing, and boxing. After you played the sports you might be ready for a relaxing game such as board games or cards. If your not into those kinds of things then you can just read or whittle. There is always a fun option.

When there are tons of animals on the ship there is always work to be done. To help out you can feed the animals and/or clean their stalls. You could also pull up bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. When you feed the animals you have to feed and water them 2 or 3 times a day. To be extra helpful you could help clean. It may not be the funnest job, but it helps a lot. When we get to our destination there are tons of animals to load off the ship. You coild help unload them or if we are back at our returning place you could help load the animals and all the supplies into the ship.

Next reason is it's not fit for everyone such as not everyone would like to do this task. The last reason is you don't earn any money from Seagoing i know its a opportunity of a lifetime but think about it.

The places you can go such as Europe now thats kind of odd. Of why you you would go in a cattle boat fulled with people you dont know. I'm not saying I would turn down that opportunity but I would think about it for awhile. You dont know where you going to be next you may get a hint or something i wouldn't know but it would be scary if it where myself doing this.

When would you get home? I would always ask myself this quistion if it were me on a cattle boat going to Europe .

Also what was the main reason why I took this opportunity. Was the main reason because it was opportunity of a lifetime. Think it over and find 3 main reasons why you took this opportunity.

I understand why Luck did what he did. What im trying im trying to say here is why he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II. What I dont unnderstand is what was his main reason.

To finish up my dissagrement of why someone like me or even you shouldent do this is, did he even help anybody becaue in the promt it didn't tell wither or not if he did. I would think that was that was the most important thing.            ",2,6,0.6652954816818237

During your daring trips around the world you visit places like Europe and China or any where else. You may incounter many people living in that area and experience the culture and foods. Just like when luke marveled at the Panama Canal. There are many famous places around the world and you could see many of them that not a lot of people see in their life time.

Many people across the world need a lot of help due to disasters that has happened to theemor in their country. Also the animals and not just the humans need our help because they are important creatures to this world.

And when out in some country helping you could have to take care of many types of animals that live there, and that you may have never seen before.

And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.""

'It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover thier food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).' As stated in paragraph 2.

'UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.' As stated in paragraph 2. Luke had made nine trips in two years of ""service.""

So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured am excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China

You have to be prepared for long, rocking, swaying trips. If just reading those words made you sick then I suggest you don't go. 'It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.' Luke had slipped down a ladder and broke a couple ribs, so, he could not do very much heavy work.

'Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and gmaes also helped pass the time.'

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun! It sounds like if I were one I would be pretty amazed and entertained. It opens up the world to you.

I got to see the Acropolis in Greece! They were made to honor the Greek gods and are on a big hill, above the whole city. It was wonderful. Although, the gongola ride in Venice, Italy was probably my favorite. It was like a mini cruise in the city streets!

I loved helping out with the animals on the ship. The slippery ladder scared me, but it was totally worth it. Don't break your ribs on the way down like I did. Ouch.

We got to play sports on our free time, which made it even better. There were many things to choose from, such as: baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. We also read, which helped us pass time.

You dont get this anywere else. You can go expeirience things all over the world. Eat exotic foods. You can go to exploring all over the Earth, and learn about the places you go. Just like Luke from passage five. He went to China and Europe.

You are going to learn so much. You could rome around excavated castles like Luke in passage five. You would learn about other countries. Their goverment, economy, and lifestyle. Their past,present, and future. Could you imagine how fun that would be? Can you imagine all the good you would be for your country?

Unlike those people who sit at home doing nothing you could help out your country. Luke did this instead of going to battle. He states it in paragraph four,""When my draft board learned I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service."" Not only are you helping your country but your also helping citizens of other countries all over the world. Which would make people look up to you. You would be a great American citizen.

03630c7,"Have you ever heard of the Seagoing Cowboys program?

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a thing alot of people should do. We help out with alot of stuff such as animals, and problems that where hard to solve after World War 2. You could also see amazing sights. I'm going to tell you all about the Seagoing Cowboys program.

In 1945 we had to help with horses in New Orleans. We had to make sure they had enough hay and oats to be fed with. Although there was 335 horses to feed we still helped out. For instance we crossed the alantic ocean for 2 weeks, just to get to China to help out. First,We fed them, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower parts of the ship. Then all the stalls had to be cleaned.

If you joined this program you would get to see amazing sights. Its a once in a lifetime chance to travel to China, Europe, Venice,and Italy. I got to explore the castel in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There is so many sights to be marveled at or explored. You should try this out.

There is so much more than helping animals and seeing amazing monuments and sights. You would also get to help people. There are lots of people out there who dont have much food or any shelter. World War 2 is the cause of this harm to people. First of all, helping people could give you a good reputation. Secondly, its nice to help people who are poor and don't have shelter or food. Lastly, I think it is a good thing to do for those people.

People fought in World War 2 and now its your turn to step up and lend a helping hand. This program is possibly the most helpfullest program in the U.S.A.                    ",3,6,0.7960157990455627
036e19b,"A argument Luke is dealing with from his point of view is how much things he has to do and if he does the commands wrong there will be horrible consequences for them.

When Luke heard about the job he was so excited about it. He heard that being a Seagoing Cowboy was a amazing job. He has been dreaming about being a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the animals you take care of and all the traveling they do. That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke worked very hard and sometimes got tired. He went to alot of places. He went to New Orleans and Greece and other places. As soon as he was done with all the traveling he made nine trips all together! He made more trips than any Seagoing Cowboy!

Later on Luke kept working with all the animals. All the taking care of made Luke very busy, beside with the traveling. Luke also had to clean.

On Lukes second trip he served his night as a watchman. He had to check on all the animals every hour. But then a horrible thing happened. After making his hourly report to the captain, Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. He landed feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metel along the edge stopped his slide, that kept him from going overboard into the dark Alantic Ocean. But luckly for him he was still alive.

As soon as that insedant happened to Luke, he got his ribs cracked. Luke couldn't work for a couple of days. So while Luke was not going to work he managed his time to have fun on board. He played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. He played alot more games aswell.

Later on being a Seagoing Cowboy he thought of how amazing it feels to help people. He helped lots of people during his trips. So Luke had a great idea. He wanted people to help other people. He started to convince people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But most of people thought he was crazy. He told people how amazing it is to be traveling and amazing it is to be helping others.

People called his job dangerouse. It sure was. Luke got very annoyed and angry because people thought he was crazy and they did not like that kind of job. Luke stopped persuading people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. But He didn't give up on his job though. He liked his job the way it is and he wouldn't change it for anything. He got awards for being a very helpful, admiring, and amazing person in his job.",2,6,0.7248492240905762
03c0382,"Luke Bomberger had his life changed for the better when he joined the Seagoing Cowboys. He had the pleasure of exploring the world and helping many nations in need. You could help the world too if you helped out the cowboys.

Luke shows that you have the chance to explore new places and meet new people when you are helping this cause. Luke got to travel all the way to China and he explored Venice, Italy. Luke also had the privelege of playing tournaments and various games on board of the cattle boat with his colleagues. You could make new friends and lend a helping hand with UNRAA.

One of the hardships of being a Seagoing Cowboy is having to take care of livestock. Luke provides information that it takes alot of hard work to maintain these animals. Some of the jobs that have to be done include cleaning pens, feeding the livestock, and getting them water. Even though this all seems like too much work, it still pays off with having the feeling of knowing you helped someone's life.

A final reason that you should join this program is that it shows hope that the world could be a better place for every nation. These people are helping provide food to citizens' lives who were affected by war. This shows a ray of sun shine to people who aren't lucky enough to have a home or food. It shows these people that they will be helped. If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you could make someone out there feel like this.

The cowboys out on the sea are helping lives become better out in the harsh world. They are providing food for the hungry, and they are making miserable lives great. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.",4,6,0.839202880859375

UNRAA hires Seagoing Cowboys to sail livestock to assist the population of the world in recovery. These are people who are more aware of people of other countires and their needs. The awareness stays with them. Here's why you should join.

First off, the adventure! You will sail across the world and visit many wonderful countries and their people in your quest to provide relief from a terrible disaster. It sounds like something right out of a storybook, doesn't it? Another reason is the sightseeing. You are provided with lots of freetime, so why not enjoy the beauty of both Mother Nature and mankind whilst you're on your journey. Maybe you'll get lucky and get to see the Panama Canal, or the temples of China. Also, wouldn't it be great to see the happy people and, most importantly, the children who you're going to help get back on their feet. Remember that warm, fuzzy feeling inside when you get doing something good? And if you like animals, and/or the ocean, you're going to want to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

In conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys are great, generous people traveling a world which needs saving, for a multitude of reasons. Wouldn't you want be a hero, and climb into the ranks of the noble? And remember, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so don't miss out on it.

03fb253,"Luke is a boy signing up with his friend Don,here's some reason's why you should also sign up like Luke did himself. My first reason is you can help people while you travel like how Luke did when he went to europe to help people restock on supplies,food,and animals. You can also go because,while you're shipping animals across seas you can spend time with somepretty amazing animals. Another good one is you can go sightseeing while shipping or going on the land you shipped something to like how Luke did when he went to Europe. These are all great in my point of view because even its some hard work it can still be enjoyable because there is just so much to see like how I mentioned the animals before,and of course the sightslike ruins,structures,and much more. Another point of fun you could have while being a seagoing cowboy is after you shp the animals off of the boat or ship when the animals are gone it can clear up some room for you and any friends you may or may not have made. What I mean is after the animals are gone you can use the extra room for games,messing around,and even spending time with friends you may have made. THis is a good idea because even thogh its hard work and a little bit dangerous Luke stayed positive because of him stating ""The cattle boat trps were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy"" meaning he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy. Now even though its still fun to be a seagoing cowboy there is still dangers. The ocean is a pretty dangerous place so it'll still be a hard job especially when it comes to storms. If a serious storm hits while on a boat trip it could still be pretty devastating someone could get knocked off and go into the ocean,one of the animals could fall off,and someone cold slide and break something when they have a hard fall. Even though its still pretty dangerous and pretty hard work for someone it can still be enjoyable Im not going to say the same stuff I already said earlier so Im just going to say that depending on how it goes and how you act about it it will be enjoyable just wait and see.",2,6,0.850705623626709
04a4c98,"Most people might get sea sick, But I tell anyone who will listen that it is worth it. Being a sea cowboy is an amazing exspereance. There are many reason to be one such as not be put in the war, sight seeing, and sports with other people on board. Also you get payed watch and feed animals which is not that bad.

When I was on the boat was saeled to Greece. By the I turned 18 which ment that I would be drafted. Sence I was a sea cowboy I was told to continue me work on board. This is only the lest exieting part of my jurny.

On my trip I saw many different monumaets and struckchers. For example the Acropolis in Greece. I also saw the parts of Italy and china. Seeing places like the Panama Canal is one plasure of being a sea cowboy, but what would I do on the waters.

On the waters I played games. Even with the boat rocking we played games like table-tennis tournaments. We also played other games such as fenceing, boxing, and baseball in some of the empty holds. If you are not a sports person the you could also read.

Over all being a sea cowboy is a great job with may plasures of game, sightseeing, and no war. Even though it might be hard and tiering work it is worth the try.             ",3,6,0.7935563325881958

It's every fun, it allowed me to go on adventures and vist unique places like Greece, Venice, Italy, and I even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are also others things to do besides go to different places when you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Even though you get free time there is also work to do. When my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat I just couldn't say no, I knew it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime. Let me give you some reason on why you should join.

Like i said before there are others things you have to do when participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One thing is you have to take care animals. Everytime I found it fun taking care of the animals, especially on when I returned from trips and the animals had been unloaded. There were different types of animals on board like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped oversea. Once there was even a cargo with 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

My next reason is you also get to play games on the ship. The cowboys and I played baseball, volleyball games, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. These games helped us pass time when we didnt have work to do. Sometimes we would even play games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We would even have different types of tournaments.

The most important and my last reason is that while in the Seagoing Cowboys we had to help different people with things. We had to help them with animals, food, and we had to help on the ship. There were many things we had to do on the ship like be watchmen, check the animals every hour, and make an hourly report to the captain. There is a lot of work you have to put in into being a Seagoing Cowboys even if you do get hurt. But it will be all worth it in the end.

I hope you decide to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It was very fun for me, so if i had fun being one then I feel like you will to. You will have a lot of fun trust me. ",3,6,0.8834930658340454

Luke did not know that when he grauated from high school it will become hard. He has to work two part time job to get money to buy his own stuff.

So one day his friend asked him to go to Europe with him he could not say no because it was a big opportunity of a lifetime.

In 1945 world war two was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover there food supplies animals and more 44 nations joined together to help these people get all the things they need and all they supplies they need to help the animals thats why Luke and Dan sign up to help the animals and peole to get better and get the stuff they need to survive.

Thats why Luke and this friend Dan wants you to be in the seagoing cowboy group beacuse wants you to learn how to help other and do somethink nice just to do it and just to give because giving is nice beacause some people in that country like i said dont have food supplies now if you help them get that they will have enough to feed kids themselfs and others that dont have food.

He one time failed down the stairs to check on the animals but he couldn't work becaues his rib was broken but he was doing fine. Luke was always do his work but he do a good job to finish his job on the cruise.

First of all, you can get some character by volunteering and helping out. So when you are a sea cowboy you have to do work all the time so you are busy so then if you have to you can learn how to clean, feed, and water animals on a farm.

Another thing is that you can help people and make someone happy. Don't you just love the joy you get when you help someone in need? Well you can have that feeling all the time if you volunteer because you are always helping people in need by giving them animals to eat.

For the record, you can see amazing monuments and other amazing things by just volunteering. You get to see these things for free because you have to go to some places like how I saw the Acropolis and I took a grondola ride so that was fun.

Something else is that you can get out of the drafts. I know because when I was on the ship, Iturned 18 and they said to keep going for my service and so that made me happy.

Finally, you get to have afun way back. I know because there is nothing to do so to pass the time. We played baseball and volleball games and even had a table tennis or ping pong tournament. We also played fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling games to pass the time.

So many people, that would have otherwise not have been able to do very well, got animals, food to feed their animals, and food for themselves. Helping them helped me to be more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all that serious though. We would play around on board, usually after all the animals had been unloaded, and we were heading back. We would have baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where the animals had been kept. Table-tennis, fencing, and boxing were other sports we found a way to play. There were also things like reading, whittling, and games we used to help pass the time.

Along with our jobs, sightseeing was something we did everyday. I got a side benifit of seeing Europe and China. In Greece, I got to do something I think is pretty special. See the Acropolis. In Venice, Italy, I got to take a gondola ride on one of the many streets of water. I also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and saw the Panama Canal on the way to China.

I was amused when he said that he he was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. This is why Luke wants to pass on the expierence.

Luke thinks people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is a once an a life time opportunity. Luke also likes the places he gets to go to such as China, and many other places like Greece. Like when it stated in the text ""The cattle boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy."" This is almost a life time of happy memories.

Helping others is a great thing to do and very inportant. There are lots of people without food or cloths to wear. People need help because their towns have been destroyed and they have nothing left for them. They also need animals to perduse meat, wool, and they can sell htem so they can get money to buy things. Lots of those people are dieing from hunger or they are out side with no place to sleep or even sit. They need our help,they need your help.

You might be think how am I going to get there. We will take you by boat but you might be wondering that seems boring and we will have nothing to do on the boat. There is lots of things to do on the boat. You can feed the animals as we take to different places. Does that seem boring to you if so you are right but there are othering things to do such as baseball and volleyball games and other games. On the back that is when you can really start having fun. SInce there are no animals on the boat that extra space can be use as a table-tennis room and you can have tournamets. You can also have fencing,boxing,reading, whittling.

06e25aa,"The reason we want you to be in our program is that..Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change vey soon, when Don Reist (Luke's friend) said that he was invited to go with him in Europe in a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no so, he went with him for an opportunity of a life time.

In 1945, World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. 44 nation joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitatiion Administration ). After that the UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young farm animals that were shipped overseas. When luke turned 18 years old right before he arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. In 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy was ever been through.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable opportunity for a smal- town boy, Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luke also found time to have fun on board, esspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played music, played games, sports they played, and also read to have some relaxation.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy for Luke was much more an adventure for him it also gaved him much more experience to the world than he imagined. It made Luke more aware of peole of other countries their needs. and that awareness stayed ith him, leading his family to host a number of international student and exchanged visitors for many years.

0719241,"I will be writing about why you should paticipate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will include details from the story. Also reasons to join the program. the last thing i will include is examples from the text.

My frist reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is just to experiance new things. You should not be on your phone all day doing nothing. Get up and at least try to have a little bit of fun. if you have never been there or even heard of it how do you know it is going to be boring. You never know until you drop your phone and actually join. You might end up having some fun.

A second reason is well look what Luke Bomberger did. He joined 44 nations to form unrra (the united nations relief and rehabilitation). UNRRA took care of horses, young cows, and mules that wers shipped overseas. Wouldnt you want to spend your days with nice and loving animal that wont hurt you. You never know, if no one joins Seagoing Cowboys then maybe there could have been animals who were in dangered, or might be extinct. I think that animal are really fun to hang out with.

The last and final reason is you dont just take care of animals but you help the places that were dastroyed because of world war II. It would be great if you actually got to see where many people were fighting, got killed, injured, or much more in world war II. Just like Luke in the story, you can also go to may places that he went like new orleans, or greece. This is your oppertunity to visit beautiful places that you have never been to before. You could also meet new people.

To summarize everything up those are some reasons why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. You just never know until you try it out.   ",3,6,0.8880957365036011

These are just some of my reasons to join now!

I also got to see alot of things on th trips I went on, nine to be exact. On a trip to China I got to see the great and Marvelous Panama canal!

A seagoing cowboy is someone who takes care of animals that are shipped over sea. Then brings them to the people that need help since the war ruined their food supply or cattle.

It is kinda hard to care for the animals but its not to much of a challenge. I used to help out on my aunts farm all the time and that gave me some experience. It also is a little disgusting to clean the stalls the first time but I pulled through it and eventually I got used to it. My favorite part has to be traveling when i get some free time its fun to go sight seeing.

As a seagoing cowboy you go all around the world and visit amazing places but there are sad moments aswell. When I found out that people other than me are being affected by the war and some are suffering worse, that opened up my eyes. I thought to myself thats why I joined the seagoing cowboys after all not just because I wanted to see the world but also to help people in need.

08a4217,"I don't know if you know know who I am but, I am Luke Bomberger. I have been on a ship for many years now. You should ride a cattle-boat too. A cattle-boat is a boat that carries animals across sea. When I was younger I helped my aunt Katie with her farm, that helped me prepare for the dangers that life holds.

Even though there are dangers at sea, I still like it. I am very happy while I am on this boat. It is an opportunity of a lifetime. ""I am grateful for the opportunity."" I said back in the 1900s. I was told by a captain to keep doing cattle-boating for my service. Your friends could help you become a cattle-boater. My friend helped me. By participating in cattle-boat, you could learn about other people and their needs. You could also learn about more cultures.

You may not think this a great ""job"" in all but actually, it kind of is. You do not know what is going to come at you. It's like a total suprise! You could be the driver of the boat, you could watch over the animals like me, you could do all sorts of things! We'll make sure you get fed. Who knows maybe you could even end up being the captain of the ship. That would be cool considering you just got here. You may think this is a joke but it's actually not.

There are a lot of men and women on this ship with the animals. You could be one of them, and who knows, maybe you'll try it and like it as much as me. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" When my friend asked me to go with him, I couldn't say no because I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Maybe you will have one of your friends come up to you an ask you to go to another country with them and away from your family. Maybe, you'll even say yes.

If you do go anywhere, tell me and I'll give you all the hints I know. Be careful though, the sea is dangerous. There have been a few ship-wrecks here and there. But not for a while. You are going to need a couple essentials: blankets, pillows, extra clothes, food, water, shoes and that is pretty much all you need for this boat ride. Have a good time! ",3,6,0.7242483496665955
08a4c92,"What if there was a program that helped countries around the world? There is and it's called the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is amazing and I know because I was in it. By the time I was 18, I made nine trips with the Seagoing Cowboys program. I'm Luke Bomberger and here are reasons why you should join this program.

The first reason why you should join this program is you can see lots of amazing sites. I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece, which I thought was special. In Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, I got to take a gondola ride. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Also, you should join because you get to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. That's how they started the Seagoing Cowboys so that they could take care of animals. When I went the first time, there was a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. If you like animals, there's one more reason to join.

Another reason you should join is because of what happened during World War 2. What happened during that war was that countries were left in ruins. I went and trust me, this really changes the way you think about other countries and the world.

This is my favorite reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys, the fun games during the trip. We used to always play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We would also have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. I have to say that they were awesome and helped time pass by.

The final reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it can open up your world like it did to me. I used to work at a bank and a grocery store and I never expeced this to happen to me. I'm grateful for the opportunity because it made me more aware of other peoples lives and what they and their country need to continue thier lives. Now, that awareness is still with me and I lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Take it from me, being a Seagoing Cowboy is awesome and helps you learn about the countries around the world. You can see and do cool things and make a difference in a persons life and a countries life. You should agree with the reasons why I said to join the Seagoing Cowboys because I went and joined and it changed my life. That's why you need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.",4,6,0.8177155256271362

08fb0fb,"I am Luke Bomberger and I just graduated from High school and had two part time jobs. One was at the bank and another at the grocery store. One day my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to go to Euroope on a cattle boat, and I could not resit it.

It was 1945 and World War two had just ended and the UNRRA joined together and helped the coutries to recover from the war. UNNRA hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the cattle that were shipped over seas. Don and I signed up to do this position. In August we got orders to go to New Orleans. I had 335 horses that I had to take care of.

After about two weeks we finally arrived, but caring for the animals kept me busy.

They had to be fed and watered at least two or three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be dragged from the lower holds of the ship and the stalls had to be cleaned out. I had helped out at my aunt? farm when I was younger but I was not prepared for the dangers on the sea. On my second trip I was going to go make my hourly report to the captain and I slid down a slippery ladder. A small metal strip had stopped me from going into the dark atlantic, but I was not able to work for a couple days because my ribs were cracked.

This job kept me very busy, and had many oppertunities to see things I have never seen before. I halso had found some times that I could have fun on board instead of having to care for the animals. After the animals would be dropped off we would head back. We played all kinds of activites and games. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball in empty places were the animals were. We also had table-tennis tournoments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, the games had help pass time.

I encourage ever teenager if you have an opputunity, to sign up for this job. This job I was able to see things I had never seen, it was a lifetime experience, and I was able to stay busy with the animals and then have a little fun. I encourage this job because this is what I did it was an enjoyable jod. I mean how cool is it to ride a ship and take care of cattle. Then after they get unloaded you can even have some fun on the ship. It helped me become more aware of other countries and their needs.   ",2,6,0.6174765825271606

So if join this program than you will have the time of your life and you will probly will do the same things Luke did. Luke did many things like playing games with his friend or explore a little because when Luke did this he injoyed this journy.

Here is some more reasons you might want to join the program. So Luke went on a journy with his friend and there was 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed the horses. Luke was going to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Lukes favriot thing was seeing the Acropolis in Greece. Luke also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Luke had a lot of work like clean the stables feed the horses two or three times a day. Luke also found time to have fun on borad, especiallyon the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. The world opened up for Luke.

So if you join this program you will have the time of your lives. You will get to visit diffrent places and see diffrent things like everything that Luke saw on his journy. You will get to play all types of diffrent games like every single game that Luke played with all the other cowboys. So if you join the world will open up to you like it opened up for Luke.

0912e51,"In a Cowboy who Rode the waves , the author talks about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only does this program help victims , but it can save many cities that would soon start a war. Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowboys would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that he just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, he got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that he did the same things on his Aunts farm, but did not help him at sea. One day a bad storm hit and he landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , he could not work for a few days because of his broken ribs. He was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. He had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job he helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . He helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all he had to have a little adventure , right?

In conclusion , Luke loved his job. It was as it was all an adventure. The text states that it opened a new world to him. After that he raised more awareness. All i know is that he will , Survive !",2,6,0.798060417175293

This oppurtuntiy is to become one of the UNRRA's Seagoing Cowboys. Seagoing Cowboys travel all over the world to to recover countries that were left in ruins from wars. You would travel on a ship with animals and other cowboys to help people who's life seems to be in ruins.

It might just change your life, like it changed mine.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you won't regret it. It was a whole lot of fun. I got to meet other cowboys and you never get bored. When I was on board ships, especially on the way back, we played games and had some pretty fun competitions. We used to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty space that used to house animals. We fenced, boxed, and held table-tennis tournaments. It was a lot of fun!

You get to help people; this is a big reason to join. You get to become part of an organization that helps people who need it, desperately. You could become their hero. Becoming part of something like this changes your whole life. It made me selfless and aware of the world around me. That awareness has been with me through my whole life. Although I'm no longer a Seagoing Cowboy, I'm still aware of what's happening to people around the world and how lucky I am. I let international students and exchange visitors into my house as an effort to help.

You get an amazing expereince along the way. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, see Europe and China, tour a castle in Crete, see the Acropolis in Greece, and even get a view at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I wouldn't have been able to have any of these experiences if it weren't for being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Now that you know all about the Seagoing Cowboys program and the benefits of being part of it, go sign up! You could be a person's hero. Mend the hearts of those who feel like they have nothing left. Feed those who hunger with no way to recieve food. Take the oppurtunity of a lifetime, and, maybe, it will change your whole life, like it changed mine.              ",4,6,0.8416082859039307
09487c8,"The reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because its an opportuntiy of a life time,as said by Luke. There isn't just one reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program there are thousands of reasons. The main things are the locations,the people, and the experiences.

To start my reasoning, you could help thousands of people. You could also have fun on your adventures sailing to all these different contries and states. As you grow you will learn more about what you are doing. You could get really cool things when your traveling too. You could even help take care of animals.

Secondly, you could do really cool things on board. You could get to watch animals, play baseball,volleyball,table-tennis touraments, fencing,boxing,reading,whitting,and games that could pass the time. All of those things Luke did on board. You can do all of those things in empty holds.

In addition, for Luke it was much more than an adventure. You have someone to look off of and to see a ture experienceof being a Seagoing Cowboy. Now you should see why Luke said it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In concusion,I see why its so great to be a Seagoing Cowboys. The places you travel to,the people who you travel with, and the adventures. Just think of all the fun you could have on that very special boat just wondering what lies on the other side of that island and what you could learn the points are endles. So join the Seagoing Cowboys and then you could get in for sure. How you will react when you take that first step onto the next part of your life

Some of the parts to make this possible are ,''Luke could't say no. He knew it was an opportiunity of a lifetime. Paragraph 7 tells you that he lives with his aunt Katie and paragraph 8 is where i got how many things he did while he was on board and why they thought theose activities were fun. The end about how it was more than just an adventure , I got that from paragaph 9. ",3,6,0.8927977681159973
0958685,"I , Luke Bomberger, am a memeber of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The Saegoing Cowboys help people who were affected by the war.

I believe everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for three reasons.

Not only do you get that warm fuzzy feeling from helping people out, but you also have a once in a lifetime chance to go sightseeing have the time of your life onboard, and explore the most beutiful and amazing places on Earth.

By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you get to help out the less fortunate explore go sightseeing and have fun.

We help people by bringing them animals from overseas such as horses, cows ,and mules.

When we bring the people the animals it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling of acomplishment.

You should also join because after our missions, we have some time left to go sightseeing in the area.

Some of my favorite things to see were the Panama Canal and ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

I also had the opportunity to expore much of Europe and China as well as taking a gondola ride in Italy. I also got to take a tour of a castle in Crete. If you think that the fun stops when you climb back aboard for the ride home, think again.

The stables where the animals were kept becomes a baseball field and a volley ball court.

We also have table tenis tournaments as well as boxing and fencing matches.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun as well as important.

In conclusion, ""the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.""

I reccomend becoming a Seagoing Cowboy because not only are you helping the world, but you get to have fun while you do it such as sightseeing and exploring.

I myself have gone on nine trips as a Seagoing Cowboy and loved every second of it.

It also opened up my eyes and ""made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""

So,unless you are doing something useful with your life, become a Seagoing Cowboy.

You won't regret it.

The reason I think people should participate in this program is because you get to go on vacations and you almost get to explore around the world. You also are crossing the Atlantic Ocean and also going to China. It also seems like a fun activity because in paragraph nine it says that Luke was grateful for the opportunity. In paragraph five it also says that he toured and excavated castle's while he was on his way to China. You had to do a little work to because its says in paragraph seven during the crossings it kept Luke busy and he had to check the animals every hour. I also believe it is alot of traveling because in the introduction it says that Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than 16 times. In paragraph nine it also talks about how he felt much more than just an adventure for Luke. In paragraph four its says that they knew he was a cattle-boat trip but they told him just to keep doing it for his service.

There is also many other different things to do if you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy and I think Luke really enjoyed it because in paragraph seven it says that Luke was happy to be alive. Also on Luke's second trip he served as a night watchman but he couldn't work for a couple of days because he cracked his ribs.

That is why I think people should patrticipate in the program because it sounds fun and enjoyable and you could also join with your friends. ",2,6,0.832671046257019

I think other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will give you some reasons to support my opion.

One reason is they are very caring, because World War II ended, and it is 1945 and many countries were messed up from the war. so 44 nations joined together to help it's called the UNRRA, the UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys. So they both were helping these countries. So that is a reason why you should join because they are caring. Another reason is they go across the world to help countries. So when you think about you can go on tours to some places across the world and go sight seeing, so that is pretty cool. Last reason is just doing the right thing it is a very caring and helpful program to help innocent people who were not in the war, that died and houses got damage. so it is a helpful thing to do and fun thing to join.

some details that support luke claims is in paragraph 5 it says that one of the boys in the smalltown said besides helping people he had time to see Europe and China so like luke said it's not only just helping people you have time to go on tours of places in some of these different countries that you never ever seen that place before and go on a tour of that place in that country. Another detail is in paragraph 8 it says that it is fun on board coming back because they played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments,and a few other games so joining will be fun because when you are on board or on the ship you can play games.

So that is all I have. I think people should really recommend participating in

Seagoing Cowboys program beacuse I think it is a wonderful program. I agree with Luke point of view you should convince others to participate in this program. It helps others and yourself. I would participate in this program if I could.",2,6,0.8549540042877197

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it gives you a lot of opportunities to see different places.

You can go visit some of the most exciting places in the world.

Also if you like animals it gives an opportunity to take care of them.

If you have never gone over seas then there is your opportunity. You travel all over the world, go over the seas, and oceans. You get to adventure the seas, oceans, and the world. Also if you are a young Seagoing Cowboy and you still need to attend school the you can learn about the countries and seas by exploring them.

Like I said earlier if you still need to attend school you can learn different languages because you are exploring the world. So by learning diffenrent languages it can open up many opportunities for you. But it doesn't need to be all about learning. You can play games on the way and see many different sites that's the whole world would want to see. Then when you come back you can tell all your friends about the trips you have had. Then maybe they would like to come along with us.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to take care of all the animals every day. In the text it states that the animals have to be fed and watered about two or three times a day.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy it opens your range of knowledge about the world, so you can learn so much about people's culteres and style, but if you don't like learning about the world there is a lot of time to socialize with your freinds or make new freinds. Luke Bomberger the longest person to be a Seagoing Cowboy at that time states ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbeliveable opportuninty for a small-town boy.""

Though being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun there still are struggles you have to get pass. Luke Bomberger on night watch went to go down to the captin about the hourly report (if you are the night watchman

you have to do a hourly report on the animals) and while he was going he sliped on a slipery ladder an went feet first to an edge of the ship where he could fall off into the dark icy alantic ocean, but luckily a strip of metal along the edge stoped his slide, but he broke his ribs and couldn't work for a few days.

So a lot of people would consider trying it out because of these resons. The UNNRRA is a group of 44 nations so you would work with people around the world if anyone joined. If someone joins it might be the most thrilling part of their adventure of life. When Luke was done he said ""I'm grateful for the opportunity.

They are fun to ride. You could see the Eifel tower. You could go to Europe. You want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because you could ride horses, go places you've never been before, and see things you've never seen before.

You should be a Seagoing Cowboy because you could ride the horses to the place they have to go. You would have fun riding them. Horses are fun to ride. You could even watch after the horses. They stay in their pen because they wouldnt try to runn away because you would be in the ocean.

You could go places you've never seen before. You could go to Venice, Italy and ride on the strees of water. You could go to Greece and bo whatever you want.

Imagine always being out in the seas where theirs beautiful scenery. Imagine actually looking foward to helping animals and hear the noises of the wind blowing you across the Atlantic Ocean on a boat. Well thats what Luke Bomberger had to look forward to everyday. Its called being a '""Seagoing Cowboy"". Here are some reasons why you should become a seagoing cowboy. First, Seagoing Cowboys take care of horses,cows, and mule that are shipped here. Second, caring for animal keeps you busy. Lastly, on free time cowboys play fun games like baseball.

Some people think that being a seagoing cowboy is boring but most people think its pretty cool. when you take care of horses, cows, and mule it actually teaches you some life lessons like what to exactly do with those exotic animals.

Caring for animals is time consuming it takes up a ton of your free time but its all worth every single bit of you're time to learn from it.

When cowboys play fun games its usually at times when the animals have been unloaded off the ship and when everything has been cleaned and ready for more animals.

From attending to every need of the animal and letting horses,cows,and mule fill your free time to. Later playing a game on the ship when you did all that work it really makes you hapy and ready for more challenges that life gives you. So sign up to become a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" today!                      ",3,6,0.8062919974327087

Being a seagoing cowboy is hard work, but if you are like me you will have had to do chores or work on a farm, doing these helps. For me it helped so much the work seemed easy! If you join us you can come on trips with me!

Yes, you might say it is hard and will get boring, but if you say that them you aren't even giving it a chance. Just because there are cattle you have to watch and you think you always have to watch them. You don't, you only check on them every hour. Even if you think it gets boring, think again. On our way to our destination we visit many places like Acropolis in Greece which was to me the most special place we visited. but we still visted other places like Europe, China and going on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. We even have lots of sports and other fun activities! We even have tournaments for table-tennis, also you can play baseball, volleyball, fencing, and boxing. If you don't like sports you whittle or read. Now as you can see no time goes to waste.

When you are a seagoing cowboy going many places helps learn how other cultures live. It also helps meet new people and learn new things like how to play sports and whittle if you don't already know. Going to Greece and seeing the Acropolis and like I said before it was special to me. I hope you come with me. But if you don't then you are missing out on a real good treat.",3,6,0.753461480140686

One time my friend, Don Reist, and I went to New Orleans after the Pacific War had ended. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, and we headed to Greece with the cargo of 335 horses with enough oats and hay to feed them. That was my first order, and I had fun.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, such as myself. Besides getting to help others, I had the side benefit of getting to see Europe and China. When I first went to Greece, I saw the Acropolis. I had also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. See, there are many adventures you can take on side of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

One time when I was going to China, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings always kept me busy. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luckily for me, helping my aunt Katie out on her farm as a boy had prepared me for hard work, just not for the dangers of the sea. As another example, if you had the experience I did of helping on the farm you have been slightly prepared with hard work.

One dark rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot my feet torward an opening on side of the ship. The only thing keeping me from falling overboard into the deep, dark, and dangerous Atlantic Ocean was a small strip of metal along the edge. I was really happy to still be alive. But, I couldn't work for a couple of days because of some cracked ribs. I'll admit it, there some dangers working as a Seagoing Cowboy. But, the people there really look after you, and they care about you.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. Participating in the program opened up a whole new world for me. I am really grateful for the opportunity. The program helped make me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.                 ",4,6,0.7972685098648071

When I arrived in Greece I was 18, which meant I could be drafted for military service. When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.

For example, '' I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china. But seeing the Acropolis in greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Pananama Canal on my way to China.'' Now I bet you see how fun it is to be a Seagoing Cowboy, so come and join!",2,6,0.8094667196273804
0e2b2aa,"When my friend Don Reist offered me on a trip to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I had to say yes, I knew I would never be able to do ever again. It was really fun doing it and special at the same time because I got to help people in need and see Europe and China. I also played a lot off games and we got to just sit there and look at the Pacific Ocean.

First off the best part was that I got to help people in need. I mean these people had nothing everything they had got like wipped out. I got to go all over the place just helping people. All the places we got to see were all so pretty and delightful. By the time i go discharged i had alredy made nine trips that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Next getting to see all over Europe and China was also really fun. I got to take a gondola ride in Vencice,Italy, that is the city with streets of water. A fun part was after the animals got unloaded. We played games like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whitting in the empty holds were the animals used to be.

Finally all in all the trip made me understand there are people in other countries that need help. If you were everable to do this and you did I bet you really enjoyed yourself. Hopefully by all of these details you will want to sign up for a trip to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It is not all fun and games, your really have to do stuff like feed the animals. If it wasn't for my friend Don Reist I would have never got to witness this amazingness.",2,6,0.735030472278595
0e4855c,"Luke's point of view is that other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason is because you get to go to different places. Another reason is because Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with Katie.

You get to go to different places like Greece, and by time he got to Greece he was 18 years old that meant that he could draft for military service. Then he could see Europe and China. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossing kept luke busy. They had to feed and water them two to three times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with aunt Katie's farm as a boy had perpared Luke for hard work but not the dangers at the sea. He had different jobs each time. The second time he was a watchman. And his job was to check the animals every hour.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It had opened the world to him. But he was greatful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of of people of other countries and their needs. And the awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That is why Luke's point of view for people to participate in the Seagoing Cow boys. And I think that it would be good for people to do what he did that way you get to go to different places that you may of not been to before. And that way you get to see what it's like on the sea taking care of all the animals and all of the jobs that you have to do.

It would be cool if people would do what Luke did that way you get a learning time where you get to see what it was like for Luke and do what he did I think that it would be cool I we did that. And If we did what he did I think that it would be fun takeing care of the animals and on a sea ride and going to different places that are in different countries to see what there life is like and how they eat and things like that would be cool.",2,6,0.7601363658905029
0e7154c,"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you can be helpful and save lives. While you are helping to save lives you also can be having fun. You would be helping people because sometimes there are natural disasters like hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, volcano eruptions, and many more. Also, you would be able to help people after wars ended. You can help people that have these problems by bringing them food, water, building materials, and other items that they need for daily living. Helping someone always feels fantastic beause you know that you did the right thing.

Being over sea for so long with other people would mean that you would most likely end up being friends. With everybody being friends you would be able to have so much fun. Being over sea with a bunch of friends means that you would be really entertained. This would be enteraining because you could keep yourselves entertained by playing table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games. All of these would pass time. Also, if you have never been on a boat before then you would be able to experience something new! You could argue that being oversea would be to dangerous but here's why your wrong, you would be on a boat that always has someone watching for danger so you would be safe.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program would also be very adventurious. You would get to see new places while doing something good for the world. Have you ever wanted to go across the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean? If so then you would be able to take a boat across it if you participated in this. So, you should take part in the Seagoing Cowboys program.",3,6,0.7597694396972656

If you join you would be helping countries after World War II from all over the world by, bringing them horses, young cows, and mules. You can help nations rebuild since World War II destroyed a lot of land. I know this because in the text it said, To help these countries recover their food, supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.) Some may argue that sending all of the animals overseas might reduce the animal population in that country that is sending them away. But really we have enough cattle in places like America.

Also joining will give you an oppurtunity to visit all of the ancient ruins of a great city. The author wrote, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" On the other hand people will say that they have already seen the Acropolis or China or Europe, but the countries\cities are fascinating. I think you could see them again.

Last it teaches you how to be hard working. I know this because, On the second trip Luke served as a watchman. His job was to check on all of the animals every hour, One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. It teaches you something, but sometimes it's dangerous. Luke almost flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

That was my persuasive essay, do you want to join the program now? I still think more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that seeing the Acropolis in Greece would be amazing as well as seeing China and all of its great places.",4,6,0.6896336078643799

After a few seconds there was mumbling in there was mumbling in the crowd.

""What's that mean?"" Someone shouted.

""What do we do in it?"" Another chimed in.

There were multiple questions being fired in my direction and I was starting to get a headache.

""Lower your voices!"" I shouted as I raised my hands in a stop gesture,""I can't answer your questions when you guys are being so loud.""

Finally th crowd calmed down.

One young man pushed himself to the front of the stage where I was and asked, ""What do we do if we join the program?""

I was prepared for this question and replied,"" Well, in this program you have to help take care of the animals, like horses and young cows, to cross the oceans.""

I felt like that sentence didn't have enough information, so I added,""World War II has ended and we need to assist other countries that have been affected by the war.""

""WIll it be boring?"" One man asked from the back of the crowd. All eyes were on me, their gazes intent on what I was about to say.

I stopped and mulled over my thoughts before answering,""Well, not really. You would be able to see other countries and their landscapes, but you would have to clean the stables and feed the animals. When they are returned to their destination, on the return trips you can have a lot of fun. I had played some sports like baseball and table-tennis with the other boys who had join during one trip back to America.""

The crowd looked interested. I felt like I had said the important parts to persuade them.

""Is it dangerous?"" One person said.

""It can be at time when it's raining extremely hard on deck."" I admitted.

I thought I needed to say more, so I added,""All the adventures you can have will be exciting, but one thing this program has helped me be aware of is the people of other countries and their needs. I played my part in assisting others, will you do the same?""

There was excited murmmuring as everyone surged forward. I felt pride in what I had said.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboy program is an opportunity of a lifetime. While traveling you can see many landmarks or historical sites. Maybe we could see the Great Wall of China sometime!

If your in a Seagoing Cowboys program you could visit many cool places. You could see the Great Wall of China or even The Acropolis in Greece. While being in the program I've been to the Acropolis in Greece and I've ridden in a Gondola in the streets of Venice, Italy. You could visit landmarks and even statues of historical figures.

After delivering the animals and food we clean everything up then we have a bunch of free time. In our free time we play baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to help pass time. We play all these things in the cleaned out stables of the animals. We all have fun! If you were to join us I bet you would have a bunch of fun too.

Well if you do then you would want to join the Seagoing Cowboys club because the club has animals, and takes you around the world to see unique places like Eroupe or Greece, and takes you on a cattle boat mayby you can also see dalphins or even sharks (if you could see the sharks.) First, the club has animals. You can feed the animals and pet them a little I infer that animals are nice. Second. For example the trip takes you to China, or Europe, you can aslo mayby buy a suvenire from those places. I infer that travling is fun. Thirdley, the trip is on a cattle boat witch means you may be able to see a dolphin or mayby even a shark. You can also learn how to mayby fish. You can feed the animals, and go to uniqe places, or go for the first time on a cattle boat. Inifer that there are a lot of dolphins. This trip is well for me sounds exiting and I acually want to pet a goat again. This trip can make you have the expirience of a lifetime, so if you like all theese things the you got to sign in to the club!

For those of you out there who love riding boats or want to ride one, this is the perfect program for you. You can bee on a boat for the longest of a month at a time just going to a place like China.

Also if you love helping for comunity service or helping others this is perfect because you can have fun and help others while in this program. The other cowboys and I played a lot of fun games while abord the boat like baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been held. We also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other activities to help pass time.

My final reason you should join this program is if you love animals this this is the at most best program to join. This is true because you are always near the animals you get to feed them and pet them and even talk to them you know if you like things like that. They also start to seem like your own pets. Just I just want to tell you do not name them. If you name them then you will get to detached and will be really sad when you have to give them up. Trust me I named my favorite horse and it was so hard for me to leave Betsey in China. I hope you will be joining us in this program soon. ",3,6,0.7845714092254639
118d5fb,"From Lukes point of view saying that he wanted people to join participate is that in the begging of the story it said that Luke was working at a grocery store and at a bank. his friend named Don Resit invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke said yes because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In 1945 world war ll was over in Europe and a lot of countries were left in ruins. so that sentence can tell you that if you participated you could help fix countries.

44 nations joined together to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation.

In August 1945 they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived there on August 14th.

Luke was 18 when he arrived in Greece. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. when Luke was helping out on his aunt Katies's farm it had prepared him for hard work. Luke also found time to have fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been housed.

Luke did a lot of things on his free time like, Table-tennis tournaments, fincing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. But being a seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. it lead his family to host a number of interrnational students and exchanged visitors for many years. Luke bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War ll. So I think that from Lukes point of view he might have wanted people to participate in the seagoing Cowboys because it might be nice to help our countries and support us and also to help others around the world who needs help. That's what I think is coming from Luke Bomberger point of veiw.        ",2,6,0.6365653276443481

Luke could not pass this oppertunity and sighned up. After coming home repoters are asking him questions about his trip.

The first reporter asked Luke "" why did you go?""

Luke replys with "" Well it had so many experiences and, I thought I would have many oppertunities and showed me places I had nevver been to and Don and I had the time of our lives.""

The next reporter questioned me "" What oppertunities were in the trip ""

I answer with "" Well I thought if i traveled places I would at least get some gift or somthing remeber it but we just kept sailing, and get some jobs in the other contries which happened I am going to move Tokyo, China next month to be a worker for the main amazon. com factory. And I was happy doing Seacowboys program if you get the chance to do it.

The thrid repoter asked me "" Do you get the same food and shelter as the others""

As I answer my mom calls but i ignore it and she thinks I am dead.

""Yes, we were treated the same as the pilot even though we had to take care of the animals we were treated as humans.""

11bdb65,"A Seagoing Cowboy's Journey

Imagine going to many sites that many people don't normally see and having mulitple adventures around the world. It is an unforrgetable experience that you don't want to miss. You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program becasue of the fun-filled games and freetime, helping the struggling individuals and families, and seeing the unquie sites.

First of all, having some freetime and playing some games onboard is simply a time to relax and enjoy the great experience. Many of you may say that the games don't matter. You just want to travel the world and save as much people as possible. Even though that may be true, I belive that the games benefit in many ways, like making new friends and just having some tine to relax. The cowboys and I have played baseball and volleyball in some empty holds where animals have been housed. Other things to do in your freetime could be reading, boxing, whittling, table-tennis, fencing, and so much more! It has helped me have a better time onboard.

Secondly, helping struggling individuals and families make you feel joyous inside. Some people may say that you don't want to help as many people and go enjoy the amazing sites and play games with fellow companions. And, helping people is really dangerous. But, I belive that if you do, it can make you a better person inside and out. And it doesn't just have to be people either; it can be animals too. Caring for the animals on the way to China kept me busy which was a good benefit because the trip to China took about a month. They had to be fed and watered two to three times a day. It helped me be more responsable and hard working. As for the struugling people, I helped people recover their food supplies, animals and more. The benefits were that same as those with the animals. The knowladge of helping someone or something is one of the best feelings in the world.

Lastly, touring the sites was the best thing for me to experience. Multiple people might say that they don't care about the sights and they just want to do something else. But, I believe that if I didn't see those wonderful sights, I wouldn't be determined or encouraged to finish my job as a Seagoing Cowboy. It was an unbeliveable opportunity for me and it will be for you. I was able to see Europe and China! Two things that were special to me were seeing the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. In Italy, many of the streets are water, which made my experience to Italty even more exciting. On the way to China, I also marveled at the Panama Canal and toured an excavated castle in Crete.

In conclusion, you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because of the fun-filled games and freetime, helping the struggling individuals and families, and finally, exploring the unquie and wonderful sights around the world. I am very grateful for the amazing opportunity and it made me more aware of people and their countire's needs. You should think about participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program today!         ",4,6,0.7885259389877319
11e9122,"I think that people should participate in the seagoing Cowboys program because it makes people more aware of people and there needs. It helps you think of other people instead of just yourself and being selfish. It's a very good job for people because they help people and animals that are lost or hurt and they go sightseeing. They go on many adventures during the job.

Here are some of the places they went while sightseeing. They went to Europe and China they saw the Acropolis in Greece which was special to them.They also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy a city with streets of water. Lastly they toured a excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on the way to China. Those are a lot of places that they have traveled to. Those sound like awesome places to visit.

Whenever they were bored on the boat they would play games like baseball and volleyball. They also play table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling and games that just helped pass time. They would also have the best time unloading the animals that they got which was there favorite thing to do. It is probably a good job because in the beginning of the story Luke talked about how it was an opportunity of a lifetime to have that job which means it must be a special job. He also said at the end of the story that he experienced new adventures like all the things he did so if you like adventures then that's a good job for you. That is why I think people should have this job it sounds like a pretty good job for everyone.

It opens up the world to people and lead his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. Sometimes the job isn't that good like the time Luke fell of the boat and cracked his rib but now he is better. The job will help people and I think that the job would make the world a better place by everyone helping people and caring for the animals. That is why people should get this job to help the world.",3,6,0.8499842286109924

The sea is a beautiful blue place. Who doesn't like the sea? In a story about a cowboy who road the waves he well, rode the waves, Luke was a seagoing cowboy. If I had a chance I would be a seagoing cowgirl. The job involves great animals, lots of unique places, and it is very fun.

First, it has great animals. On the trip

Luke had at least 335 horses to feed, who doesn't love horses? The animals also keep you busy if your bored and they give you company. For animals it isn't that bad that they only have to be checked on every hour. I believe that animals are good company and entertainers.

Next, you can see lots of unique places. On your trip, you get to see Europe and China. You also get to run into The Panama Canal and get a good view of the scenery. The best part you get to take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. This shows that not only you get animals you get lots of unique plaves to go to.

Last, you get to have lots of fun. When the holds that hold the animals are empty you get to play baseball and volleyball in them. You can also have tournments of table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and more. You can also have tournments on reading, and whittling you also get to play games to pass time.

To conclude, a seagoing cowboy involves great animals, unique places, and lots of fun. So work as a seagoing cowboy or cowgirl because no matter what, you will always have a great and beautiful time.",3,6,0.7471619844436646
1259ea4,"Hello everyone I am Luke the Seagoing Cowboy. Today. I think it will be a great opportunity for you too by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. And here let me tell you why.

I started with a help of my friend because I had no choice. He introduced me after the world war II where people still live in the ruins and are starving. It was a good thing for me back then because I had no hope. And that is how it started.

When i joined the program it was hard definaty it a job after all my main purpose was to go of to the seas to another country and help poeple in needs. Through that I was able to go to alot of places, but moving wasent a easy job. I had time when I broke my ribs and could not even work for our crew and that is not all the tides in the oceans are strong very strong and if you were the night watcher too bad. I turned 18 when i was in way to Greece. I was able to be darte d for military service and they said to countine my military service. I also admit but it was a great oppertunity for me. There is also a fun side. When all the cattles were gone our crew was able to stay and play games like vollyball tabletennis,boardgames and lot more it is definatly worth it do ing hard work for all that. You could also tour the citys I visited the Acropolis,the Gondola ride in Venice,excavaded castle in Crete,Panama Canal an the way to China. So now lets go to the actuall reasons why you should join the program:

1. You can tour big places while you are there. That is one of the big reasons I joined the program 2. You can really be aware of waht is going on. I saw th ruins and it was really bad horrible all houses colasped...

3. You can help people in need and are starving for food even though they did not do any thing wrong. I felt really pitty for them beacase the war has not started because of them and they are starvng well for no reason.

I really think that you guys should join the program,ofcourse there are though times, but seeing people get satisfied by my work and visting places for free it is definatly worth at least trying out for this program. This program changed my life it might change yours too.   ",3,6,0.8816072344779968

This administration is a very good program.

You really get the best of both worlds because you could try something new and you get to visit countries that you have never could have. There was a fellow named Luke Bomberger and, his friend asked if he wanted to go on a Europe cattle boat. He took the oppertunity and it changed the whole life for him. He even said that you would find it a hard time to not have fun. On the way there You constantly took care of the cattle and that always kept him busy Luke said. On the back he had a blast with all of his new friends they played: table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fencing,boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that helped him pass time.

This trip will change your life. You should really join this program. It really shows you how lucky we are to have what we have now( technology and other fun games). It is also a fun thing to do with all of the other entertaining activities. If you do it you will be saving thousand and thousands of people but having fun too.

It gives people the opportunity like myself to see amazing places and to help people in need. l have learned more about other countries and I have learned that helping people in need is important. By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy you will also be kept busy by taking care of different animals and if you are a trouble maker this will be perfect for keeping you out of trouble.

One reason you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you will get to tour and see many different places. For example during one of the trips I got to tour an excavated Crete and marveled at the

Panama Canal on my way to China. Also I got to see Europe and China and I was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. I also took a gondola ride in Venice. Being able to tour and visit these different places made me learn more about the world. Another reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that it will keep you busy if you are a trouble maker. You will have to take care of lots of animals by feeding them and giving them water. You will also be kept busy because you will have to pull up bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship and stalls will have to be cleaned. One last reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will be opened up to the world. You will be more aware of people of thier countries and thier needs and you will be more caring and grateful.

I think many young boys should join because people would count on you to be there. Also they would respect you and honor you because of your great leadership.

I started out at a young age and I was so happy traveling with my friends and helping people out. I think that being a seagoing cowboy is much more than just helping people that are hurt. I look on the bright side. I think of it as an adventure. Helping people out is a great adventure, but the bigger one the real one is traveling over the pacific and the Atlantic Ocean several times.

If you do join the seagoing Cowboys you should put a lot of effort in your job. People will be counting on you for you to save their lives. Also if you where ever doubting yourself never do that you are pushing yourself away from your actual dream. If you don't stop doubting yourself you won't go any where in life. You should be a leader and fight for what's right.

You should come on down to be a Seagoing cowboy. It is a great place of family fun. And is a good place for relaxation. Come down if your looking to have the time of your life. The clock is ticking down for this great time of fun.

First of all, comming to be a Seagoing cowboy is a once in a life time event. Just think of Luke in the story. Luke had two jobs without no break. He worked at a bank and, Luke also worked at a local grocery store. It was just another day at work for luke until his friend stoopped by. Luke's friend ""Don Riest"" invited him to go on the Seagoing cowboy trip. Luke couldn't pass an opprotunity like that. So Luke decided to take the spot to go.

When Luke left he was just looking for vacation. But instead Luke got a job as a Seagoing cowboy. Luke, again, could not pass up an opprotunity like that. So because Luke couldn't pass a job like that he accepted the offer of a life time. Luke felt very happy that day of an amazing job for himself. Because Luke knew he was in a great deal for himself and a great help for the Seagoing Cowboys on the boat. He was also a great help for animals.

If you are looking for a place you and the whole family could enjoy. You should come on down to be a Seagoing Cowboy. On the ship we are very popular for fun. On board we have so much activities. We have activities such as volley ball, table tennis, boxing, fencing and many more. So are you going to pass up this once in a life time event you need to get tickets and come down.

Are you looking for a good spot to relax and hang out with friends. You and whoever you want can come down. On this cruiz, you will have a blast. This boat is good for many celebrations. It's good for celebrations such as birthdays, New Year, Christmas and more holidays. So don't blow your only shot of having fun. You should get a ticket ""NOW""!

Doing this beats sitting in a chair behind a desk filling out papers but I guess some people would rather do that then explore.

If I were you I would make my own choice not my friends choice or someone elses choice. When you are doing the seagoing cowboy program you get to go out and ride waves and play games at night time.

Another reason you should go is because you can learn things about the sea and the animals in it. If you already know a lot of things about the animals in the sea and the sea you should still go, because you can learn more and have fun at the same time.

If you don't want to go, but one of your friends are going or you don't want to go and someone is convincing you to just take some time to think about it and then make your second decision. Just remember do what you want to do, not what someone else wants to do.       ",2,6,0.7231124043464661

Many people liked the outcome from their trip and you probably will too. You dont have to do it every year but if you would like to you can. You might be gone from your family for a while.

Can you just picture yourself traveling around and going places that you might only can go one chance out of a lifetime? In the passage in paragraph one it states how Luke felt about going on the trip, ""He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Would you want to miss out? I sure wouldn't. All you have to do is join the UNRRA.

The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administraction. The only bad thing about the trip is that you still have to work. The article includes some information in paragraph 2 that during the program you have to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Your probably thinking ew,no gross, but this is progress of helping the coutries that have been ruined. Keep in mind that this is a good cause, the animals need comfort too.

Next, the good part about the trip is the unique place you would be going. In paragraph 5 it states, ""Luke had made nine trips---the most of any Seagoing Cowboy."" That can be one of your goals if you join the program. Not only did Luke and Don and others just travel they also had free time. They played baseball and volleyball games and many more but they also got to explore freely around the countrie they were in.

There are many reasons why you should join the UNRRA to be a seagoing Cowboys. Some in which include trips, hanging out, ETC. Today we are going to be going over or covering if you will some of the reasons that you should join the seagoing cowboys in the UNRRA.

First of all many people say that you whould nothing out of this organization, but you really get a lot of things out of this organization. One reason you should join the seagoing cowboys is you get many trips around the world. For example, in "" A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke said that he got to go all around the world like: China, Europe, Greece, ETC. You actuall get to go all over the world.

Second is that you get to hang out with people you might not know, and who knows you might make a friend, meet your new best friend or even find that perfect someone for you. If you do meet someone then you would be able to hang out a lot. You could have your first date with that perfect someone in a different contry. How cool whould that be! If you don't believe me you can go back to thee text and look in paragraph 5. If I recall it says that he was able to go see many touring spots, and had a lot more free time then you think.

Speaking of touring that brings me to my next point you are able to go sight seeing and touring. You can go to many places in China and Europe. For example, If you are in Europe and you are close or near Italy you can go and see the leaning tower of piza. For lunch you can go and get some delisous Italian pizza. Now to me that sounds like the perfect day.

Others might argue by saying that all of this is too expensive and it cost a lot of money. What the people that say this don't see is that the organization pays for most of the cost. Sometimes I bet you that the people that go on this trip don't even spend a dime or a penny.

In coclusion as you can see by all of the evidence I have showed that there is no doubt in the world that you should not join this organization UNRRA to become a seagoing cowboy. To me all of this kind of sounds fun like a vacation. It doesn't sound like a job at all it sounds refreshing to be able to be at work while doing soomething that seems like fun and a vacation. In conclusion judging by everything I have stated I think that you should join the seagoing cowboys. I know that I will join the seagoing cowboys, will you join?      ",3,6,0.8312371969223022
13ae3c3,"I think Luke should convince people to join because you will be on a boat with other people. Plus, helping countries recover after world war 2. Help them recover food supplies, animals, and more"".

In the artical it says ""44 nations joined together to form UNRRA to care of animals shiped over seas"". SO, they hire people called ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

They were people who had help feed and protect animals such as horses, young cows, and mules. Also, if you join not only will you help the animals but, you would have lots of fun. Thats why Luke should convince people. He got to see cool places like the Acroplis in Greece and he also Took a ride on the gondola ride in venice, Italy. Witch is a streets filled wth water. He also, went to a ""excavated castle in crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China"". He got to view beautiful places on his way to China and still cared for the animals. Luke has done fun things and been very helpful with the animals.

So, to him feeding animals he also did more then you would imagine thats why people might not want to go because of they think you would only be on a ship for months with fifthy animals. But, he did so much more then clean, feed, and watch or guard the animals. I mean he went on trips to places people who could never afford, or who always dreamed to go! Luke got to see all that for Free only price he had to pay was to love and take care of the animals for countries that need them. All creatures are valueable and should never be treated in a way it dosn't diserve. Who cares if you think siting on a boat with mutiple other people and animals for a month is a waste of time. LUke was on a boat that had about 335 horses. I mean imagine if something had happen to the ship and it sunk! All those deaths of the people and animals that could have saved Millions gone in a flash. This is why I think its a good idea for Luke to convince others to join.

It says that it was a "" opportunity of a lifetime."" It's not normal everyday that you would get a chance to go on ship and see places you never seen before. It's rare to happen but, thats why you should jump up and take it it's one opportuity you will probly never get again. So, don't take the chance thinking this kind of event would ever occur again so do what you want to do and what you think is right. He had visited nine trips on his trip on a boat in a certain amount of days. Maybe others could visit more places like ten. Even, see things on your journey see animals you have never seen before.

Also, the countries too would recover and get stronger. So, let the others know what you have seen on this trip. Join and you too will start your quest to China. Today now start helping others.

In conclusion, this is why Luke should convince others to join because all of these reasons to join for fun, and for helping animals get to were they need to go to help even more people. Theres no way he shoudn't convince others. Just tell them it's for a good cause. You even get to wonder places on way to your destination.

I have seen so manny cool thing on my way to Europe and in Europe. Plus you get to help people. In the book ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves' it states,The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

I wouldn't have become one if my friend Don Reist hadn't talked me into going to Europe. It also says in the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"", ""when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldnt say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.""

You should become one! You would get to help lots of people, see really cool things, and you would be a hero to some people! What do you say? Are you up for it? I'm not going to lie, there are some hard things to it. Once I even broke my ribs and almost died by going over bored on a boat. It says in the story,

A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves, A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. He was happy to be alive. But he couldnt work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.""

Even with that tramatic expirence I love doing what I do and I'm so happy I did and do it. Again I think you would like being one too, especialy if you like helping people. (I'm assuming most people do.)

You would see and do so manny cool things. It's not all work eather. In paragraph 8 in the story it says, ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Then many people want to see what they have to do to help. Also you have your lazy people in this world that don't even give two cares. So how about letting me do some persausion on this subject.

I think that if people participate than there will be a lot less world hunger. So for instants there are people in a different country right now starving, and just waiting for people to show up and help them. And the people that join the Seagoing Cow boys program have a great opportunity to help these other people. They also have a great opportunity to go out and explore many, many countries. If I were a grown man and a friend of mine ask me if I would want to go on an expidition to help another country I would probly say yes just to get to help people around the world.

So well I think that is all and I hope my essay would help people think about this if it ever got published. Also to the lazy people who don't care imagin itf your mom was in one of those countries starving to death. But I guess that is just some people like that I would hope.

One time, I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

I also toured an excavated castle in Crete an marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

I also found to have some fun aboard, espeacially on return trips when the animals had been unloaded.

You'll make new friends along the way, too!

Pharagraph 7 explains how Luke, a Seagoing Cowboy himself, was ready for this hard work mostly because he helped his aunt on her farm as a boy.

Luke shows us how being a Seagoing Cowboy gave him awareness for other people. He also shows us the many impotant things to learn from this job.

First, while being a Seagoing Cowboy Luke learned to take care of many of the animals.

He fed them and gave them water.

These actions, in turn, helped many people that were suffering.

Second, caring for the animals taught Luke to be responsible and to be a hard worker.

In the passage Luke said he had to make sure he fed the animals, give them water every day, and clean the stalls.

He also said ha had to be a night guard and check on the animals every hour to make sure everything was okay.

Next, other than taking care of the animals and doing different work, Luke also got to see new things and have fun.

He said he saw China, Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete,and the Panama Canal.

He also went on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Even on the boat Luke had fun.

He and the other cowboys played baseball and volleyball games, had tournaments, and did other enjoyable things.

Finally, Luke saw people that were hurting and that needed his help.

Luke said '' I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' and that '' It made me more aware of people...''

Because of the Seagoing Cowboys program, Luke helped many others, even after he was discharged from the program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was a eye opening adventure for Luke.

It can also be a life changing experience for other people too.

They can learn lessons and help people just like Luke did.

It may also change their outlook on life. They may want to do more to help others in need, rather than just helping themselves.              ",3,6,0.6910227537155151

But that's not the only good thing about the program, once you drop off the animals, the crew members play baseball and volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass the time on the way to our next destination.

Before you get to have all the fun and free time, you have to take care of the animals. That means feeding and watering them, but there are some risks. On my second trip, I was put on duty as a night watchman, and one rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slipped on a wet step and fell down the ladder on my backside. My heart was beating faster than ever as I shot towards an opening on the side of the ship. Luckily, there was a small strip of metal along the edge that stopped me from plunging into the Atlantic, but I had cracked my ribs, disabling me to do work for a few days.

When I was on that ship it felt good. I was around all the animals. I mean who wouldnt want to go on a trip. The air out there feels good, taking care of animals was also a lot of fun. And being with my friend made it better. When he asked me if I wanted to go, I couldnt say no. Id never get a chance like this again.

I cracked my ribs but that didnt stop me from enjoyong where I was. My ribs hurted bad but this was an incident, a little mistake but a big combat. But that did stop me from enjoying the things around me. I even visited some cool places while a shore. Seeing the big blue ocean and waves was pretty. Helping out was a fun job. The animals were all friendly and the games that were played were fun to watch and to participate.

Being on night watch was scary because it was pitch black and the boat was very rocky. I got thruough the night eventually so everything was ok. Having people there with me and everyone being friendly

was a nice feeling. In my opoinion, I think everyone should have this experience because somed people have never been to sea, or they never ridden on boat before. Its alot of fun there and a nice place to explore and be with animals and just kind of relax.

In the end, I had alot of fun. A little mishap happened but other than that it was a ball of joy. Everyone should get a chance really. To have a nice experience on the ocean instead of being afraid to go because of sea sick and stuff. Itll be alot of fun if people go.

I think you should join it because there is so many sights that we can see on our ways across oceans on boat trips, it's an opportunity to work hard, and it's fun.

The first reason I think you would enjoy this program is because there is so many sights to be seen. I saw many sights. I saw the excavated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I also, took a ride on a Gondola in Vencie, Italy a city with streets of water. Like I said these are all wonderfull sights you could see. There is one sight I think was the most special and that was the Acropolis in Greece. Europe and China are a couple other sights. The boat trips do take a while though. For example, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China. These are many sights that make this program super enteresting and fun.

The next reason I think you should join this program is because it's an opportunity to work hard and show others what we can do. There are many opportunities to do, expecially if you are on the cattle boat. Some of the things to do are, caring for animals, and makeing sure they have been fed and watered, pullying bags of oates and bales of hay from the lower holds of the ship to the upper, and cleaning the stalls. These many things were hard work.

cleaning the stalls was every night and the animals had to be checked daily and nightly to make sure none of them were hurt and fed and watered properly. All of these responsabillities are hard work.

Just because there's hard work dosen't mean theres not any fun, because there is. once the animals and cargo are all dropped off there is time to have fun on board, The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Tabletennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. As I said before there are many things to do fun it's not always just seriousness. There is time to goof around and have fun too .

Like I had said before, there are many reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join this program because there are so many sights to see on boat trips, it's an opportunity to work hard, and there's time to have fun. I hope this makes you want to join this program because it's a good time to shine. Well, not really shine but, you know what I mean.",4,6,0.658009946346283

On top of that we even get to see Europe and China! If you actually think about it it is really an amazing job. I think my favorite place so far was seeing the Acropolis in Greece it was very special.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboys is going to literally change your life!!

Such as when Luke mentions that he took a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city with streets of water or when he saw the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help many people. Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy meant that he supplied poor areas in Europe with cattle to recover their food supplies, animals, and more.

The reason why I say it is fun to be a Seagoing cowboy is, because as Luke mentions when all of the cattle was unloaded they often played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and baseball and volleyball games. Luke also mentions that being a Seagoing Cowboy was an oppurtunity of a lifetime that he would not want to miss. Luke aslo mentions that caring for the animals on these long voyages often kept him busy along with other things he had to do such as, feeding the animals, watering the animals two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an interesting job. Your never bored, your always seeing places, and your always having fun. Whats not to like about it? For Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more the adventure, but it opened up the world to him. He also so said that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

He helped take horses to greece on ship and that is hard to do with 335 horses on bored the ship,and he had to take care of them by feeding them,getting the poop up and out of there cage. When he was helping one night he almost fell off bored the ship and went into the dark Atlantic but lukly there was a melt bar that stopped he from falling off the edge of the ship.

When the horses got off the ship the men could play basketball,volleball,and table tennis with all the men on bored.

Reson #3 is that you could meet new people learn other languiges too. Also you cold become part of a family they could take you in and youk cold have another really close friend from some were far far away from were you live.

In the story Luke said""It would a chance of a life time."" An I think it would be a chance of a life time. In my opinone I would do it. I would love to go on a trip tio eventure around the world. I love learning new cultres and to see what what it could help me with in my life. Also that it would be cool to do a report on all the places that you whent to in the proses. If I were him or any one els that got the opertunity I would say yes to doing it.

In my family its important to learn and get youst to doing thatbecause my famoly dose alot of edventering. We go to the D.R, Hawaii Colorado, and alot more places too. I think that any kid that gets invited should that, because what they learn stiks to them and it stays with them for a long time and if they dont then they missed a big opertoonity to do that.

I went to the DR for the first time when is like 5 years old and I learnd a lot of spanish when i as there. I also made a lot new friend people my age people that older younger than me too. An we bonded rely whell and i didnt know how to speek a word of spanish!!! I had a translator that helped me know what they were saying tio me and for them to tell the kids what i was saying too. i leand a lot of spanish when i wa there and i still know to say a lot of things in spanish too. I still kow my beat friens name in the D.R. We taught eachother how t say the alfabet in English and Spanish.

Just saying I had the best time of my life and I stayed in the same place the hole time and I still lernd a lot in one day.

And the hole time I was there I was so happy till it came to the part when I had to say by to all my new good friend that I made there. Its hard to leave but then you get to all the other places and meet other people there too.

People that want to explor should do this in order to see what ist like and if thay want to do this for the a long time or not. Just one time at a different place then were you live is awesome because you never want to leave. You could also go see uther animal sthat you have never seen befor in a zoo or that you have never herd of too. I love to see knew thing even if I have heard of it,or not, or seen it, or not it is still really cool to experiance that. An I think kids, aldolts, teens, or eve the elderl would stil love to see that or experiance that time with the family.

Helping tend to the animals really kept me busy but it was worth helping others after World War Two. If you become a night watchman you check up on the animals every hour. You may also have to feed and water them two or three times a day. Bales of hay and oats would have to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship. Last but not least you may have to clean the stalls. I experienced each one of these jobs including being a watchman. If you do not like to work, doing this job may not be right up your alley.

You also get to see cool and interesting places like Venice, Italy. Since the streets there are water, I got to take a gondola ride! I also went to Greece and saw the Acropolis. That was a special experience for me as well. Another activity you might see is going to an excavated castle in Crete on the way to China. One last thing I saw was the Panama Canal also on my way to China.

Another thing I experienced that you might to if you join is finding times to have fun on the ship, especially on the way back. The stalls were turned into courts for boisterious games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, and boxing. A more calm and layed back activity we did was reading and other games to pass the time.

It is a really good way to see places that you have wanted. For example Greece or Venice which are some of the many places that Luke went to when he was part of the program.

Luke even says that the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. You might get the chance to help people that were affected by World War II. You would also help in delivering horses, young cows, and mules overseas.

These are the reasons why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is helpful to other places to because you are giving them important things they need to survive and strive.

In the story there was a boy named Luke and he had just graduated from high school. He was working two part time job at the grocery store and at the bank. Then one day one of his friends invited him to go to Europe

on a cattle boat. Luke knew that this was a great opportunity for him to go with him so he did. In the story Luke did lots of travling and it sounds like he really enjoyed himself. I believe that peole now days should do these type of things today.

My first reason why I believe that people should do these things today is because lots of people are lazy and do not do anything but sit around on their phones or either on a video game. It hurts peoples brains and its a waist of peoples lives. I think that alot of people would enjoy doing lots of other things then just staying at home laying down not doing anything. In the story Luke seem to have had a fun and great time experiencing lots of diffrent places in the world.

My second reason is because we really could learn something about our world. We can experience it without using google or siri. It could be a fun way to actually be right infront of the place or be inside of the place. You could take lots of pictures in there. Also you would feel proud of yourself. You would feel proud of yourself by saying I travled there world

before I

died I actually did something with my life other spent time at home on my phone or Xbox or other device.

My third reason is you could take a vacation with your family and go to some place like the Panama Canal. Also you could go to somewhere like Russia, Italy,Sweeden, and lots of other places you could choose.

My forth reason is in the story Luke says that it would be a great opportunity to go travel the world. That tells me that he was instreasted in travling the world with his friend. Also at the end he got hurt and cracked his ribs. He could not work for a coulpe of days but he still enjoyed himself hurt or not hurt.

In conclusion it would be just a fun journey to do and discover. If you could go travle the world would you do it? Or would you rather stay home being lazy on your phone? These are some question you would have to ask yourself. This is why reasons on why I think it would be a good idea.",3,6,0.5603727698326111

The first reason is that if you care about animals this is the right job for you because, at this job you have to take care of them by feeding and cleaning. The animals you will be taking care of are horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped over sea. The second reason is that if you want to be a cowboy, this is the right job for you because, you are dealing with cows, horses, and mules like every cowboy or girl.

Other people might have an argument about it. They might say that it's boring and stupid but, it's really not boring or stupid. It would be really fun if you wanted to be a cowboy or cowgirl, and liked animals",2,6,0.8140990734100342

______________________________

There are many reasons that you should consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a very fun activity to participate in. In this essay I will be stating a few reasons on why I believe that you should consider participating in this program.

One reason is because you will mostly be on a boat at all times during this program. While you are on this boat you will be traveling all across the world. We all know that there are not many things to do on a boat but on these boats there most definitly be things to do. Such as sight seeing, Touristing, and much more!

Another reasosn is because say you like to get out of the house, well this will be one great oppourtunity for you to do so. Reason being because you will probably be gone for a long period of time on each trip. Plus it will take even more time because you are on a boat, and those things arent very fast. So if you are one of those people who do like to get out of the house for a long time this will be your chance to do so.

My third and final reason is because you will jus have a fun time. Mostly because there will be tons and tons of things to do on these Fun adventures. A couple of things that you might consider doing is if you are docked in paris for a few go check out the ifal tower, Or if you are docked in Washigton D.C. why not go see the White House and maybe you could even have the chance to meet the president himself.

In conclusion there many reasons you should consider taking on the Challenge of being a Seagoing Cowboy. One reason is because you will be able to see things like never before. Another is because you will be out of the house for a long period of time on each of these Adventures. Last but not least is because you will simpily just have fun.        ",3,6,0.8165634274482727

And they hired us to help them.

It will be an adventure to travel all over the world helping people and animals (also Luke's words). We have alot of fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Besides the benefit of helping people we travel the world we go to different countries with friends that soon become family on this adventure.

First of all, you can meet new people. Others may argue and say that not all people are friendly.However, if you meet someone from another counrty and learn more about that counrty and what has been going on in the counrty. You can learn about thier cultrues and what the believe in. They Can show you the type of food that is native to their counrty. I infer that if you join the Seagoing Cowboy program you will meet new people.

Second, you can help people. Others might argue and say that people are not always going to be thankful. However, you won't need them to be thankful you will now that you did the right thing. Imagine a counrty that just lost a war and need help to recover. That's where the Seagoing Cowboys program come into play. They will be there to bring supplies to help. They can give the counrty food and shelter to survive. I believe that if you join the Seagoing Cowboy program.

lastly, you can travel the world. People may argue and say that it could be dangerous. However, it could give you the chance to see thing you have only hear about on the radio or seen pictures of. it would be fun because you would be able to got to several diffirent counrties in a single day! You can finally be able to see the things other people have built. Imagine going back home and telling your friends and family members about what you have seen.

If you are in the program,you get to go to amazing countries. These countries may include Europe, China, Greece, and wherever else they need you. In the story it stated that Luke, (me) , a Seagoing Cowboy, toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It was very fun to stay at the countires and to look at the amazing views as we went through.

In the program, you not only get to travel to amazing places, but you also get to help people and animals too. The UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals and people. We sail overseas with the animals and take care of them until we can get it to the people.

On the way back, the Seagoing Cowboys get to have a lot of fun playing games. We play baseball, volleyball,etc. We also do boxing,fencing,and other tournaments like those. We do this to pass the time on the way back and for all the hard work we have done over that time period we were helping the animals.

In the story it states that once on a trip I had a near death experience trying to help the animals on the ship. Although this is true, this event is very unlikely to happen, and I am still safe due to a piece of metal coming in my way to save me.

You or a family member should become a Seagoing Cowboy. You get to not only help people and animals, but you also get to travel through amazing countries, and get to have fun on the way back. The Seagoing Cowboys help a lot of people and it is very fun, and for those reasons you should become one of us, or better known as a Seagoing Cowboy.             ",4,6,0.9062559604644775

The reason you should join this program is because on your extra time you can go sight seeing and look at what you will be passing on the jorney from place to place. The task you are asked to do is simple and you can do a variety of things on your way back home.

If you join this program then you could travel half way around the world, see different things, be in the millitary, help people, and work all at the same time. When you join this program you can see things like ruins and famos statues. Luke joined and look what he seen. He seen Europe, China, an excavated castle, and the Panama Canal. You don't see those things on an average day. If you join you can see all these things and have a life time expereince.

When you are on this voage all you have to do is feed the animals and water them two or three times a day. The bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship, so you might need some mucles. You also have to clean the stalls daily, which I know is a nasty job but someone has to do it. You also get the benefit of hellping families in need.

On the way back home you can also have fun by playing games with your friends in the empty stalls. It might not be the most sanatairy place but what else is there to do. Luke says that he and his friends play: Table-tennis, fencing, boxing,voley ball, base ball, and reading. This helped pass the time of the long jorney back home. This program could be fun even if you are in a ship and in animal stalls.

This why I think that joining this program would be good. You get to go sighting seeing, work, and have fun at the same time. Who would want to miss this opportunity of a life time like this one.         ",3,6,0.6311742067337036

The text states that luke was always trying to help people with thing like rideing a boat to pacific ocean twice to help people affected by the world war two. It was 1945 , when the world war two was over. The text states that they were going to help recover countries food supplies,animals,and more. Thats why luke couldnt say no too his friend Don Reist and the story says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Thats why UNRRA hired "" Seagoing Cowboys""

So luke and don sign up for helping other countries. The people begin to help them. That means that everthing went into plan.

Oh how much fun that was on that boat with all of the lovely animals and my friends.

One of the best things about the trip was all the friends I made, you know playing games and stuff.

I know what you're thinking; what about all of that hard work the whole time.

Well on the way back the only thing that we did was play games, read, and everyonce in a while we would have to clean off the docks.

There were no animals on the way back and thats why it was so fun.

On the way there it was pretty hard work taking care of the animals, but we only had to that every hour, and even then we all pitched in and helped.

If you're thinking about how long it took, it really just depends on how fast you work.

There in't really much to say about the work that hasnt been said, the point is it's not that hard.

The best part about the trip was all the places that we stopped at along the way.

One of the best ones was when we stopped at Greece and I saw the Acropolis.

We also stopped at Vince Italy, the city had streets of water.

We also visited Europe and China, plus im even including the fact we helped so many people along the way.

This is the best thing that could have happened to a small town boy like me.

The only reason why I got to go on this amazong trip was because of one of my friends told me about it.

I guess I'm just trying to be a good friend to and give you the life changing trip.

Just think about it.

All that I'm really trying to say is that this is the most amazing that happened to me and it all I had to do was take care of a couple of animals with my some of my closest friends.",3,6,0.726625919342041

Anyone who wants to see the the amazing world should definitley sign up to be a seagoing cowboy. This really is the oppurtunity of a lifetime for everyone who is dieing to get out of the house.

Some people may love home but really want to go on this trip. They also may not want to leave their beautiful family behind all by themselves. It might be possible that they are just scared to travel to an unknown place, but, being a seagoing cowboy allows the cowboys to only take one trip to help others, have fun, and see the world. It won't take very long at all!

Being a seagoing cowboy is an amazing job to take. The cowboys get to help other countries, have fun, and see the world and all of its beauties.

Luke had this insadent when he cracked his ribs during a storm on night when he was going to go report to the captin. Im sure you will be ok.

This is once in a lifetime thing so dont miss out. Just make sure that youjr parents are ok with it. We only take 12 to 21 year old so dont miss out. Are you ok with going out on the open seas and taking care of aniamuls. Well if you do then be a seagoing cowboy!

Dont worry you loving parents at home we will have fun activitys while the animals are off at thier new home. If you parents like you can donate some animals to the other countyrys arcross the world! It would be a pleasure if we could have your kid help us get the sullpies the other countrys need becuse they are in ruins and they need our help.

We understand is you dont want to see your child go for a few months but this is saving those other countrys that are in ruins and need our help.

And is only be 1 year since and these countrys still are depending on us Seagoing Cowboys to save the day. Everyone in the counterys are dieing every hour if we dont get there in time to save the day for this unforgiving war. If we dont help these people then who will? Thats right NOONE WILL.

People will die if we dont help them. Thats why we need your help. Luke has claimed ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acorpolis in Greece was special."" Luke has also said ""We arrived August 14 the day the Pacific war ended."" He was a Seagoing Cowboy for more than 9 trips!

That is the challange that your captin will have given to you if you chose to be a Seagoing Cowboy. The trip will be hard possibly rainy but you get to see other citys towns or even new countrys!

Of this to do if you get bored with No animals on boared to take care of while you are sailing the open deep sea waves of the Alantic,Pacific,or Articx ocean.

Just remeber saftey first because one time Luke was a Watchman on sea and he was supossed to check on the animals and he was going to go tell the captin about the hourly cheack up onm the animals when the wet ladder he was climbing down. That was BAM he fell of the ladder be sqid he was glad to be alive in the very sacary moment and thast is why we keep pushing the fact that safetyu first for our Seagoing Cowboys.

Traveling? Definetely! I've traveled to so many places. Some of my favorites are Greece, China, and Italy. My favorite part about Greece was the Acropolis. On my way to China, I saw the Panama Canal. I loved taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and adventuring an old castle in Crete was pretty cool.

If you're a big animal lover, this job may be for you. I've taken care of hundreds of animals. My first shipment contained 335 horses! Along with the horses, enough hay and oats to get them through the trip. The trips were very long so taking care of the animals kept me busy and as long as I was busy, they were healthy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all what luke did, he loved seeing places like Greece,China. But his favorite was Acropolis in Greece. Caring for the animals keep Luke bissy. But on one rainy night he slipped on a ladder, a stip of metle saved him from falling over. But even with two cracked ribs he still had fun on the boat.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was a adventure for Luke Bomberge. It made him more aware of people im other countries and there needs. Well I hope you like that storie about Luke Bomoberger. Also I hope you join the Seagoing Cowoys, If you do i bet you will have so much fun",2,6,0.7855722904205322
1b5c960,"How would you like to join the Seagoing Cowboys,I think you sould join the Seagoing Cowboys because you get to go all around the world. you can also have lots of fun.

First I think you should join Seagoing Cowboys bacause you can go all around

the world. For example, the subtitle states ""Luke Bomberger had been over the alantic ocean sixteen times and the pacific two times. Another example says in paragraph 4 that when he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had already made nine trips that was more than any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke was only eighteen when he first went to Greece.

Lastly, I think you should join because you can have lots of fun with your friends. In paragraph 8 the text talkes about how they had fun after unloading animals off the boat. They did thing such as playing table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and more. Also games helped pass the time.

I think these paragraphs should have inspired and persuaded you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.      ",2,6,0.8541947603225708
1b92860,"MOO! There are many animals a seagoing cowboy has to care for and deliver.

I Luke Bomberger was asked by my friend Don Reist to try out the program. Being a seagoing cowboy is a lot of fun, you can do a lot of things as one. You help people in need by giving them things they need. There are many reasons to join the seagoing cowboy program.

I started out by heading to Greece, and I turned eight-teen. I was old enough to be drafted then, but when my draft board figured out I was on a cattle boat they said to keep doing it as my draft service. When I was discharged I had made nine trips. I had went to Europe and China when I was a seagoing cowboy. I had fallen once, but I didn't go overboard. During your trips you have to care for the animals, by feeding them and giving them water.

When you're not working, you can do many things, like play games, read, and even fence. You can also see some places off the boat. When I was little I used to help out on my aunt's farm. It helped prepare me for being a seagoing cowboy. I had a lot of fun being a seagoing cowboy, because there were so many things to do.

You should be a seagoing cowboy, because you will be able to care for many animals, and you can see other countries. You can also play games to pass the time between trips. Being a seagoing cowboy would be the time of your life. You could help others while having fun yourself. It is a great program that helps others.

There are many reasons to join the program, like the ones I just mentioned. You can spend your time having fun, or you can just try it out to see if you like the program. You might end up how I started, by trying it out and end up liking it. You should join the program, because it helps people in need. In the future there might be other programs like this one.",2,6,0.8659869432449341

Caring for animals all day on a boyt can be very hard work, but it is alway fun and intergetic work. It is the most exciting adventure you could ever do in your life time, so just try it. When I first heard about the trip it was like th emost amazing thing ever.

Never before in my life had anything seemed so great. The trip wass fantastic, just all the scenery and things you saw. You get to meet and be with other Cowboys. You learn to trust and like to be with animals. It just so I would really advise you to at least try it and see how you like it at sea for so long.

You get pulled in right away whoever you are old or young. There are games such as table-tennis tournaments,fencing, boxing, and the cowboys also play baseball and volleyball in the stalls where there aren't any animals in. You could also read, or wittle to help pass the times when you didn't have anything to do. You aso have a lot of oppertunities to do diferent jobs aound the bout.

When I was on my second round giong along with the Seagiong Cowboys I surved as a night watchman. When you get this job you have to go around every hour and check on the animsls and see if they are all right. While diong this I slipped and fell which was a scarey thing because I wa sheaded strait for the edge of the bout. Lucky me I was caught and only had a brocken rib.

You can also become a very well know person if you do oit right. I am so thankful I went to help, as I said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" I have helped so many international students and and exchange visitors for years. This trip has made my life such a bliss since I agreed to sign up for that trip to take care of the animals while they get shipped across the ocean from place to place and to time.

As I have been telling you just try to and juust see how you like it. When I came oout of high school I was working two part- time jobs and had a best freind named Don Reist. When he came up to me and askekd me if I would do it I couldn't say no. I knew this would be my only chance in a life time. So why don't you try this, or if you don't like it tey something else. Just just do what your heart tells you to do, and be happy.  ",4,6,0.7528252601623535
1be4323,"why should we participate in being a Seagoing Cowboy? Some people ask but barley anyone knows. This might help us some times. But I think this will tough. We should do this, because it might help us, you sometimes get free time, and it is easy.

This job might help us alot. We can earn money and get a new house. You are shipping things. Things like milk dairy and other things. You could get a new house or a new car it might be able to be big small or whatever size you want it to be.

On this job you sometimes get freetime. You get freetime if you work hard on your job. The games we can play are like Poker, Cards, and more. If we don't want to play games we dont have to play any games. Therefore it is your choice if you want to play games or not.

Lastly this job is very easy. Mostly because all you have to do is ship crates with animals in them. The story says Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The job is probaly the easiest job you can find. So if you want this job for any reason it is a great job.

The job is great for all of these reasons. if you frogot what they were the reasons are that it might help us, you sometimes get free time, and it is easy. I think this job would be great for any of us. So if you want this job and if I were you then I would take it. Therefore I think this is a great job.",2,6,0.7849121689796448

One of the best parts is that you wont have to work all the time becuase in paragraph 8 it says that they had fun activities to help pass the time. This great oppertunity opened lukes eyes to the world and the people around it. If you are planning on doing this then i think you should do it because it is such a great oppernunity.

In paragraph 9 luke sayes that being a seagoing cowboy was much more then an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world for him. If you are planning on being a seagoing boy imagine all the places and people you will be able to meet. You will be able to see so many different coultures and how other people live. Would'nt that sound like so much fun it would be an adveture you will never forget.

Imagine being 18 and traveling around the world. Not every 18 year old gets the oppertunity to travel to Greece or China or Europe. Now that would be great. Traveling at a yound age.

You may not know what a Seagoing Cowboy is but that is why I'm hear to explain. Seagoing Cowboys get to experience what it's like to tavel to different countries, learn respinsibility, and learn about cultures they might never even heard of. We would like you to be our newest Seagoing Cowboy. After your first trip you might even want to invite your friends to become a Cowboy too.

Seagoing Cowboys see new places, because of the work that they do. They must take food, animals, and supplies to countries who can not grow and thrive after tragic accidents. In the passage Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist become Seagoing Cowboys and work together on a boat traveling to Europe. In Europe the people had just fought in World War II and had no food or supplies, not even animals. So the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration sent supplies and animals on a ship to help the people in Europe.

Seagoing Cowboys learn responsiblity by taking care of the animals and crew members on board their ship. In the article Luke must take care of horses, young cows, and mules by giving them water and food, cleaning the pens, and pulling hay and supplies from the lower decks. Seagoing Cowboys not only take care of animals they have to watch out for one another. In the passage Luke was almost knocked overvoard but thankfully a strip of metal caught him and his crewmates pulled him back aboard.

The people who do sign up to become Seagoing Cowboys get to travel around the world and learn about new cultures, eat new and interesting foods, and even get to see amazing landscapes and structures. In the passage Luke got to see the Panama Canal, a castle in Crete, and even spend time in China and Europe. Luke took nine trips from one place and back again-that's the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Seagoing Cowboys have great experiences. They learn new thingss and see new places. Plus who doesn't love working with animals. It would be a great experience and lots of fun to be a boy or man to travel to new countries and learn new things. We hope to see you on our next trip and have a great time.

1cb6294,"Luke Bomberger was a seagoing cowboy. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice to help people affected by world war ll. He took care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Along his trip he got chance to visit many places. He had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But to him seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special he also said that taking that gondola ride in Venice, Italy also was.

He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did. During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy.

He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian. One day he was doing his normal rutien, and he had slid down a slippery ladder an his backside and when he slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean. Helping on his aunt Katie's farm when he was young had prepared luke for hard work.

1cc6247,"Helping out people in other contries with the UNRRA makes me feel good inside. Let me tell you why everyone should join the UNRRA's seagoing

cowboy program

First and for most , it is very fun. We play all the average games like baseball , volleyball ,

table tennis , fencing , boxing and ready. Another

way we have fun is with the animals. Watching the baby horses play is adorable.

Last but not least my friends and I have fun. We tell jokes and play pranks . You know the usual guy stuff.

This program teaches responsiblity. I am in charge of the animals and I have to feed and water them 3 times everyday and clean their stalls once a week. It may not sound fun but it is worth it when you see the light in peoples eyes when they recive one of our animals.

As well as responiblity you get certain rewards. On my free time I like to see the awesome structures that the people have in their cities. In total I have gotten

one gondola ride , 2 trips to Acropolis and 1 trip to the Panema Canal.

These are only the three top reasons why everyone should join this program. and if you are interested the UNRRA always needs new people!                            ",3,6,0.6645983457565308
1cd7165,"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Most people think that all you do is work, like taking care of animals. However, there are ways for you to have fun while working. You can play games, read a book, or even see cool sights. Here are a couple of things you could do.

First of all, you can see many different sights and explore while traveling. I know that I have visited some really cool places, like seeing an excavated castle in Crete. You can also see many different things. You could see the beautiful, wavy water or see a beautiful sunset while you travel. Another place I think you should visit is the Panama Canal. So, if you ever get bored and don't anything else to do, you should some beautiful sights and marvelous places. You may never know what you see and even make new friends along the way.

Second of all, you could play games if you get bored. The Seagoing Cowboys program isn't just all about working for animals. It's about having fun and playing games. For example, I know when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys, we would play games, like table tennis, baseball, and even volleyball. You could also read too, if you would like. Where would you play these games, you ask? Back then, we would play in the empty holes where the animals have been housed.

Third of all, you could just have fun. You could read a book, play games, or even relax. Talk to the animals while you take care of them. If all you do is work and no fun, then you are going to not like being part of the Seagoing Cowboys. I remember when I did do a lot of fun stuff, but I had to do work first. I would like to tell you a very good story. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down the steps, but luckily I made it okay. I just couldn't work a couple of days because

I had cracked ribs. Trust me on this point. If you say to people that you had a great time, they would probably want to join too.

In conclusion, I made very good and understanding points. First, go visit some sights and places while you explore. Not only could you explore new worlds, but you could also meet new people and try out different languages. Second of all, you could play games. If you play games like volleyball and baseball, you will be more happier when you play games that if you just do work all the time and not have any fun. You will get bored and most likely not enjoy yourself all that much. Third of all, have fun. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for these reasons.

If you want to join there is some bad news. One of the reasons why is that it takes two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean to get to the eastern coast of the United States and it took a month to get to China and another reason why its hard to be a Seagoing Cowboy is that if your 18 you have to join the military service.

Here in the Seagoing Cowboys program you are able to help people, travel the world, and also have fun a long the way. Now I will tell you about the experiences I have had as a Seagoing Cowboy and why you should join.

First I am going to tell you why I became a Seagoing Cowboy. When I graduated high school I had no idea what to do. Until my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't say no. I knew it was an opportunity of a life time. Then I started my journey.

It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. These countries needed food supplies, animals, and more to recover. Thats when 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA was an administration that hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of animals that were shipped overseas. Thats when Don and I signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys.

After the Pacific War ended in August, 1945. We received orders to report to New Orleans. The orders were to ship a corgo of 335 horses, plus enough hay and oats to feed them to Greece. The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to opportunity to travel to many different places. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and crossed the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War 2. I have also been to Europe and China. But seeing Greece was special to me.

Most people think being a Seagoing Cowboy is all hard work and that we don't have any fun. The people who say that are very wrong, Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of fun on their spare time. When we finish our orders we take some time off and do fun activites. In Venice, Italy, I took a gondala ride over a city with streets of water. In China I also toured an excavated castle, and marveled at the Panama Canal. Another way we have fun is on board. When the ships have been unloaded we play baseball games, vollyball games, fenceing, boxing, and many other fun things to help pass time.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help people in need, travel the world, and have fun a long the way. Being a Seagoing Cowboy has been much more than an adventure for me, Luke Bomberger. It has opened up the world to me.                         ",3,6,0.8634600043296814

That is why I believe participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good thing cause you can help other countrys in need.

In the story it sate i paragraph 6 that the boy Luke that was in the Seagoing Program he was over seas for two weeks before he had got to china. That is one of the reason why i think that being in the Seagoing Cowboys is a good way for you to go places you never been before

Last, the passage state in paragraph 9 that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that a adventure for Luke Bomberger. This is why I choose to think that it is a great idea to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program cause you can see stuff that you never in your life seen before and have adventures.

First example is that you might go to a gift shop and get you some things to take back to your country.

Seagoing Cowboys are a great way to help other countries. We get more freedoms than any other country. So, we should help by becoming Seagoing Cowboys.

We should all be helpful. Though our country is in lack of willingness to help, doesn't mean we shouldn't help. To be more factual we should all be willing to become a Seagoing Cowboy. You don't just get the privelage to help people in need, you get to see other parts of the world, you may never see otherwise!

1e5bfd5,"In the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke was a young seventeen-year-old boy who couldn't turn down the opportunity of a lifetime to go to Europe and help with the horses.

Some of the reasons to join the seagoing cowboys is that they get to see tons of awesome landmarks. If you love horses and cattle then is most likely the job for you. You get to enteract with them and feed them care for them like they were your own. Even if you just want to help out your world out then this could be the job for you.

It's amazing how much stuff you can do there to when the jobs done you might be able to look at the pretty things there. Sometimes if your lucky you have to go right through town so you get to see the pretty things on the way there. When it's time to go back home you play games where the horses were cared for. If seagoing cowboys were still around I would love to be one so badly. It would be so cool if I could be one too.

In conclusion, all i'm saying is that the seagoing cowboys would be something worth doing and worth while. You can go so many places and you rarely go to the same place ever. It sounds so cool and you never know where you'll go, hey you might just go to Egypt and see the pyrimids you just never know.",2,6,0.8795061111450195
1eab2e8,"Do you love going to foreign places, taking care of animals, making new friends, or just having fun? If you said yes to any of these things, then you should be part of the Seagoing Cowboys program. A Seagoing Cowboy is someone who takes care of horses, young cows, and mules while they are shipped over seas to places like Europe and China. You don't just have to take care of animals though.

On the trek over to Europe and back to America you never work all day and all night. You have shifts that you share with multiple other Seagoing Cowboys, and while you are on break, you can play games. To help pass time, we usually play baseball and volleyball games. We also host table-tennis tournaments. Some people even read, whittle, fence, and box. There is never a dull moment on board of our ship.

Once you unload the cattle, mules, and horses, you don't just go right back on the boat to America either. You can go and sightsee! I had the benefit of seeing the Acropolis in Greece, and got to ride a gondala in Venice, Italy. I got to do other things too such as take a tour of an exavated castle in Crete, and see the Panama Canal on my way to China!

On top of that, you become very close friends with the people on board of your boat. After all you are on the boat with them from a month to a little over two months. So, you guys will become great friends from playing baseball with them in your free time, or just because you have to share chores with them. Also, if you're an animal lover, you get to take care of the animals too!

Finally, a benefit of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is you learn a lot too. You learn how to brave the storm of the harsh sea and how to take care of other people in need. It made me more aware of other people's needs and how to take care of them when they need help. Therefore, if you want to have fun, love sightseeing and animals, and want to make new friends, then becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is for you. Come and join us!   ",4,6,0.8619948029518127

Another reason Luke would try to convince you to join is because you could be helping people and countries by taking care of animals, such as horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke would also tell people to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you could visit new places you have never been to before, like Europe or China, or Greece and Italy. Luke had the chance of visiting these four places because he was part of the Seagoing Cowboys, and you get to cross oceans, like the Atlantic and Pacific.

Another reason luke would tell you to join the program would be because you would always be busy. The animals all needed food and water two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats ave to be pulled up from the lower level. And their stalls have to be cleaned.

Luke would also tell you to be careful if you joined the Seagoing Cowboys. On Luke's second trip, he almost fell into the dark waters of the Atlantic. He served as a watchman, and he would have to check on the animals every hour. And one rainy night, when he was going to report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. But luckily, a small strip of metal along the edge stopped him from sliding towrad the the dark Atlantic, and kept him aboard the ship. Luke was happ he was alive, but he had to take a couple of days off of work because he cracked his ribs.

But you can also have fun on the ship, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They would play baseball or volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped time go by faster.

Being part of a Seagoing Cowboy can be a great expierience, and it was for Luke Bombergur. It opened the world to him. He said he was grateful for the opportunity of being part of the program. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That's why you should be part of the Seagoing Cowboys. It will give you great memories that will stay with you. It will give you life expierience that you might need later on in your life. It will give chances to visit new places you might love and never forget about. It will give you a chance of helping people and countries around the world. It will give you a chance to meet new people and to get to know them well. It will give you all of this and much, much more. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

20d9bb9,"Luke had a really great time when he was with the UNRRA, and he almost did it for free, and chances are if he did you can to. You almost do it for free, you can have a fun time, you get to go to a lot of neat places, you don't have to be 18 to join, you get experience with animals, and best of all you don't have to have much experience.

First thing's first, you don't have to use big bucks to join, you really just have to sign up and hope for the best. In the story Luke didn't know much about it but he still couldn't turn the opportunity down.

Secondly, you would have a lot of fun. You'd get to play basketball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, and boxing in the empty holds where the animals used to be to help pass time on your way back.

Thirdly, you got to go to a lot of neat places. When you got to your destination you have to do something, so why not go site seeing. For example, if you were going to Rome, go see the Colosseum or see the Acropolis in Greece.

Fourthly, you don't have to be 18 to join. You can be 17, or 16 but I'm pretty sure you have to graduate highschool before you can join.

Fithly, you get experience with animals. On Luke's first trip, he had 335 horses and you could have also had cattle as well.

Sixthly, you don't have to have much experience with animals or with water. You just have to be on guard because anything can happen.

Lastly, you would be helping others and yourself because you are becoming more responsable and you are giving back to people who need it most.

In conclosion, you should really join the UNRRA today and make a difference in not just your neighborhood but also around the world.",3,6,0.6099433898925781

There are many reasons to join the UNRRA. You get to help other people by giving them what they need to survive. You can by giving them food, clothing, and shelter. When you help other people with their needs, you get to go to other countries that you might have only heard about or not even heard of at all. When you bring people what the need to survive, you can see the joy on their faces. Seeing joy in others is a warm and inviting feeling. You can go sightseeing and go visiting very, very important places. I have been to many important places and landmarks, and so can you if you join. If you have dreamed about crossing oceans and helping others, then this is a job for you.

When the feeling of boredom strikes you if you have been on the boat for a long time, you have the chance to get to know your shipmates better and make friends. There also may be games to play on board like baseball and volleyball in empty stalls where the animals once were. There is table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling; which is carving things into blocks of wood and various other games. If you love taking care of animals, then you might be good at this job. There are many other jobs on board the ship. There is the opportunity to learn about your shipmates, learn what other countries and other people need, and there is also the opportunity to mature.

All of these things I have learned or done while on this job and trip around the world helping others. This is your chance to join the UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) or become a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" today. We need you now! ",3,6,0.6692525744438171

""Hey, Luke,"" says Mort and Jake.

They say,""Uh, we have something to tell you. We aren't joining the UNRRA.""

I say,""What? How come you don't want to join the UNRRA?""

Jake says,""Well, I'm sort of afraid of oceans or lands of water.""

""No need to worry about that,"" I say,""You would be distracted by all the amazing places we get to see such as how I got to see Crete and I got to see the Panama Canal.""

""Oh really?"" says Jake,""I've never knew that, thanks for telling me. I might join the UNRRA, now.

""Would't you be on the ship all the time? I want to have some sort of fun while i'm on the ship,"" says Mort.

I say,""No need to worry about that, Mort. We do a lot of things to past time on the boat.""

Mort says,""Really? What do you guys do?""

I say,""Well, there's Table-Tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, Whittiling, and games to pass up the time.""

""Oh, that's all I wanted to know,"" Mort says.

I say,""Now, are all of you convinced to join the UNRRA?""

Both Mort and Jake say,""oh, yes we are!""

So, as you can see, convincing friends to do something can be hard at times. Sometimes, you just have to have the facts to come with you. I'm very glad I signed up for the UNRRA in the past because is I didnt, I problaby wouldn't have been able to convince them to come. ",3,6,0.5461080074310303

If the answer is no to the first three questions and yes to the two other questions, then the Seagoing Cowboys program is for you. It is fun and educational for any one at any age. It is an amazing chance to get into this program and visit the unique places on the way to the adventure.

This is an amazing adventure I have been on it I have seen so many places and met many amazing people on the way. While I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I made nine trips it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy it was great. I saw so many amazing places I thought I would never be able to see because I was just a normal person in my town. I saw Europe and China while I was in the program it was a great experience for me as a almost adult. I also had the advantage of taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, it was the city with the streets of water. I also had a awesome chance at touring the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China in the Seagoing trip. You should join it so you can see all those amazing places I just stated to you that I have seen because of this amazing experience in the Seagoing Cowboys. Another reason you should join it is because if you are almost 18 and you do not want to get military drafted then join this, they count it as your service or they did for me which means they will for you. Another one is after the animals get dropped off and we are going back with no animals we get to play amazing games in the stalls that the animals were in like baseball and volleyball, we also played table-tennis tournaments or even boxing.

These are all the amazing things i got to do and see, you could see and do them to if you join Seagoing Cowboys.

Did you love the idea of these things? Do you want to be apart of these things? Do you wanna be a Seagoing Cowboy? These are only some of the amazing things I got to see and do while I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program. You could do them to you just have to join in on it.

You could stay home and care for your family or join the army."" The crowd then started to move back and no one wanted to sign up. I was not giving up this easy we needed more help.

I then shout their is plenty of exictment. Also "" The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy."" I got to see Europe and China. When you get to a new coutry you have some down time to explore. Also listen to this "" The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been."" Then the man shouted again "" Do you really think playing were animals pooped and peed and who knows what would be fun?"" Everyone backed off again.

We then kept shouting till a few people joined. I could not get everyone to join because of the young man but a handfill was good enough. To end it all i said ' I'm greatful for the opportunity."" "" It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

Of course it could be dangerous at sometimes because once on a rainy night I slipped and almost fell off board!

I was so happy I was still alive,the bad part was that I could'nt work for a couple of days because i cracked my ribs.

Also,you would help needy people that are in need food or water during your trip.

Firstly,you would have to learn how to take care of the animals on the boat. Seagoing Cowboys take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. The animals would have to be fed and watered three times a day. You would also have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. Personally, I love taking care of all the animals on the ship because they are very nice and friendly.

Next, another great thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is you can travel to many different parts of countries. For example, I had made nine trips to distinct countries. While you are in these places, you`ll get to have free time and explore the villages better. One of my favorite places that I got a chance to go to was in Crete where I toured an excavated castle on my way to China. You might also get to got to exciting places like this if you apply for the job.

Lastly, during your free time on the trip, you might want to stop by and help the people that are on the streets in need of food or water. If you have any extra food on the ship, you can donate it to the hungry. Doing this made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.",3,6,0.8353407382965088

What a watchman does is check the animals every hour after making the report to the captain Luke slipped on a slippery ladder on his back.

Wooster headed for Greece. On the ship were a 335 horse cargo with hay and oats to feed them. In paragraph 4 we learn that Luke turned 18 before he made it to Greece. This meant he was able to be drafted for military service, but his draft board said that he should just keep the service he already had. Luke was discharged in 1947, but he had made nine trips by that time, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Not only did Luke help people, but he also got to see Europe and China. Paragraph 5 tells us how Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece and how he take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

First, you need to be trained if u are not trained then why would you even go in the first place. You need to stay fit, u need to be able to survie with out food incase you run out or run out of water. Helping out on his aunts farm helped him get in shape and prepared for a real adventure.

But he could not work for a while because he broke one of his ribs.

Next, he did not just go to help people even know that was his main priorty. he also went to see all thease beaituful places the would have been arriving to.

Then, they would still have fun on board it is not as bad as u think. You still get to play baseball and volleyball games where all the animals had been staying will they were on board. They played thease games to pass time, table - tennis tourmants, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

last, of all the cattle boat trips, were unbelievable opportiny for a small - town boy he says. Beside helping people getting to travel areound the world it was just brethtaking. Most of his trips were a susses I enjoyed the trips and can't wait for more.

If it weren't for the Seagoing Cowboys Program, I wouldn't have visited half of the places I have in my whole entire life. While on the job, I had time to visit Greece, Italy, China, Crete, and many other countries. I even got to sail the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean 2 times!

Another reason that you should join is the amazing experiance you'll gain. When I first joined, I had a tiny bit of experiance with animals from helping out at my Aunt Katie's farm. But even if you don't have a little bit of a backround with helping out animals, you'll have all of the knowledge you'll need just by taking one trip. Being in the Seagoing Cowboys program also taught me about all of the dangers there are at sea.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is the fun you get to have. Yes, you do have to work hard and still get the job done correctly. But after the job has been completed, you can play games with the other cowboys. For instance, I used to play a lot of baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Other stuff that helped pass the time were table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Now that you've read why I recommend you join the Seagoing Cowboys program, (especially for the places you go, experiance you gain, and fun you get to have) I hope that you will consider my point. It really cahanged me for the better, and I thing it will change you, too.",3,6,0.8940724730491638

Lucks friend Don Reist invited him to toto Europe on a cattle boat. Luke said yes, and began a whole new adventure. You know that a cattle boat is not as bad as it sounds. You should tell yourself should I.

Here are a few reasons why you should consider going.

<It would be a lot of fun

< You love trying new things

<You also like adventure,and trust this is a chance of a life time at least Luke thinks so.

You should remember that these are only a few reasons to try there are tons of more were that came from. I would tell you,but I'm kinda in the middle of taking a HUGE test. I don't wanna spend my time doing that. I want you to at least consider it. I think you could be the best cowboy or cowgirl who rides the waves ever.

This is my conclusion I really hope I have convinced you to try riding the waves if I haven't at least try new things,and never stop be leaving that you can't. You have the world to explore. You are an adventurer,and I can't wait to explore what cool things you can do to like our amazing world.

First,the trips was an amazing opportunity for a small town boy.I had the side benefit of seeing china and Europe. Even some places I never heard about its so wonderful.When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip,they told me to just keep doing that for my service .By the time i was discharged in 1947,Then I had made nine trips,the most of any seagoing cowboy.It took about two weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept me busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Last,but being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up the world to me,im grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.         ",2,6,0.8576364517211914

It is a very good experiance to go seagoing. You get to see a lot of different places and meet different people with different life styles. Sometimes it is weird hearing them talk, but sometimes it can be funny. The people also ask about our country. They wonder about the people, food, and animals that we have. They also wonder what our houses look like.

I think you should go seagoing because it's like nothing else. Traviling the sea, and seeing the water as the sun sets. It's like nothing else. I also love the sound of the ocean. It calms me when I miss home. But sometimes, the ship feels like home.

I very much wish so that you will go seagoing, because it's the best thing you will ever do. If it doesn't interest you thats ok. There are millions of other things to do. Maybe it's just not for you. But for me, it's just right.      ",2,6,0.6229514479637146

Luke wasted his life being a Seagoing Cowboy."" well they're wrong. Luke got to see so many amazing things on his way home alothough taking care of cattle and almost fallingnover i might have considered it to. What luke did was amazing helping countries get pieced together again after the war by taking cattle from one place to another. Luke said ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable for a small town boy."" i bet they were!

You might be saying why would i waste years of my life for this? Well I say they're not wasted! Going on trips for free doing some minor work is better than staying at home eating potato chips with some doctor pepper watching who knows what like the Oprah show or somthing. I would go on the trips for the thrill of it plus i've never been out of North America so that would be fun. Oh what is that your saying? You dont like leaving your home? Well get a house boat for the cattle then you can ride withc the cattle and have modern day comforts. What now? House boats are to expensive? Then tie ballons to your house like Carl did in Up. I know I know helium and ballons are expensive. What is that? You hate traveling? Well if so why are you even reading this im trying to argue why its good to be a cattle-boater. So i came up with the perfect sollution! Buy a horse,a cow,a goat, and a boat and. BAM! You have a cattle-boat. What now? You get sea-sick well take a bag because this is a good job and im sure it pays good, because you know on a boat with stinky animals. All you'd have to do is clean thier pens give them food and water and i'm sure bathe them. See? Simple job. Besides like Luke had an opurtunity of a life time getting to see so many places. What now? Oh you dont like the ocean well then...

Buy a pool and let your imagination play out. It's not that hard right? Why would you argue about a job when you can: A. See the world, B. Do little work, and C.Help others.

You will miss out on so many fun adventures and other peoples lifes and countries if you don't join the program.

If you join the program then you will have so much fun with all the different places and adventures. One of the people who come here, named Luke has been to so many beautiful places. Luke has made nine trips, more than any member in the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke has toured an excavated castle in Crete and went to the Panama canal on his way to China.

If it wasn't for Luke's friend, Don Reist,he would have never been a member and he would have never seen any of these places that he has been to. Luke knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime. At the time Luke joined, World war 2 was over in Europe. Many countries were ruined and needed help, so Don and Luke joined to go on a mission to go to other countries that were ruined to help the countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more.

""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. Luke has gotten hurt for other people, because he knew that what was going on in their lifes,are far worse than his. He has traveled alot and seen alot that has happend in other countries, and they need more people to save them.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That awareness stayed with him throughout his life. He lead his family and international students and exchanged visitors for many years.

Then the reason Luke started to work with the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" because he wanted to help the people with their cattles, horses, and mules. Also to help countries recover their food supples, animals, and more, 44 nations joined to help to form UNRRA. Luke also join to travel across the ocean and se new places too.

Then Luke work hard to feed the cattle, horses, and mules twice or three times a day, Luke started to work hard by bring up bales of hay and bring bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship to feed the cattle, horses, and mules everyday, and cleaning the stalls for the aniamls to comfortable when the animals are on the ship. Then on one rainy night after Luke made his hour report to the captain. He slipped on the leader and landed on his backside, but he was stopped by a small strip of metal on the edge to keep him from flying overboard. Luke broke his ribs and could not work for a couple days to his engary.

In conclusion Luke and other people had a hard life during the year that they had, but they still had a good life during the year with their families and friend that are there to support you no matter what happenes during those year they had together.Also you should always work hard to complete your goals in life like Luke did in the story.

That is why you should prepare for the dangers.

The main part of being a seagoing cowboy is to help people, not hurt them. If you hurt them that means you didn't care about others and you didn't want to help them.

My friend, Don, and I signed up. I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you could save a life.

The Seagoing Cowboys help people in need, especially after World War ll, it feels so nice to help people in need, if you sign up you could feel it, too. Since we ship animals and take care of them around the world, we provide people with good livestock, that maybe, could save a life! And, if you're bored, the animals keep you busy. Also, there is some incredible sightseeing around the world.

Another reason you would want to sign for the Seagoing Cowboys program is you could see some truly, incredible things! Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China! I saw some beautiful things like, the Acropolis in Greece, taking the gondola ride in Italy, that has streets of water, I toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I loved the Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. That may be beautiful, but if you still aren't convinced, the danger that it puts in your life makes your heart pump!

My third reason, is the danger and heart-skipping-a-beat experiences that this program gives you! If you're bored with your life, think about the Seagoing Cowboys program. The reason I say this, is one rainy night, after I made my hourly report to my captain, I suddenly slid down a slippery ladder on my back. I would've fell off, if it wasn't for a strip of metal that caught me! I would have been in the deep water of the Atlantic by now. I felt happy to be alive, and I will never forget that moment.

My last reason is that I had so much fun, and it was a truly amazing, never-forgetting experience. On return trips we played games in the hold where the animals were. We played baseball, volleyball, and other games like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and more, that got us ready for our next adventure. This program gave me a better-than-amazing experience, and I would love to share it with you!

Now, I should conclude my thoughts. You should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys so you could help people in need, see amazing things, such as the Acropolis in Greece, so you can have a dangerous but amazing life, and so you can have fun and have a never forgetting experience. Sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys, now!

First, it helps the world by in 1945 World War II, was being taken over by Europe and Europe made so many countries leave the ruins and it was just not right for people to move out of their countries. So 44 nations formed a group called the,"" UNRRA which meant (the United Nations Relief and Rehailitation Adminstration.)

Then, save the people and animals by UNRRA had hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young cows, horses, and mules that had been shiped overseas. That is when Luke and Don had signed up. So after they had signed up in August 1945, they had got a orders to report to New Orleans. When Luke and Don arrived on August 14 Luke had said,"" The day the Pacific war ended."" Everyone got their seaman's papers and boarded that had SS Charles W. Wooster, headed to Greece with a cargo of horses and enough hay to eat So I think that if more people sign up more animals and people will be saved.

Site seeing in these places are memorial you will never forget them. This is just one of the benefits of helping others.

""I don't like the sea air"", ""I hate the ocean"", "" I can't swim"", ""What we get tropedoed? I can't swim"", I have allergies to horses"". These are exuses I get when I try to convince other people to join the progam I am in. I did convince some, but not a lot. Most think that I am a creep. They try to get away from me. I am always sad when I see them walk away, but at least I tried. Eventuly I gave up trying to convince them.

So here I am, on the sea, thinking about the people that I tried to get them to join. Every time that I thought about them, I think about what they are doing right now. When I was discharged, I went off to find every single one of the people and tell about my journys. They always say the same thing. ""I wish I joined the program."" Then we have a good talk about what they did while I was overseas. I feel like that I have more friends than I used to before.",1,6,0.644689679145813
26b13f6,"I think that boys should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Because during this trip you get to go place that you have never been before, take care of animals, and not only work but you get to play games and sports.

One thing that I did on my aventure was I went and saw Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and Marvled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys half to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Once I had to get on the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

Plus in the spare time the cowboys (us) played baseball and vollyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the other games also helped pass the time.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an aventure.

But it opened up the world to me.

I'm so grateful for the opportunit, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. The awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years.

All of the things that I got to see, do, and play you could to. But the most important thing is that if you join the program then you get to help with things that are important. So what do you say will you join? Or will you stay at home and not help and see the world like I did? But just so you know this is a once and a life time experience.

26c61e1,"I'm going to tell you why you sould participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.I am hoing to include the animals, the traviling and the fun you can have while being a Seagoing Cowboy.

First im going to talk about the animals, us as cowboys love animals, and with this program you can do your thing by taking care of tha animals. People would really apretriate your work as well they would be happy that you are helping take care of the animals. It may be hard work but it is worth it. So thats one reason to join.

The second thing that is the traviling. You get to go to deffirent places and see new things you don't always get to see. You could go to London, China, Russia and lots more just from joining this wonderful program. You might never go and see these wonderful places in your life if you don't join. I think that is the best part about being apart of this program.

Finly I'm going to talk about the fun you could have in this program. In your free time the crew will play baseball and Volleyball and much more. It is not only fun but it passes time and you won't be bored. You can make lots of new and cool friends as well.

So see? This program is something worth joining. It may be dangorous but there are more Pros than Cons in this situation and i really think you will enjoy it. Well these are the reasons I'm here and this place is great you should join. WE could all have a great time.",3,6,0.8411082029342651
2720b3c,"First, while I was on the boat with the Seagoing Cowboys, we had many things to do. One of them was that when the animals were off the ship we played baseball. The ship was big enough for it which was great for us. When the animals were on we learned new things about the animals. The male horses were the hardest to feed. They always kicked, but the females were nice and gentle while I feed them.

Next, when we went to China I saw so many cool buildings. Even some that have not even been seen no where else. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece. That was a great thing to see. In Venice, Italy I took no a gondola ride though the city with streets of water. I never saw anything so beautiful in my life.

Then, what I learned on this trip was that helping others that lost something in a war is pretty fun. I got to learn new lauguage and what they ate before everything was taken from them. Doing this will help u see how hard it can be when a we come and you never know that one of the days you live you will feel how they felt when they lost food and a home and even loved ones. Doing this your becoming a better person and people will look up to you for that.

Last, with the honor to do this wonderful thing I became a honorable person. Even though something like this can change things and the way people look at me. I was just a average boy until I went to the Seagoing Cowboys which changed how I even looked at people and myself. Doing this program will change your life and teach people how to be a great person.",3,6,0.6535192728042603
274349c,"Today we will be talking about the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" So sit back in your chair, and prepare to get lost your mind. Veiwer beware you might just learn somthing new.

In this paragraph will be talking about the young man on his way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why he did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for himself. No he did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why he did it to help those women, men, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins.

In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in.

For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas. We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures. Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China.

In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that he tried to help people. He was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop him form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe his charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call him this and simply this human.",3,6,0.5448516607284546

We are going to deliver animals to the countries in need. The first animal we are going to give them is a cow for milk and if needed meat. We are going to give them mules so that they can carry heavy things around. We are also going to give them horses so that they can ride them to places so that they do not have to walk far distances on land if they don't have a boat and can't travel far distances on a boat down a river.

You might not want to do it because of being on the ship, but you can still have fun while on the ship. While on board you have a good time to enjoy playing games and doing your hobbies, here are some, table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading, and whittling.

When you're on the ship your demeanor will change right when you see the marvelouse sights. I had the experience of touring the excavated castle in Crete, seeing Europe and China, and marveling at the Panama Canal while on my way to China. As you arrive at where you are going, something to give you reassurance is knowing that you are doing something good. You are helping people rebuild and recover what they had lost. I had the I'm-on-top-of-the-world feeling as soon as I knew I was helping them get back what they had lost, and I think you will too. This chance is big for you.

''Boom!'' You think in your mind as you look back at the distruction from the war and bombs. That melancholy feeling you get as you see all that has went on will change as you think of why you are there, and what you are doing. I know that you should join this program because it is a once-in-a-life-time chance. You will have fun as I did in my exuberant experience in this program.

europe and china because they just got done with war. The animals will help produce food. So I hope farmers or anybody that knows how to take care of animals join the program.

Details from the story to help support my anwser is they take care of the animals every hour. They also have to be on a boat for two weeks or more. I also know that It Is not a easy job sometimes you get to play games but it is still dangerous. It is dangerous because in the story he almost slide of the boat and whent in the ocean but he luckely hit a pole to stop him. The bad thing is he broke his ribs.

My conclusion for this essay is that if you are on the boat you will have a little bond with the animals. I also know that you are doing a good thing helping europe and china. It makes you look like a good person and you care about the contries and animals. In the story It also said that there was water on the roads.

You should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program because. You get to learn about so many animals. You get to know how much they eat, and what they eat. As stated in paragraph six it says. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Another reason you should try this program is because it is very big opporuntinity. You get to see the world. You get to know what it is like at sea. Maybe you might like it. And decide that you want to do it for a living on your own ship. It says in paragraph nine. ""Im grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs.""

My last reason is that you may be able to learn what other countries are like. Would'nt you like to go explore the world? See what it is like in other places. My stated can be supported by paragraph five. It states in the paragraph. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

You should become a sea going cowboy with me becase. After we leave the animals to where they belong the trip back is verry interesting. We play baseball and vollyball games where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, Whittling, and games helpes pass the time. This is much more than an adventure this opened up the world to me.

Being a seagoing cowboy is much more than the fun. Helping these animals makes me feel that I did something good for others, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. This makes me feel so a complished with myself. I know I did a good deed and that makes me happy.

You also get to visit so many places. I got to visit Europe that is were my seagoing cowboy expirience started. I also went to Greece, China Venice, Italy,a city with streets of water. It took me two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean. I remeber on trip I was watch man for the night it was pretty cool if you ask me.

Don and I went over to Europe and many other countries and noticed they were left in ruins. Both of us signed up. Don and I did what we could to help out over in Europe and the many other countries in poverty after the war.

Here are some reasons that I think you should join. You get to help lots of animals, mostly cattle. Don and I got our seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster. We ended up with a cargo of 335 horses plus we had enough hay and oats to feed them. Caring for the animals kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Sightseeing was a huge plus for me. We went to Europe and China. My favorite place we visited was seeing the Acropolis in Greece. We rode a gondola in Venice, Italy. Did you know they have a excavated castle in Crete?

The last thing we saw was the Panama Canal in China.

It wasn't all serious work, we also got to have fun. Don and I played games to pass time. We played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and many others. I'm grateful for the opportunity and that I took it. It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier need, instead of focusing on my needs or other people focusing on their needs.

You also get to go to different countrys that you have never seen before. If you are up for a challenge and you want to change the world, join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Tons of people have join this program and it has changed their lives. For example, Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist joined this program right after World War ll was over. They joined because they wanted to make a difference and help people that were in need. They had a lifetime experience. They got to travel across the Alantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people that were affected by World War ll.

These games are played when you return on trips after the animlas have been unloaded. They also have tournaments like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whitling, and other games that heled pass time. In the empty holds they would have big baseball and volleyball games.

This job is fun but you also nhave to look at the dangerous side. Luke Bomberger, on his second trip, served as a night watchman. His job was to check on all the animas every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide. This program is very dangerous but very fun at the same time. You have to be aware on this job but still have fun at the same time.

It also helps the people in different countries that need someone to help them with their life. This job as dagerous setting but is also really challegeing and fun at the same time.

Luke got to travle the world while takeing care of the animals they were transporting. Luke traveled 9 times. That's more than most Seagoing Cowboys. Luke got to see Greece, Europe, and China. He travled across the Pacific and the Atlantic ocean while working as a Seagoing Cowboy.

He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and at a bank when his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no he knew it would be an opportunity for him. It was 1945,world war 2 was over in Europe and countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover 44 nations came together and started UNRRA {The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration}. UNRRA hired seagoimg cowboys to take care of the horses,young cows, and the mules.

The first reason to join the program is because they came together and started a group of 44 nations to help Europe. They hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to help the animals. They are trying to get the nation back together. Luke and Don signed up for it to. Heading over seas in August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived ''August 14,'' Luke sayed,the day the Pacific war ended.''

The second reason you should join the group is because '' The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' he said.''Besides helping people, had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,'' he says. ''So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water.'' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china.

The third reason why you should join the group is cause caring for the animals during the crossings kept luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hayand bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work.

In conclusion I think you can still help with or without an reward.

While the last few things I said may have made you a little uncertain about joining, don't worry. The good things completely overshodow the downsides. First, just seeing the smiles of the people you help warm your heart. Also, you grow bonds like no other with your fellow cowboys.

2975d96,"Many people give up their lives and time to become a seagoing cowboy. Luke was one of those people who did this. Many people who join this program wanted to help people by not joing the military so they joined this program. These people helped countries with problems after wars. There are lots of reasosns to join the UNRRA program.

Another reason to join the seagoing cowboys is you get to help people while traveling. You get to see so many things that you probably wouldn't have seen if you were not a seagoing cowboy or memeber on UNRRA. Many people did this after World War II ended in Europe. The text states ""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins."" and

""In August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. 'We arrived August 14,' Luke says, 'the day the Pacific war ended.'""

Luke and his friend had to go over seas the day a war on the water ended.

Sure there are dangers of being a seagoing cowboy, but many countries and people are helped. People join not just for travel, but to help others. Many countries are helped do to the UNRRA program. Many countries get food, shelter, and clothes taken away to help military during war. The UNRRA helps these people get these things back. The text states ""'It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.'"" and ""UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)."" ",2,6,0.8229846954345703

In this program you get to see so many unique and beautiful places. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece which was very special. I also got to see a couple more which are, Panama Canal in china, and a excavated castle in Crete. I think anybody would want to see those places. As you see these you will never forget and make great memories like I did.

Also in this program you get to travel to so many marvoules places. I got to go across the Atlantic Ocean 16 times! Thats crazy! I also went across the Pacific Ocean twice. I also got to go to some different countrys. Right before I turned Eight teen I went to Greece. I also got to see Europe and China. Guess what, I went to even more places! I got to go to Venice, Italy and Crete to. This is a great program for you if you like traveling.

Finally there are so many oppertunities in the Seagoing Cowboys program. You get to see so many places, and see things so many things, and do things you never thought you would as a little kid.

297885d,"A Seagoing Cowboy is not always the easiest job. Although there are the dangers of the sea, it is a wonderfull chace for someone to see Europe and China. One can also make some new friends or peers.

When aboard any ship or boat, there is a danger of storms or wind. Even just sliding off the boat. One always has a crew behind him or her to watch out for them. No one ever has to fear being badly hurt.

True friends wouldn't let their friends fall off a boat. When they see them start to trip they would come running to see that they don't go overboard. On the boat one learns to trust others about what to do, where to go, and especially how to do something. The best part is that the cowboys that have been on the ships before can tell where the best tourist places are.

When a person gets on the boat they are stepping into an adventure. While one is on the boat it travels to Europe, China, and other lovely places. These may be places that one has never seen before. In that instance the trip would be even more breath taking and exiting.

Although there are a few dangers of the sea, being a seagoing cowboy is a lovely chance for sight seeing and new friends. When you go out to sea there are great opportunities for adventure. One will never really know untill they see for themselves.     ",3,6,0.7771097421646118

Luke Bomberger had two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. One day, his friend, Don Reist, invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. To help countries in need to get food supplies, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and they hired ""sea cowboys"" to help countries in need. It was 1945 and the end of World War II in Europe when Luke and Don signed up to become a sea cowboy.

In August 1945, Luke and Don received orders to get a boat in New Orleans. They boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece. On the way, Luke turned 18, which ment he could be drafted for military service. When the military found out that Luke was a sea cowboy, they decided to let him do that for service. Luke went many places such as Greece, Crete, Panama, and Italy. He spent the rest of his life at his home.

Sea cowboys get to go lots of places, according to the text above. Luke went to places such as Panama and Italy. Why don't you sign up to be a sea cowboy? Sea cowboys get to travel the seas and see different places. Sea cowboys help people. Sea cowboys travel. I don't see why you shouldn't become a sea cowboy.

Sea cowboys helped many people in the 1940's. Luke Bomberger traveled many places and helped many people. He is a legend among the sea cowboys. Sea cowboys got to see many places and different countries. Sea cowboys helped the military. Sea cowboys got to go down the Panama canal and ride on boats through the canals in Italy.

I got invited to the Seagoing Cowboys Program by my friend Don Reist.

At the time i was working two part-time jobs. I knew that this was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime so obviously i accepted Don's invitation.

We got our first orders in August 1945 to report to new orleans.

We were smooth sailing from that point on.

As i was on the ships i learned a lot of valueable lessons.

Being on the Seagoing Cowboys program was such a blessing and it had quite a few perks.

We got to visit a lot of cool and different places around the world.

Not only did we get to visit them we also got to learn a few things about them.

Being on the Seagoing Cowboy progams is not just all fun and games it is also a lot or hardwork.

Feeding and taking care of the animals is real hardwork. In the article is says "" Caring for the animals in the crossings kept me busy.""

This was very true because the work kept you very tired.

All things have to come to a end though.

When we finally did drop off the animals and all thier food and supplies we got to have a little fun.

After the animals were unloaded us cowboys got to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds were the animlas were being housed. I think if your a hardworker your sure to do just fine in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you do go and become in the Seagoing Cowboys program a good peice of advice is to watch your step because some nights the ships tend to get a little slippery.",2,6,0.8450901508331299

We travel to amazing places! We once went to China and I just adored the Panama Canal. We went to Venice, Italy and went on a gondola ride it was beautiful. When we went to Greece, the Acropolis was the grandest thing I have ever saw! So if you like to travel why don't you just travel with the Seagoing Cowboys.

We also play games on the long trips. we play baseball and volleyball in the animals old holding rooms. We also do fencing, table-tennis, reading, and even more fun sports. So if you want to play sports, read, and even more come join the Seagoing Cowboys.

We also care for animals that are being shipped overseas. We care for young cows, horses, mules, and even more animals. We once had a cargo of 335 horses but we had enough hay and oats to feed them and we traveled from New Orleans to Greece. So if you enjoy caring for animals you should join us and help us care for them.

Do these things interest you in any way?

So if you love animals, playing sports, and travel you would be perfect for the Seagoing Cowboys. When I became a Seagoing Cowboy so many new oppertunities opened in my life, so if you want new oppertunities in your life you should sign up and join.",3,6,0.8566734790802002

These trips might be half-year long trips, but the trips are life-changing experiences. I'll show you reasons why to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. These reasons are coming from a person who has joined the Seagoing Cowboys and served for three years.

The first reason is because of the experience you'll gain from the trips. The trips are life-changing. You have the benefits of traveling the world. You get to see and do a lot of things an average person wouldn't do. You get to see Europe, China, and Greece, and many other beautiful places. You might even take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy or pass the Panama Canal. The experience is an amazing one.

These trips can cheer you up. Like I said before, you get to travel to amazing places and do amazing things. These might sound like fun things to do, because they are. You might ask how you have fun while on the ship in the sea. You can play table-tennis, fencing, boxing, baseball, volleyball, or any other games that helped pass time. You have a lot of fun during the trips. At the same time, you're helping peope and other countries and serving as military service.

Last but not least, you are more aware of the world. The trips open the world up to you. You're more aware of people of other countries and their needs. This awareness can change your life.

All in all, the Seagoing Cowboys is a great program to join. It's an opportunity of a lifetime. On these trips, you're gaining experience. You're visiting a lot of places and having a lot of fun.

2a4b0b5,"I think that from Luke's point of view it looks like a great experience and it would be an opportunity of a lifetime to be a Seagoing Cowboy. By being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to travel and see many amazing places and meet so many types of people. Also if you like animals you are in luck because you get to take care of them while your on the boat sailing across the sea. Another thing you might get to do is have your birthday some awesome like Luke did in Greece. In the following pharagraph I am going to be telling you some things about being a Seagoing Cowboy like what it's like to take care of the cattle, some amazing places that you might visit ,and how you must be careful while board the ship.

By being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to do so many things and experience them. One huge thing that you would have to be willing to do is take care of all of the animals on the ship sailing with you like young cows, horses, and mules. Like Luke the animals on the ship would keep you busy, you would have to feed them and give them water at least three times a day, pull bales of hay and bags of oats out from lower holds of the ship, and clean out the stalls. Also you would get to go to many amazing places around the world like Luke did. You might get to go to places like Europe and China and see Acropolis in Greece, and maybe take a gondola ride in Venice, and see Italy the city with streets of water. You would also have to be careful while board the ship. One night Luke slipped down some stairs and almost went over board, and because of this he cracked a couple of ribs and had to take a break off the job. It would be quite an adventure to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Now that I have told you some thrilling things about be a Seagoing Cowboy what do you think? I think it would be so much fun to sail acrossed the world while taking care of animals and going to all kinds of places. It would be so exciting, but it would also make me nervous because when Luke Bomberger was a Seagoing cowboy he almost went over board. I think that by being a Seagoing Cowboy it would open up the world to you and how you thought of the world just like it did to Luke Bomberger who was an amzing Seagoing Cowboy. So know that I told you what I think it would be like from Luke's point of veiw I hope that I encourage you to want to being a Seagoing Cowboy.",3,6,0.8326749801635742

And that is because we bring people food livestock and make the hard time's easier for them because everyone want's to be treated the same so do it and help. But if youre a person who want's to do work to be rewarded then you still might want to help we get to go over sea's and see a bunch of exotic animal's elsewhere plus vacation spot's like touring a excavated castle or see the panamal canal and taking a gondola ride in Venice Italy. But the price is not paying a bunch of money but doing a little bit of work and on board you can do thing's like volleyball reading and ping-pong championship's.

But like I said I can see where someone else might come from because the work isn't alway's easy like feeding the animal's an watering them alot cleaning out the stall's but like I said everything has it's ups and downs and turn around's and some people would enjoy my work.

Paragraph nine also states that Luke said ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys you would be sure to highly to enjoy it! Here are a few reasons about why you might reconsider your thoughts.

Luke was just an ordinary boy who was working two jobs. In paragraph one it states that Luke's friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Paragraph one also stated that Luke couldn't pass up the offer becasue it was an opportunity of a lifetime. In paragraph two it states that Luke and Don signed up to be apart of the Seagoing Cowboys. Because of Luke and Don signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys they got many opportunities to cross the seas.

Another reason why some of you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you could be a small-town boy or girl like Luke in paragraph five, and expirience many amazing opportunities if you just take the chance and say yes. If youn think that all you will do is stay on a boat and go somewhere and then leave, then get back on the boat and do the same thing you are wrong. In paragraph five Luke states ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" To a lot of people that is really cool because a lot of people woud love to vist China and Europe and have a great time.

Last but not least, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you would be surrounded with a ton of great people. In paragraph eight it states that Luke found time to have fun on board. It also states that the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games so it will be sure that you will have fun! But only if you join the Seagoing Cowboys because if you don't you will miss out on a lot of fun things other than just work. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is something you don't want to miss out on so you better come and sign up now!

That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it is a very big opportunity of a lifetime, something some people wouldn't want to miss out on.

So Luke Bomberger learned a lot from not ever going overseas before.

The Seagoing program is educational because according to Lukes adventure he learned a lot about taking care of animals, and learning that

""World War ll was over in Europe, and many other countries were left in ruins"".

So I could say that Luke probably was interested in many different things and he probably had fun learning them. According to the article it sounds like Luke was very anxiuos when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe with him on a cattle boat. When Don Reist invited him he kinda sounded like he was kinda confused when Don said cattle boat but then I think he thought that it would be a perfect opportunity to learn or see what is would be like.

You should go try the Seagoing program! It can be a very exciting experience if you have never tried it or even heard of it before. I also think you can learn many different events that havehappened overseas, such as visiting it to see what it looks likes if you live far or just seeing where World War ll was hield at. I also think it could be very interesting to just see what happened or if theres something there from World War ll. So you should go and visit Europ e on a cattle boat just to see how interesting or what you see that you dont see around where you live.   ",3,6,0.8158622980117798

I like that Luke had aggread to go on the trip and that he is engoing it after he broke his ribs because that means he has a good spirit. I did injoy this story and people shuld participate in the program.

Luke's participation in the progran hays allowed him to experince adventures and visits to many unique places. Such as when he saw the Acropolis in greesce was special. He also saw Europe and China. There took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke also saw Italy with streets of water.

Others should join the program because you get to travel around the world. Luke stated that he went to China and Europe! He traveled the Pacific and Atlantis ocean several times. He's been to Greece. If you like to travel, this would be a great program to join.

Luke feeds and waters the animals. Luke has to check on the animals every hour. I would join this program because I'm an animal person and I would love to spend weeks, maybe even months with these animals. Others who aren't animal people maybe shouldn't join this program. It would be a great way to interact with the animals if you don't like animals al that much.

Joining this program could teach you something. It could teach you many things. It could teach you to be more cautious about things.

This was my only chance to help out and go to another place, but if I would have said no then I would have never of gone to Europe and I would still be at home working to jobs and not being able to do much of anything but work and work and work. At my first trip I wasn't at Europe until after I was 18 when this happened I could draft myself for the U.S. army and would be able to do this all of the time. When they got my draft they told me to keep doing what I was doing. What I was doing was feeding the animals. Then on my second trip I was on nightlook out. Every hour I had to check on the animals and make sur ethat there was nothing wrong with them. After a while it started to rain and I slid down the metal ledder and I cracked my ribs. But the best thing about this was that I could make my mark on the world. This is why I think that you should join the seagoing Cowboys.",2,6,0.8200522661209106

Cowboy because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, as he says in paragraph one. Luke also wanted to help others who had been affected by World War ll.

Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and he loved to help the people.

Some people would probably refuse to go to another country that had just been through war some people would say it was to risky and unsafe well it is, some people might say that it is too dangerous to cross the ocean well it is but Luke felt that these were things that he needed to do and is something that is important to him.

Luke also got to visit many great places in between his journeys, he got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on his way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great.

But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there. Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney.

In conclusion Luke loves being a Seagoing Cowboy he loves all the sights, all the help that he can give to these other people, and that he could have this opportunity in life.                  ",3,6,0.6754298806190491

Here are some reasons to join the program, I think you should join the program because to help people in need. Also World War II just finished and if the people's family members died you could go comfort them. Another reason why is "" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. Also to go take care of hores, young cows, and mules that were shpped over seas.

Some of the claims are "" When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service."" "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.""When Luke was helping his aunt Katie when he was little it had prepared luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at the sea.

So the main point of this was to always help those in need because once you do kindness might come back to you like a boomerang. Also once when Luke was done his awareness stayed with him leading his family to host students and exchange visitors for many years.",2,6,0.6802505254745483

Soon enough you'll know everything there is to know about taking care of them like feeding, washing, grooming, and even playing with them. ""It's an oppurtunity of a lifetime.""

Not only do you get to take care of animals, you get to sight see as well. ""It's an unbelievable oppurtunity for a small-town boy"" says a cowboy named Luke ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says. So was taking a godola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Imagine seeing beautiful cities that you always wanted to see, right in front of your eyes.

And finally, when you join, you get to have fun. On board, especially on return trips after animals have been unloaded, the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. You can play table-tennis, fence, box, read, whittle, and other games to pass the time.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is more than an adventure, it opens the world to you. Luke says. ""I'm grate ful for the oppurtunity, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

2cc3fa2,"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys! In this program, we go on several adventures to different countries to help recover the food supplies, animals, and more. The UNRRA created the Seagoing Cowboys program to help recover the damages of World War II, which you can be one of the people to help!

If you think we barely go places, then you're wrong. I have sailed and ocean 18 times while being a Seagoing Cowboy! You might think it takes a massive time out of your life, but it really doesn't. To cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States took me only two weeks! Also, it only took a month to get to China! If you think it is boring, you are wrong once again. When we are sailing across the ocean, we play multiple games, such as baseball and volleyball!

This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I got to help others that have been effected by World War II. I also got to sail around and see other countries you have wanted to see. I got to sail around the world playing volleyball and baseball while I waited! I only had one or two duties to do, besides that it is all fun!

2cc98cb,"Would one like to be a Seagoing Cowboy? Well it's a bad idea to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Well first, one has to be on sea for a couple weeks. Then one also has to responsibe for taking care of animals. And lastly, one needs to be careful on a cattle boat. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a bad, dangerous, and horrible idea.

First, a Seagoing Cowboy has to travel all around the world. Does one really wants to be sea sick? Well a Seagoing Cowboy needs to be on a cattle boat for maybe about two weeks or maybe more across the ocean. And one needs to worry about the dangers of the sea. Lastly, one needs to take night shifts for a couple reasons. What about the rest they need of being so busy? In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy is about dealing with the sea. So, not only the sea is a bad idea for a job, but also taking care of the animals.

A Seagoing Cowboy is not only traveling, but also taking care of the animals. First, a Seagoing Cowboy has to take night shifts just for taking care of the creatures. One needs to check on all the animals every hour as well. Furthermore, one needs to feed them every two or three times a day. Who's going to clean the ship after the animals eat? Next, one needs to give them water as well as a plants, animals, and Seagoing Cowboys needs water. So, does one really want to be dealing with the animals and the care they need? Not only being a Sea Cowboy is a terrible idea, but also taking care of themselves and the boat.

Sometimes a Sea Cowboy can be tough, but they also need to be careful of what they're doing. Did one hear of how Luke hurt himself? Well he had a report from his captain and slid down a slippery ladder. Why was it so slippery? Well he was on a boat with water surrounding it! And if one slipped and can't swim, and went in the water...well that one person will be at the bottom of the dark Atlantic sea. But Luke cracked his ribs just from sliding down on a slippery lader on his backside. One also needs be careful of whats ahead of them. The dangers of the sea, the water, and other people who are going to want to stop a Seagoing Cowboy from saving a country. So why be a Seagoing Cowboy?

In conclusion, a Seagoing Cowboy will need to take care of themselves of being injured or sea sick, animals, and what a Seagoing Cowboy will have ahead of them. So DON'T be a Seagoing Cowboy who might be at a great risk. Next, don't be at th bottom of the sea. Another, reason for being a Seagoing Cowboy is because one doesn't want to be frustrated of taking care of couple of animals. And please don't be on a cattle boat if one doesn't want to clean what animals/peoples left overs. These are the reasons why being a Seagoing Cowboy is a terrible, horrible, bad idea.

Seagoing Cowboy. He saw a lot of stuff on the boat as you can tell on paragraph 5 he said, ""Besides helping people,I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" That would be a great experince for a small town boy. I think it was a great idea to join the program because, you could tell your grandchildren about all the things you have seen and done. If his friend had not been there to tell him about it he would have been working two jobs his whole life. Luke is probably very greatful.

Luke is also the best there because he has went threw the route nine time as you see on paragraph 6. Luke point of veiw would probably tell more about what he saw during the trip and what he did. He loves to help people by this job he has helped bring all the cattle/food. Luke is very talented for having this job because you have to feed the animals about three times aday and keep them alive. You can state this information on paraghraph 6 and 7. He worked so much he got hurt and craked his ribs. He was happy to be alive. Therefore he had to stay at home to get better.

Luke's point of view would also tell how fun it was to work there and he would convince you that it is a realy good job. He was very happy to get this job beause he said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity."" Luke created history and when he could not do the job any more people visited him all the time like students and many familys to live on all the history he made. It opened up Lukes world up when he got the job. Its also so cool how they played sports when they had free time to take the time away. Its amazing how he can get all those animals and pick them up on the boat and take them across the country and drop them off. He was realy good at his job to do that!

Luke knew this was a once in a life time opportunity. Luke had said yes and at that moment he had just began an amazing adventure.

Luke had a very good experience that might have inspired the reader to do the same things. Luke was not only traveling in a boat to Europe but, he was also helping people get back to good shape because, world war 2 had just ended leaving them in bad shape. Students should be inspired because, Luke was helping people get back in good shape. People might also convinced to do the same thing Luke did.

Luke was having a lot of fun traveling around the world on a cattle ship. Luke knew this was an amazing opportunity in his life. Lukke himself had said that this was an amazing opportunity for a small town boy. He saw so many amazing things in the places he went. Luke had mentioned that he had been to Europe, China and Greece.

As Luke was on that cattle ship, he was helping people around the world get back to good shape, he was helping society. He was also bonding with animals, he was taking good care of animals. Most importantly it seemed like Luke was learning about the world and animals on this experience. Luke was experiencing how hard work felt. Luke, was really busy as they were crossing the Atlantic Ocean. He had to care of the animals by, feeding them, also giving them water and cleaning their stalls.

Thia will allow you take care of animals travel to different places, and trust me I have been on there it is very fun. If you are not persuaded enough let me give you 4 reasons why you should join.

The UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Now imagine that, while the animals were over seas the probably got hurt. Wouldn´t you want to help them I know I would. There were night watchmen, his job was to check on all the animals every hour. That sound like alot of work but it´s not.

Here is another reason, besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. I bet you haven´t seen Europe or China. Wouldn´t you like to see there lifestyle there clothes and all the other stuff they have. Probably learn a new language. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. It really was special all of ther colors were beautiful.

My last reason is, after we unloaded the animals we had alot of fun. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Now that is fun, all the time you were takig the animals back you had to keep an eye on them, but when they were unloaded you would have alot of fun.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up the world to me. I´m grateful for the opportunity, it mad me aware of people of other countries and their needs.

A nation like ourselves should not be lazy and do nothing while others in the other countries are suffering. We need to treat others as ourselves and take a stand for each other.

Now that World War 2 is over, we need to fix the mess Germany has made. Some families have cousins or even brothers there. We need to come together and fix this mess. Because when we all come together as one nation, we can achieve anything! From then on we must hope this does not happen again.

Now all I ask is for you to come join me and my colliges as we sail the seas. Maybe you can just take a ship to England to help there. But all we need to do is come together to clean up a mess.

Once you join you will not regret your decision. You will feel like you have achieved something, and you will get to see the world. This mighty journey is not for the faint of heart. Who among you are strong enough and smart enough to take this journey?

The Atlantic is quite an ocean, it will throw everything it has at you. Women are welcome to come to help on land, but the men are the only ones who should be on the sea.

Men are still allowed to help on land if they would like. When the journey starts we need a spotter, a few animal keepers, and a capitain. All of which are open to anyone whom may want it.

We will also have much fun on our way back home. You can play games in the lower decks such as, Table Tennis, Boxing, Whittling, and more. So in conclusion, are you coming with me?",2,6,0.6023586988449097

It will all be worth it to see the smiles on the peoples faces! We could really use your help. The following shows all the important and awsome things you need to know about it.

One of the amazing pros of joining is you can help others. As Luke says,""It was an opportunity of a life time."" Helping people get back all the food supplies, animals, and more leaves a good feeling. It could make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs, like Luke.

The only complain that you might have is a few ingerys. Like when Luke cracked his ribs on one rainy night. You may get knocked over bord but that is very unlikly. All those times you helped people will surely make up for that. It could really be fun if you just try it. If you did not like your fist trip, you could always quit. At least you helped a few people out.

A few more exiting things woulg be the chance to sight see on your free time. Luke said,""Besides helping people, their is a benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, son was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy."" You may get the pleasure of seeing one, or both of those. Would that be awsome or what?

You can also have fun on the trip back. Like how Luke got to baseball and volleyball games after the animals got droped off. Table-tennis tornaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time of being at see. That way you are not bored out of your mind on the way back.

It can also be hard work to. You have to feed and water the animals two or three times a day. Sometimes you might have to take night watchman. That is were you have to get up every hour to check out the animals and report back to the captain. Just be careful or you might get hurt, like Luke did. Helping out with the animals can be fun, too. Even if it is exstrimly hard work.

Even if it is hard work you can still have fun. Sight seeing and the trip home is amazing. So come on! Join the Seagoing Cowboys program! It can be dangderous and hard, but in the end there are more great things to do than all the small dangers. Hard work is the price to pay if you do want to join. All the sights to see, helping people in tmes of needs, and the awsome trips will be fun!

For example, Luke couldn't say no to his friend Don because it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime for him. Luke and Don were both happy that got a chance to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

Luke and Don were on the boat to tranport horses, cows, mules, their food and supplies to ship them overseas. When they signed up they were told to report to New Orleans in August 1945. They arrived on the day that the Pacific War had ended. They boarded a ship with 335 horses some hay and oats to feed them. This would be great evidence to join the Seagoing Cowboys Program.

On the other hand, most people think that it might be dangerous for kids to join the program. In the text it says that ""Luke slid down the stairs and was stopped by a piece of metal."" Luke couldn't on the boat because he craked his ribs. In the text it also states that ""But being a Seagoing

was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him."" Luke was also happy to be alive without going overboard.

2edae7a,"Have you ever wanted to be a cowboy who crosses the sea? Now you can, if you join the seagoing cowboys program! I think you should join the program because you get to help nations recover their supplies and explore the world as you travel which I thought was really fun to do.

One reason I think you should be a seagoing cowboy is to help the nations by giving them more things they need such as food, animals, and more. I think helping the nations by doing this in the war will contribute to them so they could win if I give them the things they need to win the war.

Another reason I think people should join is to have fun. I say that because while you are at sea you could explore different places around the world. While being a seagoing cowboy, I visited places like Europe and China while i was working as a seagoing cowboy. I also went to Greece to see an Acropolis, and I even went to an excavated castle in Crete. When the animals are unloaded you could play many things such as Table-tennis, baseball, volleyball, and many more in the empty holds where the animals were.

In conclusion, i think people should join the seagoing cowboys program because you get to help the nations regain their supplies, and you get to have fun by exploring around the world. You should join because the seagoing cowboys program is fun and helpful to many people.",3,6,0.9036853313446045
2eddc0b,"The Seagoing Coyboys were having some of the best times of their life! Luke is a Seagoing Cowboy. Doing this job is so much fun! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is exciting because of the unique places, helping other people in need, and it keeps you very busy during the trip.

The first reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because of the unique places you go. The possible places are Greece, Crete, Panama, and Italy. You could see the acropolis in Greece. Taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy would be magnificent too! You could see the famous Panama Canal or an excavated castle in Crete. Thre are so many different opportunities! You could sign up for this program right now!

A second reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because you could help other people in need. Luke didn't even know of all the people of other countries. That awareness stayed with him for a long time. His family has hosted a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. Luke helped the countries in ruins that were left after World War II. He helped take care of the animals such as horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

A third reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because it keeps you extremely busy. You will be as busy as a bee! As I said, you take care of the animals they take overseas. The animals have to be fed, given water, and have their stalls cleaned. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship. Luke was also a night watchman once. He had to check on the animals every hour. He had to make an hourly report as well. You don't work the entire time either. You have time to play games and do sports as well.

Some people may say you should not be a Seagoing Cowboy. They may say it takes too much time or it does not do you good. I would counter this statement because this job teaches people responsibilty of taking care of animals. Being overseas does take a while, but it does teach people patience. There is also time to sightsee and play games. These reasons show being a Seagoing Cowboy is not a waste of time.

After reading this article, I learned a bunch about Seagoing Cowboys. I still don't think this job is a waste of time. This job will teach you many things. Afterwards, people will be as happy as a puppy wagging its tail! All of these reasons lead me to believe that more people should join this program.             ",4,6,0.8821756839752197
2eeab39,"Hello and my name is Luke and I am a Seagoing Cowboy.

I have seen many things since I became one.

So, I want you to try and give it a chance.

My friend, Don, invited me to go to sea when I was working in a grocery store and bank.

I couldn't say no so I went with him.

When I got there, they hired Seagoing Cowboys to go out on the ocean.

When I became one, I had to go to Greece.

But before I got there, I turned eighteen years old.

Then, after the trip to Greece, I made nine trips, more than any other Seagoing Cowboy.

You get see amazing sights when you are on a trip.

Taking care of horses and cattle on the sea can be very fun.

It is a very fun thing to do on the sea.

But if you hve little paitience, I don't think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

One normal trip is can be about two weeks.

And a trip to China can be about a month.

But if you can handle paitience, I would be okay with you trying the program.

So if you like going to foreign countries, raising cattle, and going on sea, you should try the program.",2,6,0.8808342218399048
2f05f6d,"I think that you should particpate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because their are new things you could learn. Also joining the Seagoing Cowboys program changed my life.

You should join the program if you like going to new places or if you like trying new things. If you love going to new places then this is the program for you because you will get to see a lot of knew places you haven't been before. I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured excavated castles in Crete and marveled at the Panama canal on my way to China, But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Or if you don't like exploring places you haven't been don't worry because there are plenty of other things for you to do there like for instance when we leave the animals and are on are way back we play tons of games. Also you get to meet knew people there, so you would end up makeing tons of friends. Also a lot of times when people participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program they end up tying new things they would't normally try or that they haven't tried. Also joining the program helps build you into a better person because you're helping out with the animals. Another thing is that the cattle trips were amazing for a small-town boy like me. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will learn to take care of animals. If you're a bit affraid of animals don't worry they won't bite, well they might bite, but only if you make them really mad. It takes alot to make them mad though, so you will be okay and you won't need to worry about anything.

Some people might just say it is a useless way to spend your time, but I disagree because a lot of good things could come from it. Like you could make a lot of new friends there or you and your friends could join the program together to spend more time with each other. who wouldn't want to spend time with there friends playing games like table-tennis tournaments, fencing, and boxing. Or you could just read to pass time if you really wanted to. If you joined the Seagoing Cowboys program I think you would have a lot of fun. If you can't sleep or you like sleeping late you could be the nightwatcher. A nightwatcher is a person who watches over the animals.

I'm greatful that I had the opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it changed my life for the better, if my friend Don hadn't invited me to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat then I wouldn't had signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. I am so grateful that he took me with him to Europe.

If you get the opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys, I think that you should join the program. It really is a oppotunity of a lifetime, so you should say yes and step out of your comfort zone if you don't like things like that. You know it is good to try new things. If you do decide to join the Seagoing Cowboys program I hope you have a good time.

Sincerely,

Luke Bomberger",4,6,0.7842084169387817

If Luke wanted to tell someone to join the Seagoing Cowboys then he would want to in include the feeling he felt after seeing how much better people started doing after they helped them. He would probibaly also include that when they were done transporting the animals they got to go sight seeing and he would tell the person he ws trying to convince to join the Seagoing Cowboys that he got to go to/see Europe and China, he got to see Acropolis in Greece, he also would say he got to take a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, with streets of water, and he also got to tour an excacated castle in Crete.

When I graduated high school a friend of mine invited me to go to Europe on a cattleboat. Of course there are some advantages and disadvantages but, there are mostly advantages. If you have not already participated in it here are some reasons why you should.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it is a chance of a lifetime you will get to be in places like Italy, China, and Europe. You will be able to go sightseeing. As I remember I went to tour an excavated castle in Crete, I marvled at the Panama Canal, I saw the Acropolis in Greece which was special to me, and so was taking a gongola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. You will also be helping a lot of people and you can't be drafted by the military because it counts as a service. On August fourteenth we arrived we got the seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. On the way back we got to play baseball and volleyball and other games where the horses used to be. The dangers part is falling off the boat. In fact I almost fell off a boat but then I cracked my ribs. Also the job involves hard work.

Please join the Seagoing Cowboys It is a good program and you will help many people. Thank-you for reading.",2,6,0.8344271183013916

World War 2 was over in Europe which left many countries in ruins. To help recover everything 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys. Luke and Don decided to sign up to help take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

In August 1945 Luke and Don recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14 the day the Pacific war ended. Don and Luke boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece. The SS Charles had a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It also took Luke about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke was busy all the time while crossing because he had to take care of the animals. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls also had to be cleaned.

On Lukes second trip he served as niht watchman. Luke's job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. Luke was happy to be alive, but coudn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Luke is trying to convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program becasuse he wants others to help out recover other countries food supplies, animals, and more stuff that they have lost during the Wars. Luke wants everyone to be a part of helping others because without any help nothing is possibe.

Luke wants you to go through helping others and taking care of animals like how he did. Like when Luke got on the SS Charles W. Wooster when he was headed to Greece because the Pacific war had ended and everything was ruined or destroyed. He had a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. That is hard work. He had to stay up as watchman to take care of the animals and report to the captain. Luke got hurt but after the accident he began to help again. Luke want you to work as hard as him to save the world. Wars can cause a buch of damage to countries so try to help them out.

For example, you could go to Greece and see the Acropolis. I turned 18 before we arrived at Greece, which ment I could be drafted for military service. They told me to just keep working on the cattle boat, and that would count as my service.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program means you also get to work with animals. Some of the animals you get to work with are horses, young cows, and mules. It can take a while to get to our destination. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China!

The Seagoing Cowboys program can be very fun. Sometimes, the cowboys play games, such as, baseball, volleyball, and table tennis. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun, but it can be dangerous at times. On my second trip across the Atlantic Ocean as a cowboy, I was a night watchman. I was supposed to check on the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making my hourly report, I slipped down a ladder. My feet shot toward an opening on the side of the ship.

If there wasn't a strip of metal that caught my side, I wouldn't be here today. I couldn't work for a while because i broke a few ribs. I thought that was fine, because I was still alive. I'm very grateful for the opporrtunity, because it made me aware of people in other countries and their needs. Its a wonderful expierence helping someone in need.

The benefits of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program include helping other countries in need, a lot of free time with amazing experiences, and meeting new people that he worked with and the people that he helped recover. First, I will talk about how becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would not only benefit you but also benefit other people in countries that had been damaged from the wars.

The main reason Luke had joined the Seagoing Cowboys program was to help other people that lived in countries that had been involved in the wars. Luke joined the program to help them recover and Luke had said ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Luke had been talking about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Luke's family also hosted many international students and exchange visitors for many years. Luke learned about the current situation in other countries while on the trip while he was helping other people at the same. Secondly, I will talk about how Luke got a lot of free time and got to go to many places such as Greece.

The rides were not quick because the Seagoing Cowboys had to cross oceans. It took two weeks to a month to get to their desired destination. Luke was often kept busy with the animals to care for but when they were returning, he got a lot of time that he could spend with the other people on board or visit locations. Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece, ride a gondola in Italy, tour a castle in Crete, and visit the Panama Canal in China. Luke also often did activities with the other men on board such as play sports in the space they had after unloading the animals. Luke was grateful for the opportunity of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Next, I will talk about how Luke got to meet new people.

Luke had just been invited by his friend, Don Reist, to go on a cattle ship so he didn't know many people on the ship. Luke got to meet the other Seagoing Cowboys during the acitivities onboard the cattle ship. Luke also got to meet new people in the locations he visited. Luke got to travel the world and meet new people from different places. It exposed Luke to the needs of countries and that was one thing Luke learned while being a Seagoing Cowboy. Finally, I will discuss why it would be a good idea to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy had been hard work but it also had many benefits. Luke not only helped others but learned something about other people in other countries. Luke had many benefits from joining the program such as helping other people in different countries, having a fun time with other people, and meeting new people. in conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy could benefit anybody.",4,6,0.828827977180481

The main Items Sea Cowboys brought to the other countries were lifestock, and building supplies to rebuild cities and towns. Like in the story, To be a Sea Cowboy you have to be willing to travel around the world and also to spread your heart to others and help them. These are some reasons why I think Seagoing Cowboys are so great!

They take over night trips, and even month long trips or Even maybe YEAR long trips to go to people. Now, I do like helping others but if had to take month long trips that would be a nightmare so, their really giving somehting up for others. These people as in the story could just be 18 which is really young and still go out on the open waters for so long. You might think might they die of bordem, well no, because on the there and back they usal have sports like baseball tournments where the animals are staying. They also play ping-pong and foozeball which are table sports. Next, I will tell you about the incredible journeys you go on.

Now, I bet you proably have the world at your fringer tips now cause of devices and I know I sure do. In 1945, you have to think, I mean their entertainent was listenig to the radio, or playing outside. When the Seacowboys traveled the world there was so much to see and do. In the story it mentions them going to Greece and seeing amazing things and also, Luke had turned 18 and could be accepted into the military. Luke had Choosen not to though because, being a SeaCowboy was already enough of an honnor.

The Seacowboy spot was an overall honnor to and it was escpesailly fun. This paragraph will be about some of the animals onboard. The usual was Horses and water/feed, this is another reason you would stay busy on the 1-3 month long trips. Luke says"" The cattle boat trips were an unbeliveible opportunity for a small town boy"". Luke also had other exprinces with animals since he said he had worked on his moms old farm, so if you've every worked you have been a great fit fo the Seacowboys.

Now I have givin you great facts and reasons to join the Seacowboys. You get to see and live in other peoples cultures. You get to travel the earth(Europe and China) mostly those two. See the WWII reckage which was an important time in history. Lastly, Live with animals on a boat and see how they act and behave for a couple of months.

On all of those trips, Luke was helping deliver cattle to other countries to recover their food and animal supply. Many countries were in ruins and they needed the help that the Seagoing Cowboys provided.

Next, more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because they would get to see and visit many unique and interesting places around the world. The text states, Luke was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. The text also states, on his many trips, Luke got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Which had made him brave enough to cross the oceans just him and some other people on board of the ship or boat.

That's why I think Luke should presuade other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It would be a great opportunity for them. They would get to experience and see some really good, beautiful things out there. There might be some slips and falls but they would probably be fine like Luke did he fell and sliped up he ended up being fine.",2,6,0.7863459587097168
30ee72d,"Being a Seagoing Cow is great way to get to know and see more things about other countries. In this draft I will talk about why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. When you become a Seagoing Cowboy you are helping others and at the same time you are having fun. When you arrive at your destination you are not only delivering goods but you are seeing many amazing buildings, landmarks, statues, and more.

Being a seagoing cowboy is hard work but it is for the greater good, as in helping others during World War Two. A way to start can be by getting offered by a friend or offering a friend. After the War, people in different countries needed supplies, and fast, so a Seagoing Cowboy could get the jobs done. Making the world a better place is a good thing to do. Plus when you do so you feel good that you have done something that has helped others.

When you are done dropping off your load you have a lot of extra time on the way back so you can play games like table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fensing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass the time. Traveling all around the world can show you that a lot of countries are in need of food and help.

It will take a while to cross the sea to where you are going, and if you have animals on the ship you have to feed almost all animals two or three times a day. Ypu have to be up for the hard work of cleaning animal stalls, feeding animals, night shift watching, and more.

I hope you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy, and enjoyed the draft. That's what I have to say about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy and why you should become one.       ",3,6,0.8001949787139893

My friend Don covinced me to join so you should join.

The program was started by the UNRRA or the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. They hired the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of hores, young cows, and mules while they where going across the sea. they fed the animals hay and oats and gave them water. I one time almost died when I was working on the boat at night and watching the animals. I slipped and was sliding down and if the peace of metal was not there I would of fallen into the dark Alantic. I could not though because of my cracked ribs. Other things we would do while on the boats is play table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling to pass the time. I have benn doing this for many years but i dtill love it and you just meet so many new people on the boat and in all the different countrys.

The first reason is the program helps with people in need. Luke and Don go help people and sign up for program. Example-

Luke helped Katie's farm for checking the animals every night. Then he slipped and cracked his ribs so he coudn't work for a couple days. He also took care of cattle while on board.

The second reason is Luke going around the world. He went to many parts of Europe. In Greece he got drafted with the military. He went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean he took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do.

The last reason is Luke going around and giving supplies. In the first paragraph he worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe he gave cattle to people or farmers. He probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down.

First of all by joining you get to help those in need. While I was a Seagoing Cowboy we had to care for a country's animals that were shipped overseas. Which was an amazing experience for a small-town boy like me, which surely this would be a great experience for you too. Another example is that you get to visit many different places. Once I was able to see Europe and China, even Acropolis, Greece. Also I got take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. It was an amazing experience that you would feel almost everyday if you joined the program. May I add you will have fun? Once when we took return trips, after the animals been unloaded, we would play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals were housed. We also would play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and even play games to pass the time. It was a fun time.

Before arriving in Greece, Luke turned 18 years old, which meant he could be drafted for military service.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept him busy.

I believe that the Seagoing Cowboys is a great program because it will save many animals lives.

As it says in the text, you not only participate in a great event, but you also get to go on a tour. Because the animals you need to pick up are so far away across the Atlantic Ocean, you can see many countries as well as Crete and China. I also found time on board to where I could actually play games and have fun besides feeding animals.

And if somethings fun and easy, and you get paid for it why not try it out? So I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

One reason that you should join is because you could see some amazing sights as well as visit different countries, such as China, Italy, and Europe. Some sights that you may see would be the Elfell Tower, or roads made out of water, but only if you join.

Another reason is that after you dropped the animals off you could do some activities on the way back, like fencing, baseball, volleyball, whittling, and table tennis tournaments. That sounds like more than fun time by my standards.

I know some may say that they wouldn't do it because of sea sickness or others might say that it would be too dangerous because of bad wheather, but you can overcome sea sickness and the boats you're going to be on are made to withstand bad wheather. Plus I'm pretty sure that if the wheather's going to be bad we're not going to be sent out in it with the risk of losing cattle or horses.

You will have todo the same and persue with the action. I had to do it for myself to accomplish something.

The reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because it's such an experince.

When you are doing your job not only are you working, you are helping other people and it gives you that good feeling down inside. As you are doing you rounds or trips or whatever you want to call it is a great opertunity for a young boy or grown man to see alsorts of stuff, like different cultures and different countrys. Another reason is your an animal lover you got yourself a job but remember one thing you do need to be strong and tuff. If you are worried about being board trust me we have loads of stuff to help you pass time some of the stuff includes, Table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games so you dont half to worried about being bored.

There are some great dangers about being on sea. On my second trip I served as a watchman . My jod was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night I was makeing my hourly report to the captin and I slid down the slipery ladder and landed on my back side. I was happey to be alive. The one problem was that I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. You shouldent have that problem.

Well thats realy all I can say. Yes I agree it dose have its downfalls but thers more good things than bad I can personley tell you that. It realy helped me open my mind to the world. It helped me understand the problems other countries were facing and I realy hope it helps you open up your mind. With all my information I hope to see you at sea helping the animals.

351b4e8,"In the article, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" A boy named Luke Bomberger went on an ""adventure"" as an Seagoing Cowboy. There are positive and negative things about the ""adventure."" But, I still think people should try out the Seagoing Cowboy programs, because you you can see many wonderful views and ects.

One reason people should try out the Seagoing Cowboys program is, you can visit many places that you haven't been before like, China, Europe, and ects. Imagine your living in U.S.A right now, and you dream is to go to Europe. Your dream can come true from trying the Seagoing Cowboy programs! Also, places like Europe and China have their own cultures, which are extremely different from U.S.A's culture. According to paragraph 5, it said: ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" So, not only you can visit wonderful places, you can also help people at the same time!

Another reason is, you can play games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and ects. Playing sports is one of the most popular thing to do in the world. When people have fun doing things, it feels like time pass away extremely fast. The adventure may take weeks or even months, but with fun things like these sports, it'll feel short.

Like I said in the first paragraph, you can see many wonderful views. This reason kind of connect to the visiting places that you've never been before, because when you go to a new place, there will be new things you'll see and learn about. Like I said before, most places have different culture. You can find new things or learn something. Some places have different languages to other countries/states. So, maybe you'll learn new languages and you can communicate with people.

These are some reasons why people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It might take a long time to travel, but it'll be fun! There might be chances the participators will get hurt, but what is life withour a few accidents?

Lke Bomberger had participate in this program many times, but he still think it's wonderful. According to paragraph 9, Luke said: ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That represents he think this program is magnificent and fun!    ",3,6,0.7868963479995728

I went on gondola in Italy and I took nine trips. That was the highest than any other Seagoing Cowboy. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you could beat my highscore. It might take long to go place to place but it is worth having fun on the boat so it doesn't get boring like that and this ain't where it ends. the fun doesn't stop here.

If you don't have fun going to different countrys. Then, have fun on board.

Make up tournaments while you are going to a different place play different games like baseball, volleyball, and much more to do on board. Then, relax and read a book and sleep or take a nap and feed the animals and keep them clean so they don't be stinky and filfty. Keep yourself occupied and do something so you don't get bored and quit.

There are so many reasons to become a Cowboy. For starters, if you don't know how to do what a Cowboy does watch from other Cowboys or ask for help. Secondly, if you want to relax and to have a peaceful time just read a book in a quiet place and read so no one has to bother you. Lastly, the animals need your help to survive and live and so they could go to the other countrys they need to go to so that they could be fed and taken care of.

353e838,"Man, I enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy. I got to help so many people! You should sign up! The purpose of Seagoing Cowboys was to help countries that have suffered from WW2, such as Greece and China. It was created by UNRRA, and was very helpful to all critical European countries.

A few reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because we bring horses, cows, and muless to countries in need and we also take care of these animals. You also have some time for sightseeing. However, there is some danger of signing up. Seeing as you´re on a boat most of the time with hundreds of animals, you have limited space, and then you have the dangers of the sea. When I say dangers of the sea I mean things like drowning, storms, et cetera.

Now, I want to tell you about how I got into Seagoing Cowboys, and my story of being one. It was 1945. I had two part-time jobs at the time, and my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to join him in going to Europe on a cattle boat. World War 2 had just finished, and lots of European countries were in a critical state. 44 nations joined to make the UNRRA, and they hired people to take care of cattle that were being shipped. Don and I both signed up.

In August, we were told to go to New Orleans for our job. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, a cattle boat with more than 300 horses. I was discharged in 1947, and I had made history. I made 9 trips, which is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It was impressive, seeing as I couldn´t work for a few days due to broken ribs. I was so proud of myself, and it was definitely more than a job, it was a way to help me be more aware of others´ needs.

Well, I have to go back to my job at the supermarket. I recently was rehired and got my position back in the meat department. Now, isn that ironic? Remember, if you have the chance to be a Seagoing Cowboy, take it! It´ll open up so many parts of the world to you. ",3,6,0.8650156259536743

They arived Augest 14. The day the pacific war ended ''luke said''.Luke had made 9 trips. Thats the most of any seagoing cowboy.

The cattle-boat were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small town boy. He had the benifit of seeing Europe and China. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete .And marveled at the panama canal on his way to china.

It took them about two weeks to cvross the Alantic Ocean. It took them about a month to get from the eastern cost of the U.S. to China. Caring for all of thoes animals kept them really busey. They had to be fed,and watered 3 times a day and there were lots of animals there too so it was harder than it seems.

The thing that you want to do is help people out you would have the opportunity to go to Europe and China. It would take about 2 weeks to cross Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. So caring for the animals is a nice and helpful thing that would keep you busy. Stalls had to be cleaned out every single day and you have to feed them.

Also while you are in these amazing places you can sight see. That isn't the only thing you will be remembered by those people in those different places. You will be remembered as a hero to them because you helped them while they were in need.

Now I'm gonna tell you about my experience as a Seagoing Cowboy. The traveling was amazing because I got to go to different place and help people and see their homes. Then as I went to these different place I got to see the different building and sculptures that have probably been there for decades. So the thing that I did you can probably do as well or maybe even more.

I am here because many people argue whether be a Seagoing Cowboys is something you should do. I believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy is worth the risk all just so you could help people and just have fun.

Helping people in need is really what matters in lfe. Its really in every human job there is. A dentist helps your teeth keep clean, a teacher helps you learn, and a mechanic helps you fix your car. Almost every human job out there is all about helping people. In my case I got to help people in need after World War II . I was in a group called UNRRA, which was a group who helped pople in animals and food supplies. I feel good now that I know I got to serve countries that were left in ruins. I am sure mighty proud that I became a Segoing Cowboy. It helped me realize that not only I need help but other people are also in need of help.

I also had lots and lots of fun while I was a Seagoing Cowboy. In case you ever got bored, there was no problem playing games. There were so many to choose from. There was baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. I was so entertained. When we played games the time flew by as if it were a cheetah on the clock. There was usually no way you could have got bored with all the choices you had as entertainment. This is another reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys.

I will warn there will be risks in doing this though. I know it sounds kind of dangerous, but I believe that it is worth it, and I would know. I once was night watchman, I had to check that every thing was going smoothly. Everything was going okay untill I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside. I was heading for a entrance at the side of the boat, but a small strip of metal stopped my slide. I could have flown straight into the Atlantic Ocean. I also had broken ribs so I coulndn't work. Even though this happened I am still very grateful that I am alive and still helping people in need. I feel good putting my life at risk for millions of people in need.

I know that there is risk but it is worth it. You get to have fun and have a good feeling in your heart, all for just helping people in need. I am grateful for the oppurtunity, and it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. I do believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy is worth it.

The last thing I got to do was vist the excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

The reason my trip was tough was because I got to be a gaurd all night. I chose to be a night they didn't chose me I chose them. The job wasn't so bad, it was tough because I had to make sure the animals were feed three times a day. I also had to watch and make sure that nthing was strange and I had to make sure there was't any invaiders. I also had the job of making sure to tell the captian the weather reports.

My second reason is that you would be able to see global landmarks throughout your journey. Luke was a witness and he said that, ""the trips were an unbeleivable oppurtunity for a small town boy."" You would learn what it is like to travel far and wide across the Atlantic Ocean.

My last reason is that not only would you be able to see global landmarks, but you would also be able to enjoy yourself throughout the trip. The passage states that the cowboys played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and reading, whittling, or games also helped pass some of the time.

To support the reason that they get the benifit of seeing Europe and China. They see most of Europe. They see most of China too. And they see what most ordinary people don't get to. This shows why people should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program.

And to support the reason that your serving for the orginazation of UNRRA. They are part of the UNRRA . The UNRRA stands for (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). And so they are helping the debistated countries of Europe and China from world war 2.

Last to support the reason that they are helping others in need of animals from the debistation of world war 2. They are giving people animals. They are also giving people their needs. And from those animals they are getting people the products they need.

And I see why people do not want to join the program. maybe they want to stay with their families, or they get sea sick, or the fact that they just don't like animals.

In conclusion this is why people need to join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. Like I said, they are sending animals to the countries that were debistated from world war 2.

Some fun places that you might want to vist is Europe and China because they different kind of historial and beautiful sites.

When Luke truned 18 thay could have drafted him over to the army but they didn't. Luke claims in the article that he was ment for the job becues he was rased on his aunt's farm. Yet he was not ready for the sea.

Luke said he saw some pritty cool stuff. Thay also had some fun on the ship when the anamals were out. When Luke came home his aunt was probuly rilly thankfull that he came back ok.

He probuly was thankfull that he got to come home becoues the other seagoing cowboys didn't do as much seagoing as him.

You should go to Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures, visit many unique places, and to help the nation.

People should go to Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures,visit unique places,and help the nation. In addition, when you go to Seagoing Cowboys you can go on many adventures.

In paragraph five, you can tour an excavated castle in Crete. On the other hand, the nation is in ruins from World War II so you can help the nation. For example, Seagoing Cowboys take care of the horses,young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas from the ruins. You should visit the Seagoing Cowboys because you can go on adventures,visit unique places, and help the nation.

People should go to Seagoing Cowboys for three reasons. One to go on adventures. Second you can visit unique places. Finally you can help the nation from the ruins.

of new things maybe you've never seen before. When I started doing this, I started in Greece when I was 18 which was the age you had to be to be drafted in the military for 2 years. But the Greek Government said I had to join the military for 2 years, or be a Seagoing Cowboy so I decided to be a Seagoing Cowboy for 2 years. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a lot better than joining the military, and it is a lot more fun if you do this with a friend.

I enjoyed seeing a lot of new places, especially China and Italy. The fun part about being Seagoing Cowboy is when you're not on a ship you're on a farm. While you're on a farm you can explore around and look at all the animals and feed them. There is also fun you can have on a ship. You can play sports such as, baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and many others.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy more than just fun and exploring. It opened me up to the world. I can't begin to explain how grateful I am to have been given this oppurtunity. It made me realize that there are people out there in other countries that have needs. So after being a Seagoing Cowboy, I decided to lead my family to host a lot of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

During my time of being a Seagoing Cowboy I saw Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and a excavated castle in Crete.

One of my favorite parts of being a Seagoing Cowboy was after we unloaded the animals. This is because we had the whole ship to ourselves, sometimes we even played games or sports in the area we kept the animals.

There are three reasons why you and others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One of them is taking care of animals, the other one is having unbelievable trips, the last one is the jobs you do and the free time.

The first one were going to talk about are taking care of the animals.

When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you have to care the horses until they go to a different person.

Another supporting detail is about the cows, you need the cows to get the milk from or what are the others participates going to drink.

The last supporting detail is the mules that were shipped overseas.

Those were all the supporting details for the reason about taking care of animals.

The other reason that were going to support is the unbelievable trips they travel by.

The first supporting detail is about the cattle-boat trips they get when they participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Also, we get to tour an excavated castle in Crete.

they also marveled at the Panama Canal on there way to China. That is another reason why you and the others should participate.

The other reason you should join is you got to do many jobs so you won't be bored, and you also get free time.

One job you get is being a night watchman you get to check on all the animals every hour.

Another one is cleaning up. You have to feed and water the animals two or three times. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship, and also the stalls had to be cleaned.

Those were all the reasons and supporting details of why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

There were three things to support my reasons in each paragraph.

That is why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.",3,6,0.8741533756256104
37c0154,"Seagoing Coyboys. That's the name of the tremendous program I joined. I think a lot of people should join the Seagoind Coyboys program. The reason I think this is because it is a great way to sight-see, you're helping a large amount of people by giving them more of what they need, you can have fun playing all sorts of games and more, and you get the chance to go to new places.

The first reason I should convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because it is a great way to sight-see. In the story it says,""Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China."" It also states,""It was special taking a gondala ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" I think this enables the reader to realizeone of the reasons that the Seagoing Coybows is a program you should join is an great opportunity for people of all ages to sight see.

The second reason I think I should convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you're helping a large amount of people by giving them more of what they need. I can tell this by when the passage states,""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies,a nimals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administartion). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" That is the program that Don and I signed up for. This shows why I think you should join the Seagoing Coyboys program because you're helping a large amount of people by giving them what they need.

The third reason I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you can have fun by playing all sorts of games and more. In the text it states,""Luke also found time to have fun on board , especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the emty holds where animals had been housed."" After it states that it says,""Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, bowing, reading whittling and games also helped pass the time. This shows why I think you should join the Seagoing Coyboyws program because you can by playing all sorts of games and more.

The fourth reason think you should join the Seagoing Coyboys program is because you get the chance to go to new places. In the text it explains,""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" See, when you join the Seagoing Coyboys program you get to go to many places because you have to deliver the suplies and animals to the different places. So this shows, and explains, why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get the chance to go to new places.

All in all this passage I have written for you shows why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it is a great way to sight-see, you're helping a large amount of people by giving them what they need,you can have fun playing all sorts of games and more, and you get the chance to go to new places.",4,6,0.824295163154602

All you have to do is sign up it will be a opportunity of a lifetime. You will be able to travel to diffrent places for the Seagoing Cowboys Program.

First, there's countries that need food supplies and more. After the World War two some countries began to go poor, so 44 nations joined together and created the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaition Administration. They hired us (Seagoing Cowboys) to take care of animals such as cows,horses, and mules that were shipped. After the Pacific war we got seaman's papers and went to Greece with 335 horses and had enough food for them.

Second, this is a huge opportunity for your life. If you haven't traveled to a diffrent country before you will. You will be able to take care of people and also go places you never been before like Europe and China, trust me you will be excited. Another cool thing is that you will be able to be watchmen and check the animals on the boat every hour.

Third, some bad things about it is that it will take you weeks to go visit the other places you go to. It took me a month to reach China. You need to be prepared for the hard work you do. If you are the watchmen you have to be carefull not so slip on the ladder on a rainy day.

Last, its good and bad things about being a Seagoing Cowboy but mostly good things. When you returned after a trip overseas you can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds. We play games such as Table- tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,and other fun games. It can also show you how you should be thankful because people in diffrent countries don't have what you have.

It might be fun to go and help others in need but what about your job, lots of things could happen. You might have an exiting time but what about all the responcebilities you have if you go. I mean I wouldin't go because of that or because what if one person doesin't want to do it any more, our someone gets car sick. A lot of things can happen and you know what, I dont want to get car sick if I were you. Also what about home, theres opportuneities here. What about the people who are in need right now.

I know that if you just think there will be something to do for our community just like that. Like I said you don't need to got to Greece to see that!

You also get to travel places.

On the boat, time will fly, because you will be doing something fun most of the time. You get to see beatiful sites such as: the Atlantic Ocean, Europe, China, and the Acropolis in Greece.

In the passage it says that,''Luke and Don sign up to help Europe by shiping supply and other goods over sea. luke worked with the (UNRRA) helping with supply. luke and Don were known as a Seagoing Cowboys in the program.

In my opinion luke did the right thing because he's helping other people in other places. In the passag it says that,''In China luke help and took care of animals. Luke went to Greece and brought 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. So luke is helping people,animals,and he is helping with supplys. Luke is travling from sea to sea helping people and working very hard.

So these are my reasons on why I think that luke did the right thing. Also when luke took a trip to help people he also help countries who left in the ruins. In the passage it says that,''It was 1945,World War ll was over in Europe,and many countries were left in ruins. luke and don sign up to help people in those areas.

This to Luke this was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses. When Luke was 18 he could be drafted to be in the military but when they heard he was on a cattle boat trip they told Luke to stay. In 1947 Luke made nine trips the most out of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special,""he says.

If you get to go on this trip you would be busy but you would have so much fun. Also if you like caring for people and animals you would be perfect for this journey. Another reason is if you like travling on a boat and don't get sea sick you should try being a Seagoing Cowboy or girl. Not only that but you could become famous just for helping people.

He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy.

He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job.

That is very important because those countries were left in ruins, and people were left without food. And some of those peple were already injured.

Another reason to join the program, is because they get to travel around the world, and have fun doing it to. This is a good reason because lots of people dont like traveling long distances, beacuase they think its boring. But in the article, it says, "" Luke also found time to have fun onboard."", and "" The cowboys played baseball volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time."" That detail, supports that you can do activities to help pass time, have fun, and make to trip worth-while

My last reason to join the program is beacuse you would be helping a lot of needy people. Not only does the UNRRA help lots of people, but so does the 'Seagoing Cowboys' that come along with it. That program also helps a lot because they help feed and take care of animals that other people might not be able to.

Those are my reasons to

persuade someone to maybe join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"". If not the Seagoing Cowboys, then maybe the UNRRA. I hope reasons like these could change someone's mind, and maybe help them join.    ",4,6,0.8156790733337402
39a9978,"I think the Seagoing Cowboys program should be broght back because it helps people around the world. It gives the Seagoing Cowboys the chance to learn diffrent languges. It also gives the Seagoing Cowboys the chance to foster exchange students.

It helps people around the world by giving them food. It gives them food by the cattle that the Seagoing Cowboys bring to them after a atacke or a war has hapened. Plus the Seagoing Cowboys have to learn to take care of the cattle that helps them. It helps the loackels with the damage. That was the first reason

The secand reason. It gives the Seagoing Cowboys a chance to lern diffrent langes. It dose this by when the Seagoing Cowboys travel to many diffrent countreis the may pickup on the langeuse. If the go to China the might pick up on Chinases. If they go to France they might pickup italan. If they go to spain they might pickup Spansish.

The third reason. It gives Seagoing Cowboys the chance to foster exchange stundets. It dose this by you traviling all over the globe and just fall in love with the kids. so when they come over during the school year you just foster them because you love them. It gives the kids a chance to have a proper eductian.

Weshould bring back the Seegoing Copwboys program because it is fun exciting and a lot more. But most inportinal it is helping the worlds people. It helps the people by giving them food. Fostering there kids whale they are here for a prpoer eaductain. And it helps the Seagoing Cowboys be good at heart. So therfor we should breing back the Seagoing Cowboys program.

39aa8f8,"Why should you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Well first let me tell you about a boy named Luke who was a Seagoing Cowboy. A Seagoing Cowboy is on this boat with other Seagoing Cowboys. To go help Europe where World War II just ended.

They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more. If you love to help, this would be something for you that you would enjoy. Luke traveled through the Atlantic occean and pacific. Trying to help these countries that were left in ruins. When Luke was on the boat he had a job to do. He had to feed the animals and keep them healthy. He also had to clean the animals and keep there stalls clean.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy you have a big responsibility. You also have alot of jobs to take care of. Another job Luke had, was a night watchman. That job was to check on all the animals every hour. Then make his hourly report to the captain. A Seagoing Cowboy wasn't always working. When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowboys played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part.

So this is what a Seagoing Cowboy is and what he does. If your someone who's willing to be on a boat for a long time and take care of animals and if you also love to help people. This job is perfect for you. While your on the boat you get to make new friends and explore unique places. It was just a big adevnture. Also if you love dealing with animals this is another good reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Take the information that I gave you. Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and if you have the heart like Luke, this is the job for you. ",3,6,0.8518081903457642
39f8317,"The problem we have at hand here is whether or not we should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. My thesis is we all should join the program and help everybody ravanged by the war. It helps a ton of people get better and it also gives you a good gut feeling that everybody loves to have. In the following text I am going to give you some of the reasons why we should all join the Seagoing Cowboys program and help other people.

My first reason we should all go into the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get the wonderful oppertunity to help other people. The people you will be helping have had there homes destroyed by war and all of their personal belongings including food, water, and any gifts they might have gotten. Think about the smiles and tears of joy when you arive at these peoples' houses bearing gifts of food and animals to keep them stocked up on food.

My second reason we should all join the Seagoing Cowboy program is you get to see all of breathtaking sights as you travel the sea on a boat. These places you will be going to will have a ton of awesome sight seeing spots on the way to enjoy with all of the other Seagoing Cowboys. Also once you drop off all of the animal you can do a lot of really fun stuff with all of your buddys. For example vollyball, baseball, and a lot lot more cool activitys and games.

In the Seagoing Cowboys program it is dangorous and I will give the other side who do not want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program that. I bet if you are saying it is dangerous and it is not worth the risk that you have never tried to help a lot of people before. When you help a lot of people you get the amazing feeling that by risking your one life you probably just saved a hundred more lives just by going on a month to two month trip from the spot you are in to the spot you are going.

In conclusion you should all join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a great oppertunity to help other people that have lost their homes and to see a lot of breathtaking sights that you would not normally get to see. It is dangorous but you can see all of the joy and relief that you are giving to the people who have suffered great loss do to the ravanging way the war has treated them. I know that if you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys that you could be the thing that people in other countries dream of coming the next day with the gift of savour for them and their familys.",3,6,0.861549437046051

First, you get to help others in need. It was felt amazing being able to help those who were hurt in the war. I also got to visit beautiful Europe and China. It was unbelieveable too seing the Acropolis in Greece. Taking a gondola ride over wonderful Venice, Italy was breathtaking. I also had a tour through a castle, how great is that? I was also marveled by the Panama Canal on my way to China.

If you enjoy animals, you'd love this job. While on the two week trip crossing the Atlantic, the animals kept me very busy. I got to feed and give water to them about two or three times a day. But, stalls had to be cleaned.

It was always fun on board, especially on return trips because I got to play baseball and volleyball, which were held in the empty animal holds. We did many other activities, like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games.

Mainly, this experience made me more aware of people of other countries. This awareness even lead to my family generously hosting some international exchange students.

The Seagoing Cowboys is an amazing program. There a many reasons why I believe this, and I tried to list most of them. If you do not try this fun, great, wonderful thing, then you're missing out.",3,6,0.8435523509979248

Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called ""Seagoing Cows"" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them.

You could always hang out with the animals feed them or play with them if you want or if you want to be alone you could go in one of the empty rooms.

What if we dont have any free time? Well there one thing you could do to pass the time care for the animals they keep you busy because they have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats have to be pulled up from the lower tower and stalls have to be cleaned because when sailing it does take a long time to cross oceans it takes at least 2 weeks.

In conclusion you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program because there are so many interesting things that you can view with your own eyes that you could bring up later on or even write a story on later in life. You could have so much fun and if your just a small town boy then it would be an honor to tour the world and experience things on your own especially if you love animals.

3dce6b8,"I (being Luke) think that you should be a seagoing cowboy. It is a fun experience to have in your life. Plus you do not get chance like this very often in your life. It is great fun. Here are some reasons you should join me:

If you like helping others you should join. Thats basicly all we do. We as Seagoing cowboys ship or trans port animals to other countries in need. We partern up with UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) which by the way is an awesome team. That is one of the main reasons why I joined.

One other reason is that you get to see the marvels of the world. Like Greece. That place was sure amazing. You get so much extra time after you deliver the cattle.

Another reason is that all that free time my crew and I play games and such during our free time as well. That means that you bond together and have life-long friends that will always be there for you.

I know this speech is long but I have one more thing to say. That if you are an animal lover than this is the job for you. You get to be with animals 24/7. It is a dream-come-ture for animal lovers.",3,6,0.8520843982696533

""Hi, I'm Luke I am a Seagoing Cowboy!!!!""said Luke to the other towns people.

The people begin to walk away from the crowd with people yelling and shouting to Luke how boring he is and quiet. Luke felt bad because of this so he started to talk again.

""People listen up, I am here to make a statement. That would be why I called everyone here today.""

Someone shouts from the crowd. ""Get on with it little boy this taking up some of our presious time!!!!""

""I would like to persaude all the young boys AND girls to become a Seagoing Cowboy, if you would like to be a Seagoing Cowboy please raise your hand and I promise you, you will have a GREAT TIME!!!!! You will get to pet animals and visit castles and other great things like that so does anyone want to raise their hand now, Oh and you will get paid!!!!!""

About all the boys and girls raised their hand. The parents and or gardians because they were either poor or greedy. And wanted and/or needed the money. Many of those children joined but Luke wasn't quite done.

**** two weeks later****

He desided to take those children on one of his tours that he got to go on. The trip to the castle!!!!

""Okay guys here we are you can take off those blindfolds I gave you!"" They listened to him and took off the blindfolds they were given. And there it was the one thing they had all been waiting for, the castle!!!!!

Once Luke and the children got home they talked about the payments per week they will get five dollar bills. This excited all the children. They were so, so, so happy to here that news.

When the childre grew old they no longer went overseas. Even though the loved their jobs, they just had to retire.  ",1,6,0.6336572170257568

You would also take care of cows,horses,and mules.

To get to work for the Seagoing Cowboys Program would be amazing because you wold travel to many different countries. Say like Europe and China and could travel to Greece and see the Acropolis, take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,on the streets of water.

The trip would also be great beacuse you would find some fun stuff do while you're on the boat, like boxing, fencing, baseball, and tennis ball tournaments. But beaing a Seagoing Cowboy is more than just an adventure and plaing games its about helping people and other countries.

My demeanor was a lot more joyus then ever before. I knew that helping and saving inocent people and animals was the right thing to do. When you join this program, you get to travel the world; help people that survived WWll; save animals; and much much more. I vehemently suggest that you join this audacious progam. You will have numerous amount of fun with me, Luke Bomberger, and my buddy Don Reist.

Let me tell you about some of our adventures. One time we went to the melancholy country, Europe. WWll had just taken place there, and we were helping them recover from this disasterous war. We were collecting numerous amounts of food for them to consume, we recovered their sweet inocent animals, and much much more. I can tell you one thing, after we left that melancholy country, thier demeanors definatley changed. They were very exuberant, and they thanked us more than you could ever possibly imagine. Don and I were off seeking to find more adventure.

After we left the melancholy country, Europe, we headed to Acropolis, Greece and Venice, Italy. But the real adventure was going to China. At China, we cattle-boated, and took care of the sweet animals. Taking care of these animals sure kept me busy. They absolutley had to be fed; and watered at least two or three times a day. Their smelly; nasty stalls had to be cleaned, and bales of hay and oats had to be pulled up from the lower part of the ship. I helped my aunt out on the farm as a boy, and it had prepared me for hard work. The hard work at the farm sure didn't prepare me for this hard work on the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was more than an adventure for me. I am grateful for this oppertunity; this made me more aware of what other people's needs are. This program opened my eyes. The ""Seagoing Cowboys Program"" will forever be my favorite program. I was truely blessed with that exiting oppertunity. I am going to join again next year, you will see my name on the list, Luke Bomberger. I hope to see yours on the list also.

Its a big change to go through. It feels good to help out innocent animals in need. Although the trips to and from the sea can be dangerous, its very worth it to go join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Its kind of like being a cowboy and a pirate.

It is such a wonderful expierience to do this program. Its not something you can do everyday, its like being an NBA player, you cant just say you are one.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is in need of help from other herders.

Why would anyone want to do this? With the program, you are able to help out other people, do things you typically would not do, and have fun.

I think it is beneficial to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you are able to help out people.

It is important to help people because not only does it benefit them, it benefits you as well by bringing joy in to your life.

In the text it states that in 1945,

World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

This is just one reason why this program is beneficial.

Another reason why I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial is becuase you get to do different things in your free time that you would not normally get to do.

In the text it says that they got to tour many places.

My final reason why I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial is because you get to have fun.

In the text, it says that while they were unloading the animals, they played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading and even whittling.

For example, In 1945 World War 2 was over in Europe and it left many countries in ruins, and to help these countries 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). They hired us, ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. This helped the countries recover their animals. So, one reason why others should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program is to help others recover their animals.

Another reason why I think others should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is to be able to see the remarkable sights that you get to see while over sees.

The job of a seagoing cowboy is to take care of horses, young cows, and mules which are sent overseas to people that need them. While being in the Seagoing Cowboy program, there are many positive things such as being able to experience adventures, visiting many unique places, and having the opportunity to help people in need.

A Seagoing Cowboy is able to experience many adventures. When Luke was a seagoing cowboy, he had the chance of experiencing a storm while at sea. Think about how exciting and adventurous that would be! Also Luke says that he found time to have fun on board, especially once all the animals were taken care of or unloaded. The cowbobys would then play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds, or set up different sporting tournements. Experiencing a storm at sea and playing many fun games on board are just two examples of the many adventures that could take place as a seagoing cowboy.

If you are a seagoing cowboy, you not only have adventures but you also can see and visit many unique places that an average person wouldn't have the opportunity to see or experience. In Luke's nine years as a seagoing cowboy, he was able to see and experience some pretty interesting things in Europe and China. He specifically saw the Acropolis in Greece, and thought that that experience was very special. On top of seeing the Acropolis, he also was able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. There would also be many more places to go and people to see.

The main reason for becoming a seagoing cowboy would be to help people in need. Luke specifically helped people affected by World War II. The people affected by World War II needed food, clothing, animals, and more. Luke helped with the animals. Luke states that he was very grateful for the opportunity of becoming a seagoing cowboy so he could help people in need.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience to have participated in. You get to see many natural and man-made landmarks you otherwise would not see. You get to visit many other cities and countries you would never be able to go to if you weren't hired as a ""cowboy on a boat"". Luckily, you can easily become a seagoing cowboy to make your life so much more exciting. Also, since you've always wanted to sail the seas, this would be a great opportunity. You'll always be excited as you float upon an uknown section of the earth. It almost sounds like a fairy-tale, but you can fortunatley actually live it. During what will be the greatest time of your life, you won't be lonely either.

As a Seagoing Cowboy, it's a chance to be social and put yourself in a friendly environment. You can play games and sports with the other participants. Find someone with the same hobby and have a conversation with them, so you will have a pal to do your favorite hobby with. Just have a talk about the things you saw, what you did, what you were thinking before you decided that it was obviously a good idea to become a Seagoing Cowboy for the UNRRA. Play table-tennis with them, maybe baseball, or volleyball. Do some reading by yourself or wih your pal to keep your brain just as good as it's always been. Maybe you want to box someone, or help someone out.

As a Seagoing Cowboy, you would be helping a lot of people and even countries get back on track after the devestating World War, which is unfortunatley the second world war. It could be a way to contribute to a charity. By directly delivering food, animals, and help to those who are helpless. Now, when you think about how that's what you're doing by going out to the sea, it makes you feel good, doesn't it? Not only does it make you feel great about your own life, but it actually makes another countries inhabitants feel good about their life, that they have their life despite the ruins of their country and their world after the war. So, it's obviously better for everyone when you become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Since you'll be helping other countries, having fun with friends, and experiencing a lot soon, you may be second-guessing yourself and thinking, ""What if I don't want to go to water, and I don't want to sail the seas?"" Well, assuming you don't like the water, you don't go on a boat often. Since one main thing of being a Seagoing cowboy is the experince, you'll be trying something you haven't done or don't usually do. You may still not like the fact you are on a boat in the sea, but after that, there are more benefits than there are things you don't like, which would be only one con. So you should join and participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program, make your life better, and others too.",4,6,0.8732544183731079

Also u are going to be having a lot of fun with the others playing alot of fun games and sports while u on board.You not always going to working but when there nothing to do the Seasgoing Cowboys find ways to have fun.Also you are going to help other all around the world.

If you are in the Seagoing Cowboys Program you will be more aware of people of other countries and their needs.While you're in the Seagoing Cowboys Program you are going to be the most brave and helpful people around the world.Aslo , when you are in the program sometimes you will have to be served as night watchman.But being a watch man on a rainy day is very harmful. You have to be very careful going down the ladder.

It is a very important job of being in the Seagoing Cowboys Program. You will have to help countries and people all the time.           ",2,6,0.837324321269989
42a21d9,"Are you thinking about joing the Seagoing Cowbows? If you are I got plenty of reasons why you shoud and also what you do in this program. Think to yourself what would you do in Seagoing Cowboys.

I think that you should join the

Seagoing Cowboys because it will allow you to expeirence and visit many unique places.

When you are on board the ship you can find many things to do and many games to play. Sometimes after the animals were unloaded the would play baseball and volleyball. In

On the ship there is many things tod o. Some people have to take night watch to stay up and watch the animals. During the day you have to feed and water the animals three times. If someone on that boat didn then those animals would be useless.

Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy and he did a lo og these things i said. Luke took night watch to watch the animals, that noght after ruturning his report in he fell down stair towards an opening of the ocean, but he caught himeself. Luke broke ribs so he could not work for a while. Also when he broke his ribs he found to have fun on the boat and off the boat. They could play games in the animals pen when they got unloaded. Like I said they could play games like Volleyball and Baseball.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy need s confidence and strngth, you oculd get picked to do any job but you dont know what it is. When your on the boat it is to late to go back becasue you are in the middle of the sea.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is an oppertunity to have fun make friends and explore. You can also go see new counties and got o unique places.

Some people can take that to heart.

Sometimes goi ng to a different country is like seeing something that you loved the most that you havnt seen in a while. That place you visit could be where your family originated from. Joining the Seagoing

Cowboys would be an amzing thin to do. Yes you would hae your ups and downs but you can always get back up. Just think if you join the Seagoing Cowboys you can do a lot of the things that you thought you could not do. That would be amazing. If I got the oppertunity to be a Seagoing Cowboy I would say yes because I like to push my limmits. ",3,6,0.8728765845298767
42faeed,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is life changing and adventurous experience .You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it helps people in need, it is a good opproutunity to see different sights around the world,and teaches hardwork.

In 1945 over 44 countries were left in ruins,from World War II in Europe,and they needed to recover. Those 44 countries joined together and formed the UNRRA(the United Nations Relif and Rehabilitaion Administration).The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of shipping animals to the broken down countries. While delivering animals you also get free time to sightsee. For example you can take a gondala ride while in Venice,Italy or be amazed by the Panama Canal on your way to China. Although,the sights are marvelous it is hardwork to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Animals have to be fed 2 to 3 times a day,food has to be pulled up from lower holds of the ship,stalls have to be cleaned and much more.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience to have. You help people in need,go to amazing places,see marvelous sights,and learn hardwork. The program can open up the world to you. Making you more aware of other countries and their needs. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a huge opproutunity to be in and you should definintly join.",3,6,0.8768335580825806
4313920,"You should definately participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys travel to many different countries around the world. There are so many places to visit. It is a great opportunity for people from small towns who don't get out of the house a lot to have a great adventure!

If you enjoy helping others, this is the perfect program for you! The Seagoing Cowboys help many countries who need help recovering their food and animals.

If you get really bored easily, this is another reason that this is a great program. You are always busy between caring for the animals and helping others!

Yes there may be some dangers over sea, but you have to be ready for everything. You also must be prepared to work extra hard!

Of course there is some time to have fun! The cowboys can play baseball or volleyball in empty rooms, or they can have ping-pong tournaments. There is also a lot of opportunities to make new friends!

If you want adventure and fun, and you enjoy caring for animals and helping others, then join the Seagoing Cowboys today!     ",3,6,0.8267682790756226
4334c97,"Have you ever wanted to go to the other side of the world? As a Seagoing cowboy you can do that and much more. You can see sights and learn about them. You learn about hard work and how to do different things. You can have fun while doing a job. Last, you get to help others who have less then you. If you like this stuff then this is the job for you.

One cool thing about being a Seagoing cowboy is that you get to see a lot of cool sights. You can travel to different parts of the world. In the article it talks about how Luke went to China, Greece, and other parts of Europe. Another thing about the sights is that you can learn new stuff about the places you see. Also you can meet new people and maybe even talk with them. Last, you can have your friends come with you and you can see the sights with them and enjoy both. The sights are great but what you learn is also great.

There are lots of things to learn on a cattle boat. One thing about being a Seagoing cowboy is that you learn about hard work. Like in the article it talks about Luke's aunt Katie and her farm that he worked on and how that prepared him for the hard work on the cattle boat. One thing that will help you learn hard work is caring for the animals on the boat. So when you come home your parents will be happy that you learned what hard work is so they can trust you with different things. Another thing you on a cattle boat is doing your share of work, because if you are not doing your share of work then your crew mates are going to get mad fast. Being on a cattle boat also keeps you busy so you can stay out of trouble in school or at home. All the stuff that you learn is good, but everyone wants to have some fun while doing a job.

Another reason that you should go on a cattle boat is that it is fun. No one wants to do something that is not fun. On the way back you get to play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. You can also read or whittle if you would rather do that. It also says in the article that Luke had fun on board the ship especially when they were returning. It is good to do a job that is fun to you, but also do a job that helps others and not your selve.

One last reason you should go on the trip is that it opens up your eyes to all the people who could use our help in the world. Like helping people who could use the food from the animals that you are bringing over or they could use the money that they would make by selling the animal. Like in the article it talks about Luke and how it opened up the world to him by saying ""I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

These reasons that I have given you show why you should work on a cattle boat. You will see great sights, understand about hard work, you get to enjoy it while doing a job, and you get to help out the world by the way Luke did. So why would you pass up the chance of doing all those things by becoming a Seagoing cowboy?   ",5,6,0.8678283095359802
433ec6b,"Luke encourages people to join the seagoing cowboys program because he thinks since when he were in the program it was amazing I know this because in paragraph 5 it says the cattle-boat trips were unbeliveible opportunity for a small town boy.

Also it says But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I think he thinks that the places they go are really special because each one of the Countries has different things about that country. Maybe one country might be more poor than the other but he is impress how they are manaing to keep their selves together and not fall apart.

Another reason I think Luke trys to convince people to join this program is so they can learn and change the way they used to be. The program can teach them alot I know this because in paragraph 7 it says Helping out on his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work, but not for dangers at the sea. Thats teaching him how to survive on his own he's getting taught and he is changing during this program so thats what he thinks this pro gram can do for other kids wanting to do this program.

Luke trys to tell you all the things you can be instead of the things you think you have to be. Before Luke was in this program he worked at a grocery store and as a banker I know this because in paragraph 1 it says Luke Bomberger had no idea that hi life could change soon after his high school graduation. he was working part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat so that why I think he trys to encourage people to join the program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways. One way is all the places that you travel to. I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China. Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities. Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program.

Our program also takes care of animals, but that can also be fun in many ways. One way is that it can keep you busy is when you are caring for the animals during crossing. They have to be fed and watered three times a day. What helped me prepare for hard work was when I would help on my Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Also I would serve as a night watchmen, which meant I had to check on the animals every night. Once I almost died doing that job one rainy night. As you can see, taking care of animals can be hard but also fun here at Seagoing Cowboys program.

My favorite part was traveling to many countries and all the beautiful sights. I have gotten to see Europe and China during our journies. Cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and have been on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, the city with streets of water. As you can see in the first paragraph, where it also shows I have been to many other places. In conlusion, you can see that traveling a one of the most fun parts of beingin the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Throughout the whole story, you can see that in the Seagoing Cowboys program, it is a fun experience, it helps animals, and you get to travel a whole lot. Those are some of the reasons that I would like others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.          ",4,6,0.8471794128417969

It all started when I was getting into my house and then I heard a knock on my door and then I opened. Don Reist was inviting me to go to Europe on cattle boat. I coulden't say no.

It was 1945 world war two was going on in Europe many countries were ruined from the war.

How they needed to recover was to have some suplies and food from me and other people.

Fourty-four nations joined together to form the UNRRA.

The hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses and young cows and mules that were shipped oveseas. Don and I had sighned up for this job as a Seagoing.

We arrived August fourteen the day that the Pacific war had ended.

Don and I got our seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W.Wooster headed for Greece. We had cargo of 335 horses and enough food to feed them.

It was a bad time to bee 18 because they could of sent me to the military service.

By the time that I was discharged in 1947 I had made nine trips the most of

any Seagoing Cowboy. The cattle trips were unbelievable. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean from the eastorn coast of the United States pluss caring animals and we fead them three times a day.

Help my aunt Katie's farm really helps me while all these thing but not as much for all the dangers that you face during this.

I also had a fun time on board with everybody on there.

We played baseball volly bal and many more activities.

While I was there it made me more aware of people and there needs the awareness stayed with me all my life because people from all around the world needed things that I had.

So Luke wen't over sea to show his friend he is not afraid. But when Luke is over seas something bad happens. Luke is feeding the animals, and he trips over something and just about fell over board to his death.

Then the boys had to find something to do so where the horses and the animals stayed is where the two kids started to play games like Baseball, Volleyball, Table-Tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling.

So when the two boys were done doing their stuff like playing games they wen't back to their homes, to see their families. But when their time was up off seeing their families they both wen't back to the ship, and said bye to their families for a long time then it was time to go.

The two boys did the same things they had done the last time they were on the sea. Then finally the day the two adults have been waiting for has now arrived to them. Now it is time to go back to their homes for good, and stay with their siblings and parents, and friends.

One thing that all the people noticed when the two got back fromw sea. Is that the two boys they use to be are now gentlemen, not lids anymore. Then the never let those two lovible boys go on sea again. They couldn'y loose the boys again. Not now, not ever, never again.

""My name is Luke, Luke Bomberger. The Seagoing program was a opportunity of a lifetime for me. Yes, there were many struggles and hardships but I got through it. You should really join the program it gives you something new to try in life. Also, it helps recover food supplies, animals, and much more for the 44 nations who joined together to make the UNRRA.

There are amazing places you can go to. For intance, we took a trip to Greece. The Acropolis there was something special. In this program there is never a dull moment. You're either taking care of the animals, sight-seeing, being at night watchman. There is also times to have fun. The othercowboys and I have time to play games or do on board such as baseball, volleyball, table-tebbis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, or other games to pass the time.

Since there are struggles to this job I might as well say them too. This job is much more than a adventure, it shows you unbelievable things in this world. My aunt Katie helped me prepare for this. She might not have known it but she did.

The thing is though that I was never prepared of the dangers at sea. It was only my second trip and I served as a night watchman. That night I was to check on the animals every hour and to report to the captain. It was a very rainy night. After I had made my hourly report to him I was sliding down on my backside a slippery ladder. My heart was pounding I was slidding feet first toward an opening on the side of our ship. Luckly a thin strip of metal on the edge of the ship saved me from going to the dark Atlantic ocean.

There are advantages and challenges apart of this job. Some challenges may be risky but if you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you are doing this for a good cause.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you would be to help countries recover from war, recover their food supplies, animals, and more. The UNRRA which is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were being shipped over sea. This is what you would be doing if you joined the Seagoing Cowboys.

While Luke was in the program called Seagoing Cowboys he experienced many amazing sights. He experienced many sights, has been to places,and done many things like go to

Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, and took a gondola ride in Vience, Italy. He also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

I wanted to help people who were affected by the war. Sure, there were many hardships. And at one point I almost died. But it is all worth it. I got to help many people, and I also helped solve the food problem in Europe.

On the boat trips I had to care for many animals, it kept me busy, but it was good to do work. When the animals were unloaded, we would play around in the stalls and play games. It was a good time with my team mates.

I encourage you to be a seagoing cowboy. I had so many good oppurtunities and I helped so many people. I feel blessed to go from country to country and help others in need. If you help, I think you might be surprised at how much you can accomplish in life.              ",2,6,0.7417813539505005
4728682,"Some people say that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be a dull job.

What is a Seagoing Cowboy you ask, well it is a person who delivers cattle to people in need.

It was World War 2 and people around the world needed help with ways to get food.

I felt like I could do something for them, so I decided to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you feel that way then I encourage you to join the Sea Cowboys.

There were many reasons why joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a cool thing and here is one.

For the experinces!

I was a small town boy and had not got to see a lot of the big world that we live in.

The sign up sheet said we would not only help the people in need we would also get to see some of the amazing sights in that country.

That was no lie!

On my journeys I saw the Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and a recently excavated castle in Crete.

I also got to ride in a gondola in Venice, Italy.

Another thing that not many people could say is that you crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice.

Another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you have a chance to serve your country without killing another person.

On my first trip as a Seagoing Cowboy, I turned 18. That is when you are old enough to be drafted to the army.

When the draft board found out I was being a Seagoing Cowboy, they told me to do that as my service.

If you don't like the thought of shooting people, then maybe you could be a Seagoing Cowboy. You would help people get food, not have to shoot anybody, and serve your country.

Now you know some reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

I hope to see you aboard soon.",3,6,0.8815709352493286

I think that they should come because this is a once and a lifetime oppourtunity. The reson that they shoud come is simple they should come because the sights that the town people will miss is astounding. Another reson is they should come because the feel of the free ness

you can have when you do this is magnifisant. The reson you should come is that you get to hang out with your friends like in paragraph 8 Luke said ""The cowboys played baseball and volly ball in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

The most exiting reson that you should come is the sights that you will see like in paragraph 5 when Luck says "" I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and china."" ""This would be a great opportunity for a town boy like me"" he says. The time you spend on the boat will be awsome and the people you will meet and the places you will go will be spectacular.

Another reson would be that you get to help peopel and care for them after this awfull thing that has happned to them. The reson that you should sign up is that you can help them get the things that they need and to travle the world france,greece,china and Europe. The best reson of all that you should go on this journy is that you can get the oppourtunity to be apart of something to help the greater.

I said outloud. I am trying to convince people to join the Seagoing Coybows program. It is a program about helping others in Europe and give them what they need.

I went up to a boy who looked to be about 18. I told him,""How are you?"" He said,""Im doing horrible, I just lost my job at the bar."" I said,""I am very sorry to hear that, but i have something to offer you, by the way how old are you?"" He said, ""I am 19 years old, but what is this offer you are giving me?"" I said, ""Ok thats good, I am a Seagoing Coybow, we are looking for people that want to help others in Europe by giving them what they need."" He said, ""No way, i've been trying to join the program but I missed the singups, im in, also my name is Gavin!""

I said, ""Glad to hear!"" I also said, ""Do you have any friends or family that want to join the program?"" He said, ""I don't know, hmm, maybe my friend Ben?"" I said, ""Great, do you think you can go on my ride and go to his house if he is home?"" He said, ""Yes, he is home right now!"" I said,""How old is he?"" He said, ""He is 23 years old, met him at my job, we were both fighting over something, but we became friends!""

We both rode in my wagon. We made it to his house. I knocked on the door three times no answer. Then when Gavin knocked on the door in a wierd sort of pattern we could hear footsteps. Ben came down he looked big and strong.

I asked him,""Hey Ben, I have met your friend Gavin today, he is going to be joining the Seagoing Coybows program, are you interested in joining?"" He said, ""No sounds dumb."" I said, ""How is it dumb to help people in need?"" He said, ""I don't wanna help just like I said the first time and I don't care! Ben's mom came downstairs.

She yelled, ""Who is it and what do you want with me and my son!"" I said, ""We are just seeing if he is interested in joining a program!"" She ran downstairs and now we saw her. She was tall and had blue eyes with blonde hair. She said, ""What type of program?"" I said, ""The Seagoing Coybows program, I have made 9 trips across the oceans, the most any Seagoing Coybow has, I was recruited in it in 1945 and it is an amzing job, I have been on many amazing adventures and got to visit cool places, you also help people in need!"" She said the same thing that Ben said.

She said, ""There is no point in doing it!"" I said, ""How is it bad to help people in need?"" She said, ""Why should I care?"" Ben said, ""I know right?"" I said, ""What if you were that person in need and needed food,supplies, and transportation?"" ""Wouldn't you want help? She said, ""I guess your right, son you should sing up seems like a great offer to travel places and help people."" Ben said, ""That's dumb, I don't care about them, I care about me, look I need a haircut and you want me to help people instead that I don't care about at all?""

I said,""I will pay for your haircut and it is an amazing offer just like your mom said!"" He said, ""What would you do in the boats?"" I said, ""You would feed and water the animals, but there is also fun things to do like play volleyball,ping pong,fencing,boxing,and reading!"" He said, ""Sounds good I guess I will join!""

I got to help animals recover from World War ll, and this trip was an amazing, and beautiful adventure. This program is hard work, and I know that some people aren't interested in helping animals, or working hard.

But, this is a really good program that I want to tell you about.

Maybe by the end of this article you will be convinced to join this program with me.

What did I have to do on this trip you ask? I had to help animals recover from World War ll.

This was a fun job, because even though this was hard work the animals are fun to play around with. If you don't take this job those animals won't have any body to take care or play around with them.

I know some of you don't really care for animals, but what's better: watching you favorite Tv show or helping poor animals recover from World War ll ?

The animals are a great part of this experience, but do you want to know what I really loved about this trip? I adored all of the tourist attractions on my way to China, and the great experience this was.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable for a small-town boy like me.

Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

I loved the gondola ride in Venice Italy, it was beautiful to see the streets of water.

When I toured that excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China, it was amazingly beautiful.

I was bored with my high school job, so I took this job.

I was not bored anymore.

This job is a great job for someone who loves adventures, sand a hard working job.

I sure hope that this essay has convined you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because my arm sure is getting tired from all this writting.

Like I said in the first paragragh, work might not be for some people, or some people might not like animals.

But I am telling you this program is worth the work, with the amazing places you see, and sailing on a boat while taking care of animals.

Hopefully, you will join the Seagoing Cowboys program with me, and if you do this program it will open up the world to you, and you will be writting the next essay to someone.  ",2,6,0.7292916774749756

Sea Going Cowboys Program!

I am Luke Bomberger, a seagoing cowboy. I am part of a big program known as the UNRRA who has hired seagoing cowboys. The UNRRA

allows us to help the countires who have been destroyed by war. I take care of the animals over sea and it is amazing to care for them and be known as a seagoing cowboy. Join me to help the others. Here are some reasons why you should become a seagoing cowboy.

First reason, this program is not for fun. It is for the people who are devastated right now in life. They just had to deal with with World War II. This war left many countries to pieces. The animals needed to be taken care of so that is where the seagoing cowboys come in. The seagoing cowboys care for the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Another reason, the seagoing cowboys are pleasured with free time to see beautiful sights and views. I got to see Europe,China,Italy and Greece. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece and take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. This is just a really nice way to enjoy myself while helping out the world in a good way as well. Lastly, we have fun on board with fellow seagoing cowboys. we will play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. This helps us pass time on board the sea.

Being a seagoingcowboy is dedication. It is hard work. It is fun and beautiful. Being a seagoing cowboy means you are helping the animals and the world in a wonderful way. You get to care for animals, see beautiful sights, play fun games, and help the people who just had to suffer from world War II.                                            ",3,6,0.896449089050293

When I was a Seagoing Cowboy I did those things. Being a Seagoing Cowboy means that you would have to be on a cattle-boat going to different places.

On the cattle-boat I had to take care of some animals. I took care of horses,young cows (calfs),and mules. Sometimes, I have to check on the animals every hour as a night watchman. I have to feed the animals two or three times a day. I had to clean the animal stalls too.

On the trip, I would get free time. When I get free time I found some fun things to do. I did these things:table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. Other Cowboys played baseball and volleyball I played those too.

While sailing I went to lots of places. I went to places like Venice,Italy and China. Going places is part of being a Seagoing Cowboy. I went to places in Europe too.

In summary, I took care of animals,played games,and went to different places all around the world. It takes some work to be a Seagoing Cowboy but,it is worth it.

If you think that some of these things may interest you than keep reading and see what it was really like to be apart of this excellent program.

Being on the Seagoing Cowboys program is not just anything, but for a small-town boy, like me, this is an amazing opportunity.

Besides just helping the people of other countries, I also got to see Europe and China, they are actually pretty amazing places to visit too!

If you have ever had a dream to see places such as these than this is the right program for you to join.

While traveling the high seas, it took me about two weeks to get from the United states to China, although caring for the animals kept me busy.

Some of the jobs that we have to do here are to: care for the animals, pull bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower hold of the ship, and clean the animal's stalls.

In order to be able to uphold the standards, you would have to be a pretty focused and responsible person. That is something that would have to be in your personality in order to do this job efficiently and correctly.

During some of your free time, sometimes my cowboy friends and I found that we can still have some fun onboard.

We had the chance to play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been unloaded.

Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and lots of other games helped pass time too.

See, even though you have lots of daily responsibilities during this program, you can also have some fun every once and a while too!

Joining the sea cowboys is a way to go on many journeys through out your lifetime. It is a way to learn different types of animals and, since I used to work on a farm I can help you feed the animals if you need any help. Even though im above 18 I still want to stay on the program with all of the new followers but, I did have to be drafted in 1947.

When I was traveling across the sea I got to see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, Crete, and Panama Canal on my way to China. I had very rough times at night watchmen, one time I was going to go and feed the animals and I fell down the slippery stairs, it didn't hurt to bad but I did feel alot of pain. We also had a fun time on board playing baseball and volleyball. After all of the animals had been feed and put to bed we also played table-tennis, boxing, fencing, reading, and whitling. As the time went by it is always ttime to go to bed because when we were playing the games time had been flying.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys was a great decision. After I had quit my two half-time jobs, banking and working at a grocery store my friend Don had asked if I wanted to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It was as fun as it gets having a friend aboard that I was able to talk to. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys was a great opportunity to help me see everyone elses needs in other countries.

One reason someone should becoome a sea cowboy is because you get to do a lot of sightseeing. I got to go to China, Greece, Venice, and Crete. In China, there was great sightseeing. So many things to tour and look at, and i got to see the Panama Canal while heading there. It was beautiful.

I aslo got to go to Greece, as i have already told you, and got to see the Acropolis. Greece was by far the best place i went. It is one of the spectaclals of being a sea cowboy. If you aren't a sea cowboy then its likely that you will never see the things i got to see.

In Venice, the streets where made of water, or atleast people traveled by canals of water. The people of Venice had to be good at controling boats to do that because i tried, and fell in the water. You get to do some unique things as a sea cowboy, such as the things i just described to you.

Crete was the second best, because i got to see the Panama Canal. I couldn't say enough that it was beautiful. With its wide mouth and trees every where, you don't see that every day unless you're a sea cowboy.

There may be a big wait to get to those places, but its worth the wait. Hey, that reminds me of the time i almost died at sea. If you like risks, you'll love being a sea cowboy. Back to the time i almost died at sea. I was walking on deck, just back from checking the animals, and i sliped on a ladder below me. I started sildeing down the side of the boat, and caught on a peice of metal. That peice of metal saved my life. I did end up with a few broken ribs, but i was ok.

Did i mention the animals, almost 400 hundred animals each trip. The best part of it is being with the animals. I get to feed them, clean them, and water them. Some of the animals you get to see are some of the ones that might start to feel connected to. I got to keep a horse that i loved. Another great thing about being a sea cowboy.

The night watch is like a job you have to check on the animals every hour to make sure their okay. But the night watch could be scary one time I fell and cracked my ribs.

There are also some fun things you can do on the ship once you drop of the animals. When you returning from dropping of the animals you can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Ping-Pong tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that helped pass time on the boat.

The animals on the ship were pigs, sheep, chickens, cows, roosters, horses, and goats. The most liked animal was the horses because they were nice and the fur was very soft. Every time at night you could here the animals for a litlle then they would finaly settle down.

One rainy night after making my hourly report to the captain I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal aalong the edge stopped my slide keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Antlantic.

I found time to have fun on board,especially                                                                                                                                                         ",2,6,0.6695051789283752

When you join the Seaging Cowboys, you will get to see much of the world like I did.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is it is lots of fun, especially after the animals have been unloaded.

It's not just working with animals, feeding, and watching over them. You have lots of fun playing games like baseball, volleyball, and boxing.

I had turned 18 before I had arrivede at Gresse, so that meant I could be drafted for military service, but when my draft board had leanred I was on a cattle-boat trip be just told me to keep doing what I was doing. In the service you help people and help to fight for your country and if he told me to keep doing what I was doing that means I'm doing something that is going to help people in a big way. The cargo is going to help feed people in need because of the war destroying their food supplies. Not only did I help people, I also got to see Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Also taking a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy was amazing too! The city with streets of water was beautiful. I also go to tour an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

On theses trips I got to meet new people and see new places. I got to help people in need, and that felt good. It feels good when you see someone that's suffering because their home was destroyed and when you help them they have a smile on their face. Taking care of the cattle, horses, and mules was fun.

So Luke and Dan helped all of the animals and got the better. Luke was happy because he also got to see the Acropolis in

Greece and he also got to take a gondola ride in Venice.

When luke ws almost arriving in Greece he turned 18 which meant he could be drafted in the military services. When Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle-boat trip they said why don't you just keep doing that for his service.When Luke was part of the cattle-boat trip it was an unbelievable opportunity for someone like him. He said ""besides helping people he got to see Europe and China. The exciting part was that he got to go to Greece and see the Acropolis and go on the gondola ride in Venice.

Luke got a job as a night watchman. His job was to check on the animals at night time. When he had the job as a night watchmen he slid down the slippery slide on his backside and cracked some of his ribs so he couldn't do his job for a couple of days. Luke said ""it made him more aware of

people of other countries and their needs.",3,6,0.7212824821472168
4e38e77,"Luke Bomberger had an opportunity of a lifetime after his high school graduation, his friend asked him if he would like to join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"". Luke could not say no so, although it maybe dangerous, I am sure that there are alot of reason why. Here are some of the reasons why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"".

The first and main reason why you should join is because, it would bring wonderful sightseeing opportunities and you would get to visit many new places that you wouldn't get to visit otherwise. Luke got to travel all over Europe, in my opinion almost everywhere in Europe is beautiful and has wonderful landscape so, I would probably go just for that reason. The next reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is, besides all of the hard work you also have freetime to do many fun activities such as baseball, volleyball, table-tenis, fencing, boxing, whittling, and reading to pass the time. In my opinion besides the labor involved, in a way it would almost be like sailing on a cruise ship. Finally, the final and by far most important reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because, it opens up your eyes to the world and the needs of others. Being a part of this program opened up Luke's eyes so much that for many years after, his family hosted quite a few exchange visitors and international students for some time after his incredible experience.

Those were just a few of the many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. If you love adventure and want to serve your country and other countries to then join today. It will truely be an unforgetable experience that I promise you'll never forget.",3,6,0.861763596534729
4e4164d,"Luke wants other people to join the seagoing cowboy program. He wants people to join it so that persons life would change. From the world war 2 he wants to help the people that doesnt have enough food or their house got destroyed. It will help you because when we are done giving our will to that person he or she will want to help other people too. Also he could take care of any animal that is damaged or hurt and he will take care of them when they are shipped overseas. It will be an opportunity of a lifetime for your animal because we will treat them well and give them enough food for them to survive. When you see people treating the animals they will want to be part of the group so he can help other people or animals.

It will be an opportunity of a lifetime because you get to travel overseas and probably see the place that you always dreamed of going to. Also you might want to have the animal you were taking care of because you worked hard on taking care of it. Maybe when your children grow up they will want to be part of the Seagoing Cowboy program. You will be having alot of fun because you get to see some amazing things that you never seen in your life. Also you get to take a gondola ride in Venice, italy you cant say no to that.

When you return from the trip overseas you will never forget about it because you will want to tell the whole world about how much fun you had. When you tell the people how much fun you had hey will want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Also on the trip back home you unload all the animals you can play volleyball games and other games that will help pass the time. Also you will always remember the trip of a lifetime ",3,6,0.7859979867935181
4e5f9f7,"Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is the best thing to join. The program has been around since 1945 after World War ll was over in Europe. At this time many countries were left to pieces. To help these countries 44 nations joined together to from the UNRRA. UNRRA then hired the Seagoing Cowboys program to help them out. In my essay, I will say some reasons why joinging the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great idea.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is fun and you get to meet new people and try new things.The program gives you the chance to see many different parts of the world. Without signing up to join the program you probably would never this chance again. Also, you get to have a lot of fun with new people you meet along the way. Another benifit that the program offers is you get to see many other cultures and you get to try new foods. This program offers many great things.

The Seagoing Cowboys program offers great opportunities to many people. You get the opportunity to take care of many different animals, which is always a joy. You get to help people in need which is a special thing you get to do. There are many other benifits to being in the Seagoing Cowboys program, but here are just a few that are the most exicting.

I know that some people think that feeding animals on a boat all the time is not fun. However, in your free time you get to tour many places where you visit to sight see. One time I got to go to Greece and saw a beautiful Acropolis. So this option lets you not be bored because you are feeding animals while on a boat.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great program to join. You have fun while helping others and yet still enjoying what you are doing. Overall the program offers many great opportunities and is a lot of fun.           ",4,6,0.8384984731674194

I would go because it would be an amazing adventure. You would learn so many things that you would normaly not learn as an average high school student. World War 2 just ended in Europe. You want to see the aftermath of some of the cities are.

Every city that he stopped at, he could go to a cool muesuem or go somewhere amazing in that city. Every 18 year old would rather go to Greece than staying at school working on worksheets. Luke and Don got to take care of animals. They also took care of people who didn't have a lot of advantages.

Wouldn't you want to play some fun sports with you friend. Think about your favorite sport. You could play any of those sports. From baseball to table-tennis. You could have a really fun time. There were more things that they did to pass time. If you were tired you could sit in the shade and read you favorite book that you brought.

This would be somebodys dream to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join the program today. You can also invite one of your friends just like Don Reist did to Luke. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.                ",3,6,0.5645925998687744

You should join the program, because it helps the lost animals. Another reason is you get to explore more of the world and meet new animals. When you are bored or have nothing to do for a while just join the Seagoing Cowboys. If you do this it would be generous to the animals who did go through all of this pain. That is just a few reasons to join just think of the other posibilities you can do to help animals.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The UNRRA hired us and we need to help them. You get to help lost and injured animals either in the ocean or on land.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means he could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay.

Luke had to take care of all the horses it was his job. It was no big deal though when he was a little kid his aunt made him work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case he did work in a farm in future and look he is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip he was a night watchman. All he had to do was check on the animals every single hour.

Luke loved being a Seagoing cowboy it was more than he ever wanted. He had some scary moments but you have to face some fear.

It is to help Europe and the many other countries recover from world war II.So 44 nations join together for the seagoing cowboys. Not only is this trip a adventure its an opportunity to do something good for others. So instead of sitting at home and doing nothing maybe you should come. This trip made me aware of people in other countries that are in need. This one trip will want to make you do more for the homeless and do more for people in need. It took me two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean if i can do it you can do it to. There is no reason that a short amount of people went you should have went. imagine if you were those people in Europe and the other countries i bet you would want people to come and help you. You cant be a selfish person these people fought for thier countries and whille they were fighting all they had was destroyed. A lot of people died that night what if it was your brother or sister that got shot trying to fight for their country.

Im glad i was there with my friend or I wouldn't of made it, because he kept me going. Finnaly I suggest everyone try out being Seagoing Cowboys.

During my first trip I left August 14 1945 with cows, goats, supplies, and weaponry. It was a dangerous trip but we kept pushing because the army needed supplies. When we arrived the Pacific war ended but another was still blazing. The old war ended in ruins and bodys.

The UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabitation Administration) created this idea of taking supplies over seas. Many didn't sign up, but me and Don did and turns out it was alot of fun. On the return we played alot of sailing games to pass time. when we delieved the supplies there were no animals in the ship so we had time to setup thing like whittling, table-tennis, and boxing, but theres alot more, like fencing.

The sights in Europe are amazing there's China and The Great Wall of China. In Greece theres the Acropolis. I also took a gondala to Venic, Italy. I also toured a castle in Crete. Finnaly I marvelled at the watery canels in Panama. In the end i saw alot of crazy things in Europe and China.

After my trip I can say it was amazing and you can have the same experience. Just sign up for Seagoing Cowboys. There's animals so if you like animals there on the boat. If your althelic you can help care to the animals and play the return games. If you love water, well we are on a boat and you can fish.

If you do not believe that you will have the time of your life then you will not believe all the beautful places or imagtheant. You may not want to come because you do not believe in what I say to be true. ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelivable opptuntiy for a small-town boy"", like myself.

The fun bit is when you get to take care of the animals or when the animals had been unloaded and the space where the animals used to be are free, you can go there, and play games like baseball,volleyball, table-tennis, fancing, and boxing or read a good, nice (or not so nice)

books.

Me, being in the Seagoing Cowboys program reccomend you to join for three reasons. By participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program, you will be able to see unique places that some people might not have the opportunity to do so.

And so to start, I get that some people don't want to go out, or maybe they already travel the world - but, I will promise you, it's worth seeing. Some of the unique places include, well, water! Most of the trips you might be taking is going to be focused on water, and by saying that, I just hope that you may be at least a bit intrested in joining at this point. This will prove, that be joining, you will see new and unique places.

Secondly, another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it's loads of fun. Feeding the animals may be a hard task, but it sure frees you form some of the bordom on the boat or ship. Yes, some people don't like animals, and I get that, but it doesn't mean that they won't have even a bit of fun, there's so much more for you to explore if you just look! You can go and kill some time with the animals, and feed them when needed. At night, if you're assigned to the animals, you have to go check on them every hour. It really does seem like alot, but I don't think that anybody would want an animal, or animals, around the ship lurking around, messing up peoples things. This demonstrates that you should join because you're bound to have some fun.

And lastly, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because not many people will get the chance to do all the things that you may be able to do if you just try and give this a chance. People won't, and I respect you. But, with that being said, just stick with me for just a bit, and you'll see why you should join. Some of the things we do you can't do on a normal day. You don't always get to stay up all night to feed and watch animals, and you don't always get to go out into sea for months. This definitly proves that you will be able to try some new things that you normally won't do.

In the seagoing Cowboys program, you'll be able to see new and amazing places, have some fun, and try to do some new things you won't be able to do normally.

It may sound like a lot of work but is can be very rewarding. On my many trips as a seagoing cowboy, I was able to spend a lot of my time with friends and was able to do some sightseeing in other countries. I was also able to learn a lot about animals just from taking care of them. I hope that you choose to become a seagoing cowboy.

One reason for becoming a seagoing cowboy would be that you would learn a lot about animals. I was able to learn a lot of body language from the animals. I now know when an animal is nervous or angry. I can tell when a horse is calm and happy. Knowing animal body language may help you not get a broken bone from being kicked by an angry horse or cow. You will also learn how to take care of the animals. I already knew how to take care of some of the animals from working on my aunt's farm, but I learned how to care for animals a lot faster from doing it hundreds of times everyday.

Another reason that was fun about becoming a seagoing cowboy was that I was able to spend a lot of time with my friends on the trip back to America. All of my friends and I loved playing sports, like volleyball and table-tennis, in the empty holds where we kept the animals. We also shared stories and games that some of us had never even heard of. I learned many fun stories and games that I now pass on to others today.

My last reason to convince you to become a seagoing cowboy would be the sightseeing. While we were in another country, we had some time to go sightseeing. I was able to tour an excavated castle in Crete. I took a gondala ride in Italy and saw the Panama Canal. I also learned a lot about culture. I learned how bad things can be in other countries after wars. It made me more aware of the people and their needs in other countries.

I loved the opportunity to become a seagoing cowboy, even if it was for a short period of time. I was able to learn animal body language and more about how to take care of the animals. I was able to see many great things like the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. I also learned about culture in many other countries and some of the hardships of living there. The trips made me more aware of the hardships every person in other countries face every, single day of their lives. I hope that all of these reasons convinced you to become a seagoing cowboy.

Now you see all the fun things they do and you get payed lot of money and I know it don't say that in the text but I can tell because they explore around the world like Luke said.Luke had went to

Europe , China , and Acropolis and many other places . And you can get some thing to have a idea of this place again and tell your family . You can also see all the pretty thing at the new places to you and learn new thing if you let yourself you can learn something ever day .

It's also very easy to become stressed and overwheled by work and school;its just best to take a break for it all.

This is what many people had to here and go through during World War 11. People lost there homes, are going without food and water, and are injured, sick, or dead. Now luckily the war is over but people still don't have what they need to survive. This is the reason why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help those in need.

My first reason is, the reasons why you are needed to help these people. World War 11 was a terrible war between almost every army in the world. It left hundreds of thousands of people homeless, injured, dead, sick, and without any food and war like i said before. This is why after the war the UNRRA ( The United Nations Relief and Rehab. Administration ) started the Seagoing Cowoys program and is another reason why you should join to help these people. Not to mention how if your under the age of 18 or recently turned 18 the program counts as your military service. You need to join so you could also save lives. Imagine it being a relative of yours in need that was in need after the war you would probably help but those people have families to and they need you and thats why u should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Another reason is, all the benefits of helping in the Seagoing Cowboys program. one reason is you wouldn't have to endure the danger of the military as for the program counts as military service which I have also told you before. This is not all because on the way back from your trips you enjoy the marvelous once in a lifetime chance to sightsee the places you've always dreamed of seeing in Europe. The last benefit is being able to enjoy and savor the moment of helping people in need as they thank and as you know you have done good for not only your country but the whole planet.

Lastly, I think before you accept the job you should know more about it. For this job you will be asked to use go on a ship for long periods of time with crewmen and animals to care for. You will have to feed and give water to the animals two to tthree times a day, clean their stalls, and trasport the safely to the destination. You may also have the responsibility of night duty where you protect and guid the ship and warn of storms and check on the animals every hor. You will then transfer this info. to the captain.

You get to help people all around the world. The Seagoing Coyboys take care of the horses, young cows, & mules that were shipped over seas. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, & more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations

Relief & Rehabilitation Administration).

For exaple, my friend Don Reist & I went to Europe to help. It was 1945, World War II was over it Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

You get to sight see when you have the time. You get to take once in a lifetime trips around the world. It's also fun abord the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals have been unloaded.

The cowboys and I played baseball & volleyball games. We also did; table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, & games to help pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy opens up the world to you.

You should especially join if you like to see ancient artifacts such as an old castle is Crete and even the Panama Canal.

The down sides of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will have to travel far from home and stay away from your family for long periods of time and you wouldn't get to see them much.

Those are some resons that you should join the organization because like I said it would be such an opportunity for you and your family. Make sure you join if you would like to see cool things, meet unique people, and just have fun, but if you don't like staying away from home you shouldn't join because you will have to stay for long periods of time.

You will travel all across the country. In the pasage it states that, when Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldnt resist. It was a opportunity of his life time. Once they left Europe they recived their orders to report to New Orleans. They boerded the SS Charles W. Wooster, that was headed for Greece.

They will give you a chance to do things you would've never thought of going before. In the passage it states, Luke had made 9 trips. When they saw the Acropolis in Greece that was speical to them. They also took a gondola ride in Veince, Italy, A city with streets of water. Luke was excited to get a chance to ride in a cattle boat. Luke states in the passage, ""the cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy, besides helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

You will get a chance to change your life. In the passage it states that, luke graduated high school and was working two part-time jobs ina grocery store and a bank. Now instead of working two-part time jobs Luke is now on a cattle boat traveling to China, Greece and Europe. From helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work for what ever hed did. Being a Seagoing Cowbow was much more than an advantage for luke Bomberger.

In Venice, we went gondola riding.

We also did many fun activities in our spare time. Us Cowboys play baseball and volleyball. We also had table-tennis tournaments, we fenced, boxed, read, and we played many other games. Not only do we do these activities, but we also liked to whittle.

The Seagoing Cowboys didn't just do fun activities and have adventures, but we also had many responsibilities. There are different types of responsibilities that the Seagoing Cowboys have to do. One of these responsibilities is that we all took turns nightwatching. What a nightwatcher does is they have to check on the animals every hour and make hourly reports to the captain. We also had to feed and water the animals two or three times every day.

You should fully consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you do, you can see so many new thing and experience many things you have always wanted to experience. While I was on my first trip when Don invited I almost died but only because it was a very rainy night.

I turned 18 before arriving Greece, which meant I could be drafted into the military.

You help people in need and still have time for games and sightseeing on your way!

As an addition, you can be a Seagoing Cowboy as your military service.

There are so many perks to being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Let me tell you about some.

As said in Paragraph Two of this article about me and my adventures as a Seagoing Cowboy called ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"", ""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

My friend Don Reist and I joined.

We were to take care of the animals on board the ship so that people that need them could be helped.

But it wasn't all work.

I even said myself, as this article states, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

Taking a gondola ride in Venice and seeing the Acropolis in Greece were both truly amazing.

Paragraph Eight of this article tells all about the games we would play on the ship.

It reads, ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.""

This is all very true information.

The cowboys and I would always have so much fun.

You can do all of this when you join the Seagoing Cowboys!

Yet another perk is being able to be a Seagoing Cowboy as your military service.

This article qoutes me in Paragraph Four, and I said, ""When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""

In conclusion, there are many perks to joining the Seagoing Cowboys, from simply helping people to sightseeing.

There are already many Seagoing Cowboys, and all of them would be so grateful for more members.

A seacowboy is a person who get's to go on cattle-boat trips which is an unbelievable opportunity for small-town boys. You could possible end up seeing Europe, maybe even China one day. It usually takes about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United states, and a month to get to China, but hey it's all up to the water and weather. Being a seacowboy can be very dangerous, because with all the storm that you could get cought in can be REALLY dangerous, and very unsafe, but in the end it is really fun, because you get to see all kinds of different thing like wild life, different countries, etc.

So if you ever want to be a seacowboy i wouldn recomend bringing a wetsuit, lots of water and food, some extra cloths, and a camera to hold all of the memories for when you go to go on a work trip. So get those pen, pencils, paper, etc. because i think your going to go to college for a very special, and amazing job. :)",2,6,0.6880338788032532
5531c2d,"I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it a really good program. You will see lots of different things that you probabaly have never seen before. Wouldn't that be cool? I was one and it was a lot of fun. You get to meet new people and see new things.

Some things that are a downside are when you are on the ship and a storm comes you have to make sure everything is latched shut and close everything. You also have to make sure that no one or nothing gets thrown overboard. It almost happened to me once, I was a watchman on my second trip. My job was to check on all of the animals every hour. Well, one night I was doing just that and I slid down a slippery ladder. I thought that I was going to go overboard, my heart was racing as I shot feet first toward a big opening in the side of the ship. I thought I was going to die, but I didn't obviously cause I'm still here talking to you. Well, a small metal strip stopped my slide, keeping me from going overboard. It was the best moment of my life when that metal strip saved me.

Now that that is over with I am goign to tell you some amazing places you might be able to go. These trips where amazing for a small town boy like me. I would have so much fun in the places that we would go. Most people thought that it was just work, work, work, but in all of reality it was some work and some play. Once I went to the Panamal Canal on my way to China. that was really fun. Another time I went to Greece. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece and that meant that I could be drafted fo rmilitary service. I wanted to, but when the draft board found out I was on a cattle-boat trip, thet told me to keep doing that for my service.

Sometimes we wouldn't have anything to do on the return trips so we would play games like baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals were housed. We would play fencing and boxing, sometimes even table-tennis and whittling.

Also we would read. These games where used to pass time because we had a lot of it.

In conclusion, I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. There might be some scary moments, but there are definetly some fun ones too. It is a really good program to just start a military career. You might even go on as many trips as me and if you do I will pray for you cause it is a lot of work.",5,6,0.7028447389602661

If you like to travel then you'll love to be a part of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to travel the world on a boat.

A benifit was I had the chance to see Europe and China. If you join you will probably get to see plenty of new beautiful places you haven't seen before.

Also

the view when your on the boat is just magnificent.

When your a seagoing cowboy you will be helping people who had damage from World War II by giving them cattle.

This helps them because these places took serious damage from world war II.

Europe and China probbably had most of their cattle killed so we help by giving them horses young cows and

and mules so they can have milk and meat.

These cattle will also provide them with clothing to wear.

I took care of the cattle in my years of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

So if you like to help people and keep animals calm then you might be intrested.

My last and final reason you should be apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you get down time and you get to explore the area.

If you you're in one of those jobs that gives you no downtime and sll you do is work I suggest you quit and join us.

While i was a Seagoing Cowboy we stopped in Greece and I saw the Acropolis.

This was a breath taking sight.

In your downtime youmight be able to see

some amazing sights also.

you'll get to see thing like you've never seen before.

In clonclusion you should become part of the Sea going Cowboys program because you get to travel the world, help people that had damge from World War II and comfort the cattle that your shipping to them, and you get downtime to explore where you are and see breathtaking sights.

If you do join i might be able to teach you more about being a Seagoing Cowboy. I hope you'll consider joining.",4,6,0.8950949907302856

Being in that group is a very big responsibility, and chance to show others what you can do and what you are capable of. ""When I started playing football a lot of peoel thought i wasnt gonna be able to do it and they though that i would get hurt and break a bone and not even be on the field as much as i wanted. But it turned out that the coach put me in a position that no one would ever expect from a girl, The QB. My friends and famiy then knew what i was capable of donig."" You just have to show them what you can do and prove it to them.

I am a very brave man that decided to do the job that I am doing now becuase its kind of like the story in the bible. There are a bunch of animals in a boat on water, floating across the sea. There are many bad things that could happen that you might not even see coming from a mile away. The job that I am doing now is a VERY risky job that not a lot of pepole are brave enough to do for them selfs. You have to be very tallented and brave to walk over here and get on a boat not knowing what is gonna happen.

To be one of there people you have to be physicaly and mentaly prepared for what is coming your way, you can never tell what is gonna happen in the future so you alawys have to be prepared for it. Luke probably had a lot of bad things that happened to him like when there was a bad storm one night and he was climbing the ladder to get to the captin and he slipped and fell and broke som of his ribs. If you think that that is bad then when you get into the job you better be prepared be a lot more sever things can happen to you while you are on that boat, you might never be able to tell what is coming your way.

If you think that you are prepared please come and join the Seagoing Cowboys Program , I promise that you will never regret the decission that you make. The program will have a lot of trainning for the peolpe that might have no other way of getting in shape where they are now. But if you are realling wanting to join makes sure you are in good shape, physicaly and mentaly and come hop on a boat with us and take a trip across the sea. ",2,6,0.6707431077957153

He was always buisy trying to help people with banking and shopping with in his home town. Really what he didn't know was that he was going to be helping all kinds of people around the world a long ways from his town. So when Don Reist invited him to go he knew that was a chance to really help other people and get more money.

Luke Bomberger knew that he could visit lots of places. He actually got to visit a,""castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China"". He got to do things he would'nt have been able to do in his old town. After World War ll in 1945, lots of people were left with nothing and did'nt have food to care for everyone. So with the help of the,""Seagoing Cowboys"",they would help transport animals to those places so they could have food to live.

I think more people should join this program because it gives others a chance to live and survive after wild events like wars. Many people in the world work as doctors and vets for those who live around them. But they also have the chance to help people far away who need it. Not only that but they can still work with animals. It may not be dogs and cats they are working with but they can still help animals and other people.

Luke enjoyed being apart of the program because he knew he had the chance to visit many polular places. So I think that instead of planning a vaction to go the beach you can go other places that you may not have been to before rather than going to the same places everytime. When you think of being someone that transports animals across seas you don't normally think of being a doctor. But really what people don't think about is that when they give animals to people the animals are recorce for food which helps people that may be sick or need to food because they don't have animals near. So its important to everyone.

Really the big idea to this program is that people reliey on animals and their recorces. But its very hard for people to have to leave there town to find food and bring that back for everyone. So this program is very important to others because they know people will care for them when they need it. It's also very good education when you visit places like unwealthy towns so you can get a feel of what it's like for them and how much they need people like us.

I will feel sad for missing out on the oppurtunity.

Seagoing Cowhboys started out when the UNRRA started because the UNRRA wanted them to take care of the horses,young cows, and mules that were to be shipped overseas. If they shipped the animals overseas to a place they would get of the boat and go have some fun by doing a lot of activites. When the Seagoing cowboys went to Venice, Italy they rode and gondola because the streets are filled with water. when they went to Crete he toured and excavated catsle and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

second trip, I served as a night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night ,after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down the ladder and cracked his ribs.

There are very many sights to see, such as, taking relaxing gondola rides in Venice, touring excavated sites like the elegant castles in Crete, seeing the famous Acropolis in Greece. There are many more exotic and beautiful structures to be seen as a Seagoing Cowboy. Along the way gift shops and antique stores that can be visited and bought from.

Places like China are availible to visit and see. The program has all of these offers as well as delivering all of the animals that are on board with you. This is an even greater opportunity to young men who have just come out of high school, it can open things up for them. Help them realize and be aware, that there are other people who have needs in other countries. After it's all over, you can take another trip if you wish to.

Being a sea cowboy means more than just moving animals from place to place. It helps others in need, people who have nearly nothing. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can make all the difference. That is why being part of the Seagoing Cowboys program is a good career choice.                ",3,6,0.7600890398025513
5801bab,"From what I have just read, a few reasons that would help persuade someone to join the Seagoing Cowboys program would be to Tell them a life story. This would be persuasive because if you had been to the program, you coud tell people about how you helped your country and how you were a brave hero they might also want to be able to help their country and join the program. I can support my claim because in the text it tells us that Luke and Don were traveling to Europe and World War II had just happned there so Luke and Don had signed up to be Seagoing Cowboys to help deliver food and water and live stock to Europe.

Another reason people should join the program is because It's lots of fun to be on board! I can support my evidence because in the text it tells us that while Luke was on board, the cowboys played baseball, volleyball, and games in the empty holds where the animals used to be housed. It also tells us that table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittiling, and other games also helped pass the time.

One of the final ways you could persuade folks to join the program is that while serving, you can also go sight-seeing! The text evience i used was from paragraph 5. The text tells me that besides helping people, Luke also got to see the Acropolis is Greece, took a gondola ride through Venice,Italy, toured the castle in Crete, and marvled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

This is what i belive to be the most effective ways to persuade people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program and how to tell them in a posotive way that this helps you to meet new people, protect your country, and go sight-seeing all why having a great time.      ",3,6,0.8203127384185791

The reason i think it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagong program is because I just got done reading a artical called,'' A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,''.And in this story the author gave me many reasons on why it would be a great idea to participate in the program.

The first reason on why it would be great is if u enjoy caring fo animals then the Seagoing Cowboys program is the place for you. The reason i say this is because the UNRRA hired''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Another reason on why it would be a great idea is the experience to visit many unique places,for example if u like to travel and visit places you can have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China or even better you can see the special sight of the Acropolis in Greece. Also you can take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,which is a city with streets of water. Another great thing about it is that you can tour a excavated castle in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on your way to China. But if your lazy and non disaplined i dont think this is a good trip for you because you have to be prepared for hard work .

One other reason on why it would be a great idea is because if you like to have fun and enjoy yourself than this would be great for you because you can find time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

If you like animals or if you take care of animals then this is the thing for you because you get to take care of animals so that way they can get to where they are going safely. Plus if you have never done it before, it would be a pretty cool experience because you also get to feed the animals on the boat ride and you get to give them something to drink.

This would also be a fun and creative program because you get to do cool thing like watch dolphins and fish and all of the other sea creatures swim. The way that this would be a creative program is because you could make up names for the animals. In the text it says, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.""

Do you like traveling, caring for animals, and helping others? Then, the Seagoing Cowboys program is just for you. Luke Bomberger, one of the members, loves his experience with the Seagoing Cowboys. He has done so many things to help the people in need of desperate help. Seagoing Cowboys help others, have to take care of animals, and people who join get to travel often.

First, this program helps others who are in need of help. Some may say, neighbors in their neighborhood could help them. However, some of the people the program has helped were just in a feirce war, you can't even tell it was once a beautiful neighborhood. The progam helped people in Europe just after World War II. I belive the program is really thoughtful, even to people in other countries.

Secondly, the program takes care of animals. Others may believe, they don't need to take care of the animals to help the humans. On the other hand, the animals provide meat, milk, and eggs. The animals will also provide clothing to the humans, the sheep give them wool. I infer animals are really useful animals and good to take care of.

Lastly, people who join travel often. Others may say, you might get injured with all the wars going on. However, most people who go arrive after the war ends so saftey is not a problem. The only time you might get hurt is when you mess around on the ship. This shows, traveling is not a problem, unless you get seasick.

The Seagoing Cowboys program helps others, take care of animals, and they get to travel often.

The people that go on this cattle boat are there to help countries that were left in ruins of World War II.This is a gruop to form the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rebelion Administration). This group of people has 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA.

That why we want you to join bacause it's a great group to join and it can get better starting with you.

My favorite part of being a Seagoing Cowboy would probably be helping people. I went out and looked for people in distress. I tried to help them as best as possible. I adored helping people even before I joined this group so I loved this part.

When I wasn't helping people I would treat my self to some site seeing. I loved seeing the Acropolis in Greece. That was my favorite! I also saw Europe, China, I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, I saw an excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canal.

I also had a few scary times like one time I was just about to fall overboard on my night-watch, but this little piece of metal stopped me.

When I was on my way home and we had already loaded off all of the animals, I would play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. I also read!

I kept going on these amazing trips and now I feel as if I have been everywhere! I'm sure that if you take this offer and join the Seagoing Cowboys then you will have plenty of stories to tell children and relatives.

Something that is really cool and I love to do, is go sight seeing when we drop of the animals. Since we go a lot of places to give animals away, there is a lot of things to see. That is something that is always fun, if you love going to foreign countries to see things. Like the time I went Crete and and explored an excavated castle.

You are always on a boat, so you can't be scared of boats or the water and you can't be a person who gets sea sick a lot. That's not the only thing you have to mind, though. Because we are taking animals overseas, there is alot of animals to take care of, like 335 horses, plus we have to have enough hay and oats to feed them. It can be a stinky, dirty job, too. You don't really have to be good with animals, though. You just have be good at remembering and giving them food and water up to three times a day. But it would also help if you were good with them, so then you wouldn't scare them. If you are strong then great! We would need you to carry a lot of bahles of hay and bags of oats onto the boat.

Just think, sailing all around the world! You can see places and go to places that you've always wanted to go. If you're thinking like, oh! They don't need me. They've already got enough hands on board!, then you better think again. We can always use a new person to help us.",4,6,0.7187047004699707

5bd28b9,"Reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program are so many! Take Luke for a example, He got to explore and see Europe and Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and crossed the Pacific Ocean twice!

Also,Luke didn't just have fun for himself,he also helped people who were affected by World War II. The group that helped those runied countries and affected people were UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Where Luke comes in is when the UNRRA needed people to take care of horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to do that job. After hearing about that Luke and his friend Don signed up. Also its not boring on the ship full of animals because the cowboys could do the following;baseball,vollyball,table-tenis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling and games. Luke went on many amazing places such as the Acropolis in Greece,taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,Luke toured the excavated castle Crete,and marvled at the Panama Canal on his way to China,plus that was his only favorite places not all the places he went so you can imagine all of the places you could go!

There so many possibilites you can do with this wonderful job. You can make new friends and see all new places you could never imagine,and even start a new and exciting life.   ",2,6,0.8651226758956909

The Seagoing Cowboys go from country to country helping them restore their crops and animals. And while your on the boat, you get to look after animals such as horses, cows, and even mules!

You should join their program because, you would learn how to cope with hard labor, AND you would be helping your country. Being a part of this group is a once-in-a-life-time experience, and you don't want to pass it up.

The pros of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you would get to see fascinating places you probably wouldn't see otherwise. Such as Greese, New Orleans,and even oceans like the Atlantic or the Pacific. And you could also make a lot of friends on the way.

The cons of being a part of this would be that you might not be able to see your family very often. You might miss the family holidays, like Christmas and Thanksgiving, but you can still talk to them over the phone and communicate with letters.

Along with the fun and games, there is always danger. The seas could get rough, and you could get hurt, but the professionals on the job will try to keep you as safe as possible, for as long as possible.

So, if you are an outgoing, traveling, helping hand, animal lover type of person, then THIS is the program for you. So join now, this once-in-a-life-time opportunity won't last forever!",3,6,0.848599910736084
5c27966,"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join because you could be helping the lives of the lives of thousands of innocent people whose homes where destroyed in the wars. One of the interesting things of joining the program is that you can see a amazing sights from all around the world.

It is an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Helping these people you can get the benefit of going to China and Europe and their famous landmarks. If you go to Italy there is a chance you could ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. When i was in Crete is saw an excavated castle. On your way to China you can marvel your eyes at the Panama Canal. If your not in the mood for sight seeing you can go downstairs with some of you co-workers and play some baseball,volleyball,fencing,boxing,reading,whittiling,and Table-tennis to help pass the time while on board.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me.

It opened up the world to me and was vey grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of peolple in other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me for along time. It lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. If you had any job or chore working on a farm then this job will be great for you.

When your on night watchman duty be careful when it rains. Because when I was on night watchman duty it was raining cats and dogs. I was climbing down a ladder when my foot slipped and I fell in my side. I nearly slid stright off the deck. But before i could fall i grabbed on to a piece of metal before i could fall off. I couldn't work for a few days because of a few cracked ribs. But if you do join just know that your co-workers are there to help you with injuries.

In conclusion, I think that you should join our Seagoing Cowboy program.

Not only will you be helping us by joining but you will also help innocent lives of people who were harmed in the war. ",4,6,0.8207014203071594

You may never have this kind of oppurtunity again, so why not take it. All you have to do is feed some cattle a couple times a day, clean some stalls, and if your the night watchman, all you do is check on the cattle once every hour then report back to the captain.

After you drop off the cattle or shipment at its desired location you can go look around and do some sight seeing. No matter where you are i bet you can see some amazing things, even if your not much of a sightseer i bet you'll end up seeing something that you've never seen before.

Then on your way back home on the ship, you and your crew mates can play games and sports where the cattle or shipment used to be to pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy may not seem very fun, but it can be if you make the most out of it.",2,6,0.7411688566207886
5c7a06d,"In the article""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke helped people in WW l l. When you help others they will help you back. It is nesessary to what it important to others. Some people thinks its funny to watch other contenets to bein war. I don't like to see our allies in war whille we stayed and watched.

When you help others they will help you back in what way they can. It could be anything like helping you with building somethin or perhaps makeing dinner and hangging out. All i kmow is it would be the right thing to do. You could be the one who wants to do them a favor or they do you a favor and you want to help them in a way.

Its important to do what is nesessary. People do what is nesessary for their familys or friends. Mabey even pets. If you don't you might be making a bad choose in what you will do in the future.

When Luke helped people he is doing the right thing. People from WW l l gave their lives to save the place of thins they loved. Even I would give my life for anyone and everyone I cared for. This time he wanted to help them with animals, food, and whatever eals they needed. He played an very important role for the people of Europe.

This shows my reason of Lukes point of view. You should help others when you have a chance and not just sit and watched. I would have volenteered myself to help others in need. He wanted to see the world and have fun al along to help others. This is my argument of the story. ",2,6,0.5919584035873413
5c80df3,"Have you ever thought of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Well you should Luke was once asked do you want to go to Europe on a cattle boat he could not waste the oppurtunity of a lifetime.

Some reasons you should join this is because you will have a lot of fun. Especially if you love animals maybe you are a farmer and you love animals just join the Seagoing Cowboys. Or maybe you just want to have a little adventure a Seagoing Cowboy would be a great idea. Some people may say it is to dangerous and bla bla bla. It does not matter what other people think what matters is your opinion if you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy go for it. Do not waste the oppurtuniy of your lifetime. If you want to go on an adventure Seagoing Cowboy is perfect because Luke once went and they visited China it took a long time but they still went and Luke said it was great.

Some details that Luck gave in the article were pretty amazing. You could actually imagine it in yor head. The way he described everything. So you should not waste an oppurtunity of a lifetime it is advetures,fun,you get to vist a lot of places. If you love animals you get to be with animals. It may take a long time to get to the destination the ship is going but you could take something along to do or play with the animals. You just have to feed them and clean them or else they are going to get all stinky and unhealthy and the ship will smell bad. Some other details that can support Lukes claim is that in the article it said that the cowboys play baseball and volleyball when the animals are unloaded they play in the empty holds where the animals were. They would also play Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. In the aricle Luke also said that Seagoing is more than an adventure.

To conclude, this is why you should take the oppurtunity of a lifetime and be a Seagoing Cowboy. If you like animals there is animals if you like adventures there is adventure. There is something there for every boy to enjoy and have a good time. While there you may want to open up your brain and think of the things you have done in life and think if this was one of the things you ever imagined doing.        ",2,6,0.8635552525520325

""No, there is so much more to see everywhere else in the world than what is to be seen here, in America."" I said

""Well, yes I do, but I'm not sure I am comfortable going over seas with a lot of smelly, messy animals."" Bobby argued.

""Bobby, can't you just get past that? You would be able to help people in need, and not to mention the animals, but you are just going to pass that up because you don't want to be living in the same ship as these animals?""

I was quite furious at this point. He was being very stubborn, and I do not like to deal with stubborn people.

When Luke arrived to New Orleans the day right after the Pacific war ended Stating in paragraph three.

In this story Luke is working at a store and his friend invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe after World War 2. He knew this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. So he went.

You could see how he was feeling just by the way the author put it. He was exicited and he was ready. When Luke found out that he was to take care of horses, young cows, and mules he knew he would be good at it because he worked at his aunts farm. He thought this would be a good time to help out with this disaster. Luke went overseas just to do someting helpful for the problems people had. All the stuff people had were gone because of the World War 2.

He had some rough times on way, like running into storms, big waves and other stuff that happen in the ocean, but hey it was worth it. But some thingss got severe, when he broke his ribs during a storm. He took nine trips on the cattle boat. And this was big for him because he was a small - town boy. He also knew he was helping out thousands of people. Over seas, Luke was very busy with the animals. He had to feed them 2 to 3 times a day. Thats a lot of work for young boy.

Just by reading this article you can tell how much work you will have but your doing it for people who can't do this stuff. So what, it may be hard, it may be boring, but those people need your help.

Another interesting thing you could do if you join them, is you could meet new people.

Since your on a ship for long periods of time, to keep you busy you could play games in empty holds. Some of the games you could play are baseball, volleyball, fencing, or boxing. When playing these games, you can find people who are intersted in the same hobbies you enjoy. The Seagoing Cowboy group is a great way to meet new people and make friends.

The Seagoing boys doesn't just help you make friends, travel the world, but it's much more. It can open up the world to you, so this is why it's so important to some of the people who join.

I, Luke Boberger, am a former Seagoing Cowboy and I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and have crossed the Pacific Ocean twice to help those affected by World War II. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a great adventure, but it was also more than that. It opened up the world to me.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys, you get to see, and sometimes visit, amazing and beautiful places. When myself and the crew first set sail from New Orleans to deliver 335 horses to Greece, I couldn't wait to get there. I saw the Acropolis in Greece, and it was beautiful! When delivering animals to these foreign lands, I also got the side benefit of seeing a lot of Europe and China. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, explore an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

By joining the Seagoing Cowboys, you get the important, but rewarding, job of caring for those in dire need. When I joined the Seagoing Cowboys, I had no idea the happiness you receive from helping those who need help. By delivering food supplies, animals, and even more, you make these people's lives a lot more easier. You are giving them food, animals to make into food, and animals to help with work. Helping these citizens really opened my eyes to the rest of the world.

The final thing I'm going to tell you about is having fun. When I was on the ship, and the animals and supplies had been delivered, we had fun on the ship. It wasn't the reason I had joined, but it is definitely a joyous side benefit. Us cowboys would play baseball and volleyball games where animals had been kept. We also held table-tennis tourneys, fenced, boxed, read, and whittled to pass the time. It's amazing what you can do when you're bored on a nearly-empty ship!

These are the reason why I believe that all able and willing men need to join the Seagoing Cowboys. You get to see wonderful lands. You also can have fun on the ships. Most importantly though, you get to help those in need. It's amazing that doing a job like this can make such an impact on people's lives. Join the Seagoing Cowboys!

I chose the claim that you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys because they helped a lot of thing in Europe when World War 2 was over. In the passage it says,"" World War 2 was over in Europe and many conturies were left to ruins."" Also the passage says,"" To help these countries recover their food supply, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA.""

The UNRRA wasnt only helping animals they were also helping people. My evidence to support that claim is,"" Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic ocean 16 times and the Pacific 2 to help people who were affected by World War II."" It was thoughtful that Luke did all of those things to save people that were affected by World War II.

Luke made nine trips which was more than any Seagoing Cowboy has ever done. Luke was brave and thoughtful for joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke saved many lives after World War II. He didnt save only human lives he saved animals lives too and i feel that was thoughtful.

In coinclusion, Luke was very thoughtful and nice to save people after the War went on. Luke said that being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than and adventure. The awarness he has stayed with him and now he is leading hus family to a host a number of international students and dexchange visitors for many years. Luke helped people by joing the UNRRA and that was kind and thought i hoped Luke had a fun time doing his job.                   ",3,6,0.8189136981964111

If you join you get to love the people you help and love the animals you help! You also get to have fun on the boat you are on traveling on, like play table tennis, vollyball, boxing, and more!

Luke Bomberger set the world record for going on nine trips. See, you can do that to if you join the Seagoing Cowboys. You can change peoples lifes just like Luke Bomberger did to the people he helped. Luke said that it opened the world to him because of the things he did to change the people's lives.

In-conclusion, always want to do what Luke Bomberger did, join the Seagoing Cowboys program, and help many of people and animals. That is why I would join the Seagoing Cowboys, to help as many people as I can and set a world record of 12 trips! Also to help children, and parents get through of what they loss in the war!

And he would be missing an opportunity in his life time. Lukes 2 part time jobs where working at a store and a bank.

It was 1945 world war 2 Luke and Don signed up to feed the animals. They has to fees 335 horses. They also had to feed cows, and mules that they had to feed.

It was August 1945 , The boys just recived their order reports to new Orlans.

Luke is now 18 year sold Luke said that they had a sight seeing of Europe and China. It took 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. And It took a month to get to China.

Luke surved as a night watch man. He had to feed the animals every hour. So that way they did not have to starve. And cry all night for food and water to eat and drink.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive. But he couldnt work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Luke also found time to have fun and he got to play volleyball, table tennis,boxing and fencing but this happend after they unloaded the animals then they got to have fun and enjoy their time.

Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and he crossed the PAcific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War 2.                                                 ",1,6,0.5413904786109924

The UNRRA started hiring ""Seagoing Cowboys"" at the end of World War II. These ""Cowboys"" helped haul animals across the ocean to help with their food supply. Once Luke Bomberger had hauled ""335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them."" It's an amazing experience that many people would love.

First of all, being on board across the ocean meant ways to pass time. ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animnals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games helped pass time.""

Secondly, you get to see amazing places all over the world. As I said at the beginning, Luke got to wittness the trips through Venice, Italy and a castle in Crete. ""I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

I will also tell you what we do in the program and some reasons you should join this program. In this program we will be helping alot of farm animals and taking care of them. The reason you should join is because alot of these animals need help and they shouldn't have to die because people don't want to take care of them.So if you like farm animals then you should join.

I will be explaining why you guys should join the Seagoing Cowboy program and what we will be doing to make a diffrence. So after I graduated high school and got two part-time jobs at a store and a bank then, one day

one of my friends came up and asked would I like to go to Europe with him I couldn't say no because it was once in a lifetime thing. Then in 1945 when World War ll was over and alot of countries were not normal. Then 44 nations joained together to help them all they help supplies them with food,animals,and more but thats not the point. The point is that there was alot of farm animals that needed to be taken care of. They shipped then overseas and that is when me and my friend signed up to help them because we know that those animals needed our help.

In the conclusion, I think all yall who love animals farm animals or not should join. These animals shouldn't have to die because people wanted to go to war. They help

us live by giving us milk and food so we should help them live. You all should sign up today and come join me and my friend we need all the help make a big diffrence in these animals lives.If you don't sigh up then remeber all the animals around you and what if they was just like these farm animals.

The Seagoing Cowboys are participants who are helping countries who went to war. We are helping them by giving them food supplies , animals , & much more. While we are on the cattle boat we have to do jobs. My job is to feed the animals three or two times a day , and pull bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. You could do that too. You would be able to be around the animals you love! When we arrive to the country that is in need of help ,we drop off the animals and the food supplies.

One reason to join this program is because you have so much fun! On my first trip I thought the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for me. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was really special. Also taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Another reason why you should join this program is because you get a chance to help people. The Seagoing Cowboys is about helping people with what they need. I went just after World War ll ended. A lot of small towns and cities were ruined from the war and needed help on getting their farming equipment. We were on a cattle-boat that had about 335 horses plus oats and hay to feed them. We had a lot more animals on our ship.

Some of the bad things about joining this program is the hard work and danger. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day at least. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship and stalls had to be cleaned. But the worst part about joining this program is the danger. When I joined this program I cracked a couple of ribs. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, when I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. I was happy to be alive, but I could not work for a couple of days.

The job of a Seagoing Cowboy is very adventures. If you are a adventures guy this is perfect you get to see many great places in the world, and who doesn't want to see new places, it is a blast. You can see many amazing places like I did say for example the Panama Canals they were really cool. You get to experience many great things like going to Venice, Italy, ""A city with streets of water."" You get to visit many more great places like these but sometimes it does take some time to get there but that is just part of the fun.

This job is also very awesome because you can have a lot of fun while doing this job. There are a lot of fun things to do when you are a Seagoing Cowboy for example after you are done with the main job which would be delivering the stuff you can play many different games and puzzles onboard the ship. They are really really fun for example you get to play baseball, volleyball, and even have table-tennis tournaments you could all that in the place were you held the animals, I had a lot of fun and I still do I love this job.

62a61d6,"I am about to tell you, from Luke's point of view, why participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great opportunity and why you shouldn't pass it up I'f you do get invited to go.

The first reason is becuase you could go on so many journeys,and trips that you've never even thought of in your head before. Like it says in the article Luke couldn't say no to an opportunity that huge. Anyway,like I was saying there's so many unique and fun places that you could go. Luke went to Europe and China,and Acropolis in Greece, it's an amazing journey. Sometimes if the journey that you are taking is a very long one,like in the passage You could do a lot of things. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast and a month to get to China. In addition, they would play baseball,volleyball games,Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading and whittling.

The second reason is becuase if you've never taken a trip anywhere out of the U.S then this is an amazing chance for you to get out there and explore different places of the world. Why would you wanna pass up an amazing chance like that? Being in this program could take you anywhere in the world from places ranging to Venezuela all the way to Athens,Greece and those are beautiful places in the world. Wouldn't you like to go see them? I'f you've already been to the places that the program would take you,then,hey, what's the harm in seeing those places again? You never know they could've built new homes,stores,hotels,and everything awesome like that. Okay,yes,it says in the passage that One rainy night,after making his hourly report to the captain,Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside and cracked his ribs. Everyone gets physically in their lifetime.

The third reason, this reason is for parents. Wouldn't you love for your child to go and explore the different places of the world? They would be so excited if they were to get a chance like that to go to all different places of the whole world. I mean of course they would probably hesitate at first because they would be so far from home. They could go to Fiji,Thailand and just work work with animals and play games,do every fun thing that a kid is supposed to do while their still young. In the article,Paragraph 9 Luke says ''I'm grateful for the opportunity'' It made me more aware of our people and countries and their needs''.

Fourth Reason is you get to help people in other countries who are homeless,doesn't have any food,tired,sleepless nights and going through everything. Your child could become a doctor from benefting from this trip and helping people. Their are countries and people in need,and this is a great chance to help people out and benefit from what people are going through. In the passage it says he even went to

Venice,Italy,streets with water''. He visited a castle in Crete and loved the viewing at the Panama Canal on his way to China. Like I said in the other paragraphs their are so many places for your kids to go and have fun in this world. Just know it's an amazing opportunity.

Concluding this essay. What I'm trying to point out is that this is an opportunity of a lifetime. You could explore places and countries around this world you didn't know existed. Kids it's a great opportuntity. Don't pass it up. There's so much in this wrold that you would accomplish just being out in the world.

There are times when you have to be serious and help or do the best of your abilities, but there are times when you can play games. The coyboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. In addition, the games also helped pass time in our long journies.

The reason I like being Seagoing Cowboy is all the different things you get to see and learn about on the way. Another reason I like to be a Seagoing Cowboy is the people I met, and the people I helped change their life in a good way. Plus you get to do the things you normally might do at home.

This is just one reason for joining the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" and there are a lot more reasons why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"", and we are going to be talking about some others. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"", as some of you may wonder, was in 1945, when World War II ended in Europe. When Luke graduated high school, he worked two part-time jobs, one in a grocery store and one in a bank, when his friend, Don Reist invited him to go to Europe to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". That is where his journey began.

Luke join the program, the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program, to take care of animals that were shipped over seas. I know this, because in the story the author states, ""Luke signed up to be a 'Seagoing Cowboy' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" One reason you could join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" is, to see other beautiful artifacts of the world. I know this, because the author states, ""Luke observed the marvelous wonder of the excavated castle in Crete and the, all amazing, Panama Canal.""

These are only two reasons why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

Another reason why you could join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" is, if you like to get away from home and visit a nice little vacation. I know this, because the author states, ""Luke toke a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with water as streets."" One other reason is, if you like to go over seas. This is a reason, because the author states, ""It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean."" Both of these reasons are, like always, just some few, of many, reasons why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

One of two other reasons, that you should join the program, is, if you love to take care of animals then this is the right job for you. I know this, because the author states, ""The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day."" The second reason you should join the program is, if you just like to be on a boat. I know this, because the author states, ""Luke got his paper and boarded the 'SS Charles W. Wooster.""' These are the final two reasons why you should join the program.

What we talked about in this essay was, that there are many reasons why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. Somwe of the reasons are, that if you love to take care of animals.

This program helps you learn some life skills, get new experiences, and still have some fun. Most of the time you will be with animals, traveling, seeing new places and dicovering new things. This program alows you to get closer to animals and learn about them.

One benifit from being in this program is you get to travel to so many places. For example on my way to China I got to tour in a castle in Crete, and marvel at the Panama Canal. You might think you will not learn on these trips, but there are many leason's and other things you will learn.

When your traveling you get to learn to be aware of other people and their needs from different countrys, you will learn some of their ways with animals.

One thing I think is the best part about being in this participating in this program is, you get to help animals and take care of them. At least three times a day you had to feed, water them, and every once and a while all of the stalls have to be cleaned. Most people think helping animals is not going to be any fun, but there are some fun things you get to do. When the animals are unloaded you get tp play baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass the time.

You still might say this is not going to be a good experence but, there are a lot of animals you get to work with. Some of the animals are horses, young cows, mules and more. When you are with the animals you get to help them and work with them. If you are not the type of person who likes animals this is not for you.

When all of the cattle are in other countries, the places where they were stored become opened up and you're allowed to play games. Some coyboys enjoy playing baseball and volleyball games, while others like having Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. All of these games allow a cowboy to spend the rest of the way back having fun and if a cowboy doesn't want to play games, he can stay in his room and enjoy some quiet.

I think that people should join this because of internatinal travel to help people across the globe. Also if you are a Farmer this job would be perfect because you would know exactly what to do with the animals that are being taken to another country to help the people that had lost a lot to the World War 2. This program could teach you what to do if you would want to be a Farmer.

The cattle-boat trip is an unbelieavable opportunity for a small town boy.

This job can be dangeris because a crew member almost when over board injering his ribs. This job can also be fun because you get to play games in the livestock stalls and tour different cityies.

In councludion this program can be a mix of fun and dangeris to people.

""It made me aware of people and other countries needs"" What do you think life as a Seagoing Cowboy was like?   ",2,6,0.8710649609565735
65eb0c4,"I am a seagoing cowboy named Luke. I've been on nine trips overseas because of my friends. They brought me there. I will be your friend for you to go there. It was such a fun time going overseas with a bunch of life stock and the adventures I was in were amazing. You sould go and sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The first reason you should join is because of the sights. The sights I got to see when I was traveling were terrific! I wouldn't wish to do anything different than go and look at those sights again. I actually got to see Europe and China. That is awesome for some small town boy. I was very grateful for that.

It sounds like all we do is see sights and deliver cattle but we play games too! We play games like you would but in empty rooms on the boat. We have table-tennis tournaments. We also had fun on board by fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and other games.

I don't want you to get the wrong thaughts but I also don't want you to think its all fun and games. Yes we have fun and play games but we do this to help people. We don't just go sailing across the seas with some cattle, we deliver it. It is hard work but it also is realy fun. We get to feed the cattle and take care of them for the two to four weeks of traveling. We bring up hay bails and take turned doing the night shift. That's when I got injured. I almost fell of the ship but I got saved by a peice of metal. I had a few broken ribs but I've healed up quite nicely.

Although we do a lot of work on board we also do have a great time together of board too. I mentioned the sights. That's my favorite thing to do off board. It's also great to see the different cultures and how we can help them and fix their food problems. It's cool to think about what I do. I take food to people who need it and save lives just my taking care of a couple cows. It makes me feel great that I can actually do something that important with such little supplies.

With the good and the bad I still love doing this. The Seagoing Cowboys program is amazing and I hope you join it. The things we do and the things we see are amazing and it's a once in a life time opportunity I, again, really hope you take it and use it to make your life better. Please join the Seagoing Cowboys program. ",4,6,0.8610663414001465

Being a Seagoing Cowboy has times where you needed to be serious and take your work seriously, but it also has times where you could have a lot of fun. There were many things that you can do when you become a Seagoing Cowboy. You could help take care of animals, serve as a night watchman, etc. There were many things you could have done if you dont like one of the jobs, there is so many new things to experience!

After working, the guys and I would play baseball and volleyball games. A good way to just relaxand take it easy after working hard. Others even sometimes had table-tenis tournaments, fencing, reading, games, whittling, and even boxing! The activities were fun and helped pass time. The games were just a way to let loose for a while. Anyone is bound to have fun!

I also learned a few things in my time of being a Seagoing Cowboy. For instance, being a Seagoing Cowboy helped me become more aware of the people in other countries and their needs. Many people out there are struggling to do things for themselves, and their country. So help out! Whenever you get an opertunity to help someone you should take it. It's a great way to help out. Think about what it could do for you, and other people! Don't let this amazing opertunity slip through your fingers. Become a Seagoing Cowboy today! I promise, you won't regret it.",3,6,0.8084225654602051

They left again to but this time their going to Greece. When they got to Greece Luke turned 18years old. Before he was discharged in 1947 Luke made 9 trips. It took about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and 1 month to get to China.

Luke had a job if he got bored it was to feed the animals 2 or 3 times a day. one rainy night after making his hourly report to the captain he slid down a slippery ladder and broke his ribs so he couldn't work. but after that he retired and opened the letters from the people that sent him letters",1,6,0.48601675033569336

''It is the most adventrous, exciting job you can possibly get, and the Seagoing Cowboys are looking for volunteers!'' I yelled, straining to get their attention.

I thought to myself for a moment, and started to get attention again. I thought about how I was presenting myself, and what I would want to hear about this program if I were one of these townsfolk. I thought of an idea as I started to yell

'' Would you like to hear some of the adventures I had so you may be interested?'' I asked.

They all cried out,'' Yes please!''

'' I was 18 before arriving in Greece,but I was heading to Greece with 335 horses, and loads of hay and oats to feed the horses with.'' I began to tell the townsfolk, but then I remembered why I was here.

''I wouldn't want to tell you the details though, or else you would miss the opportunity of you experiencing it yourselves.'' I exclaimed to the people of the town.

Everyone started asking if I would tell them what had happened on my journey.

I told them,'' The only way is to find out yourselves is you have to sign up and be at the docks in 3 weeks.'' I finished.

I hoped off the wooden box I was standing on, and I asked,'' Do you still want me to tell you two or three stories, and then you sign up?'' I questioned, again.

They all cried out,'' Yes!''

I told them about giving out horses in Greece, and the time I toured other incredible sites like an excavated caslte in Crete.

After I told two or three stories of my marvoulus trip, every single person listening to me shouted at the same time,'' Where are the sign up sheets?'' or '' Where do I sign up at?''

We sould have all the same stuff and thing as everyone else cause it ulike them to have food,water,etc,and more but we do so if they are differnet we are all the same and they sould be able to get things to it not fair that they all sould be happy as we are cause we are all human together we help each other like Luke and Don did to help that were in war and lost all there homes and their food and water.

So i think that we sould come together and help give food and other thing to the poor so they won't feel left out on all thing that are going on in America. they probly think that we are just having fun and they suffer though all kinds of thing like no real cholthes or shoes nothing and we have it all they probly are reallt skinny they can't wear anything but old cloth.

we sould put up a fundraiser and use the money to get them some new thing and work together and rebulid up their houses again os they will be safe and warm inside a home . sometime i feel like we are just need a break from all this technology and go back to books and learn things that are in our brains then when you learn how to care for other then you can go back to the way you are and e happy as will they if you are much about them.

Don and I think that they sould join a help suvice and help people who had war and lost everything they had to earn so we came and traveled every plac you can think of that had war and gave them food,water,and a home to stay at.

Even if you don't see those places, you defindely get to see Greece! ""' Seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special.""' I said. '""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.""' I supported. I also got to see the Panama Canal on my way to China.

You also get to care and help animals. You get to feed the animals, water them, and the stalls have to be cleaned. Even if this is not your favorite thing to do, you are still helping animals! Just like you need care, animals also need care, so it is a very kind thing to do.

You also get to play games, and have lots of fun! The games I played were baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. I added in my article that, ""games also help pass time."" That is very true! I loved playing games on board!

In conclusion, I got to learn lots of things about people who need help, and also animals. I stated in my article, ""' It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""'

The first reason I thing you should join is we get to see all kinds of things on the boat. Like one time I got to see an excavated castle in Crete and I also marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. The reason I joined is because it is a one in a life time thing. You don't get to see castles every day or the Panama Canal.

When we drop off some of the animals we use some of there stales to play games in and we play like vollyball, and baseball, and table tennis tournaments. We also do boxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and it is a fun time on the boat.

One time when I was on one of my nine trips more then anyone I was a watchman and I was checking all the crates like I normaly do , but that night it was raining so I reported the news with the captian. Everything was good and I was coming down the ladder and I slipped down my back side and my heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped my slide and that strip of metled saved me from falling over board.

His friend convenced him to go and help the peolpe across seas that are injured from World War ll. He decided to go and help. When he was on his first trip to go to help he turned 18 and was supposte to go into the army but they said to keep helping, and that would be his serivce time.

Luke has a good idea to help spread the word. He should try to convince people to go and help people that got hurt in World War ll. He should start by telling a lot of people about the Seagoing Cowboys program. lso, he should tell people what they do. Next, he should make posters to show people that the Seagoing Cowboys extict. Then, he should say where they going and how they are seeing all of the different historial places along the way. Finally, he should tell the people what the program offers and how they visit many unique places.

Some reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboy programs are, that you get to take care of animals when you are going across the ocean. Also, you get to help people that need to things that you are bring to them. A lot of things were lost in World War ll. So, you can help give back from the people that we took stuff away from. Also, you see a lot of different cultures. You would get to see the way that people live. Then, when you are over there you can see what the country's culture is. Like, when you are in China you can see all of the stuff that they make over there. You might even see some of the places that were attacked. When you go different place, you get to see different things that you may of never seen before. When you are over seas you can see many interseting things. That is one reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Another reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that once you drop off all of the animals and help the people you have one or two months with open animal cages. On the way back you can play games like, you can wrestle, have table-tennis tournaments, you can fence, and you can box. There are many other game that you could play.

Seagoing Cowboys program.

They also got to ride the gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Our group also got to see an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on their way to China.

There isn't only helping people and seeing sites, you actually get to travel the high seas. However, this might be the hardest part. The groups were always busy and it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. The part that had to be the most challenging for some members were caring for the animals during the crossings.

There are also fun times on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Usually we play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals are housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure for some people. For most of our groups, it opened up the world to them. They stated that they were ""grateful for the opporunity, and that it made them more aware of people of ther countries and their needs.""

In conclusion, that is why you should join our Seagoing Cowboys program. Thank you for listening, and we hope to see you in the future!",4,6,0.745560884475708

Our ship is really cool too! We're almost like pirates in a ship on the sea. We get to go to so many new places as well. I've been to Greece, New Orleans, the Panama Canal, China, and different parts of Europe. You always hav time to have fun too when your on board or off board. We play vollleyball, baseball, and table tennis. We also fence, box, read, whittle, and play games just to pass the time. This is an opportunity of a life time!

Trust me you dont want to miss this! I love this place and have made many friends on it. You will have so much fun too! I hope i see you here one day! I hope you will like it too.                                      ",2,6,0.7377189993858337
6969618,"Just because the Seagoing Cowboys program seems old, it is still a good thing to join. The Seagoing Cowboys fit many people's needs. Our number one reason for this program is to do good deeds for other people in other countries. We help these people after wars, and when their towns are destroyed. Although I only helped take care of the animals that were boarded on the ship being sent over, I still benefitted to the people on the ship by doing work for them. It kept me busy. I watched the animals and and checked on them, and I also reported on how they were doing. I also had night shifts to check on the animals each hour. One night, however, I slipped on a ladder, and couldn't work for a few days because of racked ribs. Thankfully, I fell on a piece of metal, and it caught me from falling into the ocean. I am lucky to be alive!

We don't work the whole time in the program, however. You would like what we get to do when we aren't working. We exlore and visit new, interesting places. We go to several different countries, and get to see how the people's culture, life style, and needs are different than ours. I had gotten a tour of a castle in Crete, visited China, Europe, and the Acropolis in Greece! Not only did we visit places, but we also had some freetime once in a while on board. We had baseball games, volleyball games, tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program, it is beneficial to 18 year old men, or men older than 18. Why? It is because when you are drafted to the military services at age 18, the military will count this program as your serving. I had turned 18 while I was on board and before we had even arrived to Greece, and I knew I couldn't be in the program and military at once. Lucky for me, the military coutned it as my service. Lastly, if you have ever wanted to meet other nations, you should join this program. Up to 44 nations join together to comeplete the tasks of the Seagoing Cowboys. Overall, I think that the Seagoing Cowboys are a very helpful, beneficial group of good people.",4,6,0.8588916659355164

I know this because in the text it states,""He knew it was an oppertunity of a lifetime.""

It allowed him to experience ad ventures and visit many unique places because when he heard about the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" had to help Europe get food and supplies ever since World War 11. In the text it state's,""It was 1945,World War ll was over in Europe, and many contries were left in the ruins.""The text also state's,""To help these contries recover their food suplies, animals, and more, 44 naitions joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaitin Administraition).""The text also state's,""Luke signed up.""He signed up because he wanted to help and make a different.

Luke can convince you all to join the Seagoing Cowboys by telling you all the oppertunities and chances you will get ,and I know you will have a wiled adventure. I know this because in the text it state's,""The cattle-trip were an unbelievable ppertunity for a small town boy"",he says. The text also state,""Besides helping people, I had side benefit seeing Europe and China.""

Thats how I know you all would like to join the ""Seagoing Cowboy's""program.

I know that you would all like adventures and learning about all the unique stuff they do on a boat for 2 weeks or longer to get across the Atlantic to China, to behonest I would probably get sea sick after a while. In the text it states,""It took two weeks to cross the the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern of the United States and a month to get to China.""The text also states,""They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.""

It was very difficult sometimes to be on a boat for about a month because you have to keep everything clean and lift hay and oats on the boats and do all of your jobs all of the time. I know this because in the text it states,""Bales of hay bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. I also know it was probaly a little difficult because the text also states,""Stalls had to be cleaned.""I could tell that was very hard by the sound of it and how I can picture it happening.

69dfcda,"""Seagoing Cowboys"" take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. When one becomes a Seagoing Cowboy, one's life is changed forever. There are three main reasons for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, and they are the beautiful places one might visit, the good cause that one is helping, and the fun one can have while doing the job. In this argument, I will elaborate on each of these reasons. First, I will expand on what is meant by beautiful places.

The first reason that I think one should become a Seagoing Cowboy is all of the beatiful places you might visit. When one is a Seagoing Cowboy, and one travels through Europe to help people, there are plenty of opportunity to visit beautiful places, such as Venice, Italy, where one can take a gondola ride through the streets of water, or the Acropolis, in Greece. One also occasionally finds beautiful places on one's way to another place, such as the Panama Canal, if one is going to China. That is the first reason for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Now, I shall elaborate on the second reason.

The second reason for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that one will be helping a good cause. War is a horrible thing, and sometimes, animals cannot be kept. Animals are very important beings, and we should try to protect them to our greatest extent. So going on trips just to help animals, which happens to be what Seagoing Cowboys do, is a very worthy cause. If one truly cares for animals, and one has the opportunity to help both animals and people, then why shouldn't one do so? There is no reason at all. Now, I shall elaborate on the third, and final reason for which I believe one should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

The third, and final reason, for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, is the fun that one will have while doing the job. When one is a Seagoing Cowboy, one often has spare time during the job, and there are plenty of opportunities to meet new people, and to have fun with them, playing games such as volleyball, and baseball. One might even find a lifelong friend, working as a Seagoing Cowboy. If someone does not have very many friends, they would have a chance of finding one as a Seagoing Cowboy. That is the third and final reason for which I think one should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Now, I shall finish this argument.

Seagoing Cowboys take care of cattle that has been sent overseas. There are several reasons for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, and they are the beautiful places one might visit, the worthy cause one is serving, and the fun one might have. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a good idea for all of us. Now why would anyone think otherwise?",4,6,0.7709728479385376

I say this, because being in the Seagoing Cowboys program includes lots of different things such as; caring for animals. Shown in paragraph 2 as it said,"" UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys, to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Being a part of the Seagoing prevented Luke from having to be drafted by the military. It clearly states in paragraph 4 by Luke ,""When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to keep doing that for my service.""

Even through times when Luke was hurt, there was still other things that he could do like play games. As shown in paragraph 7. ""One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside."" But Luke found fun on board in paragraph 8.

This is why, I think being a participant for the Seagoing Cowboys is a very imortant oppourtunity that everyone should be able to do.",2,6,0.8246718645095825
6a18fc8,"""The Seagoing Cowboys program is an adventure,"" stated Luke. We go all over the place, for example we have been to China and Greece. The Seagoing Cowboys program made me more aware of people's needs in other countries. When we had nothing to do we would waste time by playing games in empty holds where animals had been housed.

When I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program we helped baby cows, mules, and horses that were shipped overseas. We arrived August 14 when the Pacific war ended. Don and I headed for Greece with horses and hay and oats to feed them.

You should be apart of the program because it is fun to go on adventures and take care of the animals. Even if you don't like animals you get to have freetime and play games and visit places like China. When you unload the animals you can play tennis, boxing, reading, and whittiling. The program opened up the world for me.

When I took care of the animals they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Also you had to pull up bales of hay and bags of oats. Next then you had to clean the stalls out. When I worked at a farm for my aunt Katie, it prepared me for the Seagoing Cowboys program. I was greatful for the opportuniy to help the program.

You should join the program because you help people by bring the animals and you have fun at the same time. I want to go back and join the program because it was the best thing ever and it opened up the world to me by exploring and seeing other countries. When I saw the family's in need my family hosted a number of exchanged students for many years.                ",2,6,0.8043846487998962
6a30d2a,"Have you ever thought about changing your life, going to China and Europe, or wnating to join a program and find out how it works? I will describe details why I wnat you to be in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will include how it may change your life and the amazing sights I've seen, to try and persude you to join us in the program.

Firstly, I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because of how it will change your life. Before the program I was just a kid, graduated from high school, and working two part-time jobs. I worked at a grocery store and a bank when my friend, Don Reist stopped by to invite me to go to Europe in a cattle boat. I could not say no and I accepted the offer. That decision changed my life a lot.

In addition, I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program beause of all of the amazing sights you will see. Besides helping people, I got to see parts of Europe and China. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece, which was very special. I also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, where the streets are water. I also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete and I marveld at the Panama canal on my way to China.

Lastly, I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program beacuse of how it works and how it helps people. You were probably thinking ""How does this program work?"" I have an answer for that question. When I was young and I got the opportunity to go to Europe with Don, I signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is where you take care of horses, young cows, and mules that have been shipped over sea. When World

War II ended in Europe, many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more, forty-four countries came together and formed the UNRRA ( the United Nation Relief and Rehabilitaion Adminitration). The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for many reasons. You will help ruined countries, see amazing sights, and go on an adventure of your own across the sea. This program will change your life and hopefully you will understand now why this is such a good and helpful program. I hope you will consider going into this program, and remember that if you do you will be helping thousands and thousands of people in different countries. ",4,6,0.8470722436904907

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it's an opportunity of a lifetime. Also you can see wonderful things and also tour wonderful places, like Europe and China just like I did. When I joined the program in 1945 World War ll was over and the whole place was ruined (which wasn't very beautiful in my opinion). That is my introduction.

Luke said, ""I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime."" You can join this program, because it is just full of interesting sites, and places that you could go see and tour just like I did. ""The places that I toured was Europe and China"" ,says Luke. When Luke went to Europe which was 1945 World War ll was over and the place was left in ruins. You can also find super interesting and people that have fulfilling minds about all the places in Europe.

To support my claim Luke an some other cowboys had an amazing time on board (The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed) says Luke. He had more fun playing games then he did helping the animals. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United Statesand a month to get to China. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Those are my sentences to support Luke's claim.

In conclusion after reading these paragraphs you think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you can see all the things that maybe you have never saw before.

They would most likely like it a lot.

Luke Bomberger certainly did.

""Seagoing Cowboys"" is a program where young adults take a boat to Europe.

On the way there, they raise horses, cows, and mules.

When they get there, the cattle are taken to countries who need them.

I wish I was old enough to do that.

The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" help people in need.

There are millions of people out there who need a horse to eat, or a cow to get milk.

They might need a mule to help carry baskets of food or buckets of water that are too heavy for a single person to lift.

If a person were to join, they could see many unique and interesting places.

They would be very lucky.

A lot of people in the U.S. don't even have enough money to visit sites within our country.

Luke got to visit the Acropolis in Greece, take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, tour a castle in Crete, and even see the Panama canal!

It would also be an incredible experience.

How many people get to raise cattle and sail the Atlantic Ocean at the same time?

You may say that there would be no time for fun, but on the way back they do fun games in the space where the animals were housed.

Some of the games they play include sports, so you would also get exercise.

Some of the games they play are: baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Some might say it is very dangerous at sea.

All you have to do is be extremely careful and you won't get hurt.

If you do, then the other ship members will take extra good care of you.

""What if you go to a place with nothing interesting?"" you may ask.

Make it interesting.

Play in a field, run around for a bit, just chat.

It is very hard to become a Seagoing Cowboy. They have to take care of a lot of different jobs. They have to travel all around the world.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowbot is very fun. You make lots of new friends when you go to the trainy camps and things like that. I think that traning with all your friends is very fun to do.

6bd8e65,"Seagoing Cowboys aren't like pirates, or like land cowboys that rob people and do aweful things. They help out people when they are recovering from the terrible things that hitler and World War II brought them. When you sign, up you don't have to risk doing army time and going to fight becasue when you are a seagoing cowboy, it counts for your service time. Also, you get to see the world and how other people are living and how cultural our world is. In this essay I will tell you reason why is I know I did the right thing by sighning up to be a seagoing cowboy, and why you should sign up too!

The most important thing that I was able to do was to help out my community and beyond. When people were suffering from traumatic losses and hunger I was able to help heard and bring animals to the Jews, Germans, and Aisans that were all suffering from the outcome of the war. They were in poverty and were in need of people to safely get livestock to them so they could eat and be whole again. I think that by sighing up you get that sense of heroism and you know that you did a good deed. I think that by also sighning up it really helps life or death problems.

When I sighned up I knew that I would have to go fight for my country and maybe even die in battle. So, I turned 18 during my first trip and I knew I would have to stop what I was doing and to go serve in the army. But, when I went to go speak with the army, they said that helping to bring food to families wounded in the war counted as War time. I overjoyeced becasue I loved to do what I was doing and I didn't want to have to end that. Also because I didn't have to risk dying! Phew, thankgoodness! So thats why you should also sighn up so you don't have to go out and get shot! I also realized how big of an oppertunity it was and how much of the world I was going to be able to see.

The cattle-boat trips where an unbelievable oppertunity for a small-town boy like me! I had the benifit of sight seeing Europe and China. I saw the acropolis in Greece, and took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, with streets of water! Water people, I mean who would pass that oppertunity up? I toured an excavated castle in Crete, and awed at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Grece was very speacial, and China was amazing! When you take the chance of going out and doing things in the world you get see magnificent things. Even when your traveling between countries, you get to experiance marine life and biology!

See? That's the thrill of it all, that you get to be a real hero, not die, and see the world through your own two eyes! Now people might say that you don't get to see everything and you need to ""die for your country."" Don't listen to them, they are just being cynical. You make the decisions and you don't need one bad review to change how you feel about doing something! People might just judge you, but guess what they are just jealious that you get to see the world and be a true hero. That is why you should sign up to be a sea-cowboy. You never know where tomorrow will take you! I'm going to try to immitate Uncle Sam now, We need YOU to be a seagoing cowboy!",5,6,0.8202495574951172
6bf2b8d,"Do you think the seagoing cowboys is a good job? Well I do and here are some reasons why. You can spend lots of time with diffrent animals you can also spend alot of time out on the clear sunny ocean, and most of important of all you are helping people. When you are out on the ocean you can have alot of fun and join very easily. To think of it I joined just from my freind inviting me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

Spending alot of time with different animals on a ship is amazing. You get to feed, take care, and have alot of fun with them. Taking care of those young cows and mules can be alot of fun they can sometimes be funny and they can comfort you. Imagine if there was a really bad storm you will always have to cows and mules to keep you company. Would'nt you love being around lots of anmals?

When you get taken over seas to help people it feels good to know you are helping people in need. What if you were those people who needed help to get your countrie recovered from a bombing? You would want somebody or someone to help you recover. This is another reason why you should come and join the seagoing cowboys you can be someone who helps people in need of your assistance. This is another reason why you should join us.

Think of being on a cruse except with animals that is what it is like to be over the seas with the seagoing cowboys you can see the sunny clear ocean and there is plenty of fish. You will have a beutiful veiw of the nice pretty clear ocean. If your lucky enough you can even see the sight of diffrent fish. You can even get the chance to catch them if you wish. There is lots of diffrent things you can do over seas and we also get to help different countries.

In conclusion, you should join seagoing cowboys because you can have alot of fun if you enjoy being over sea with alot of animals see different fish help countries and be the best person you can be. Other things you can do are fencing,boxing,reading,vollyball, and baseball so if you enjoy these activities then you should consider joining the seagoing cowboys. When you are doing those activities it can pass the time if you are missing your family. These are reasons I think you should join the seagoing cowboys.           ",4,6,0.85887610912323

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you would have alot of fun and traveling. When you go to places you have never visited before its alot of fun like going to Europe, China, and Greece. You get to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean there you will get to see whales and dolphines swimming in the ocean.

You will have some bumps and bruises along the way but I bet you can fight through it like Luke and Don did. I also bet you will have as much fun as them too and get to know what more places feel like.",2,6,0.8526251912117004
6c4d482,"Theres lots of reasons why you should join the program but i'm going to give you the best reasons. As you can see from the artical/passage you can tell that Luke was helping animalsover seas from WWII. The text states, ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of: The horses, young cows and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.""

That was just the first reason and if you don't understand it i was trying to say you could help ship and save many animals lives. Now the next reason that might change your mind and help you began to slowly realise that you should join is going to different places. In the artical is states that Luke actually went to greece when he turned the age of 18. Which he even had free time on his hand and had fun doing his job

There is also fun on the ship when the animals get off and you have a little bit of time to play around. The author states, ""Luke also found time to have fun on board (When the animals got off the ship of course) the cowboys played baseball and volleyball and such.""

Now this job is not as easy as it seems and it can be dangerous, as you can clearly see that the text states, ""Luke was on night watch and slide on something, luckily he did not fall in to the atlantic but he still could not work do to the broken ribs."" As you can see its not that easy and can be dangerous if you're not careful and check your surroundings.

But by the end its all worth is, im sure luke felt good about himself once the job was finished and done. Touring around different citys, helping feed animals. Its amazing and something new and those are just some of the reasons why you should join the program and if you do good luck and have fun seeing different parts of the world",3,6,0.8268292546272278

But before i tell you what i really want to talk about im going to tell you a little about myself. Before i was a Seagoing Cowboy, traveling across oceans! and stuff like that, i was a normal teenager. I was working two part-time jobs,i was working in a grocery store and a bank. When i graduted from highschool, my friend Don Reist invited me on a cattle boat to Europe, i couldnt say no because i knew it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Lets stick to the topic now, being a Seagoing Cowboys is like being a super hero for instance, when you travel on a boat with animals your taking them to safer places. But you weren't just helping animals your also helping people as well. Your also traveling to diffrent places in Europe examples are like Greece,Panama,China and your also traveling across the biggest oceans in the world. But whats most important is that your helping people and making the world a better place. So come on join the Seagoing Cowboys Program it might be one of the best decisions you made yet.

Luke found time time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Cowboys got to play baseball,volleyball games, They also did Table tennis turnoments, writing, fencing,boxing,reading and whittling. It was more than an adventure for Luke too It opened up the world for him. ''It made me aware of people and other contries and their needs.''Luke said. That awarness stayed with him too. It took about two weeks to get there but it will be a very fun trip to go to snd relax,play games and do many fun things like visiting places you have never been to before like,, Anceint Greece, the tempels there and many more fantatic places that you would enjoy plus there is things to do before you get there. You have read about Seagoing Cowboys this was mainley about Luke and what he did it would be a very fun exoeriment too. He does many things before he gets to get across the Atlantic Ocean but it was worth it it would be fun for family and friends The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says. What helps you though before you go you can help yourself by gelping out around a farm becuase there are many animals on board you can prepare yourself for hard work with the animals. You watch the animals clean the animals, and feed the animals too. But you do have to watch out becuase when it gets dark and you cant see when the waves pick up it will push you around and so Luke broke one of his rib cages becuase he was being pushed around so he couldn' work and help out at all.",2,6,0.8666564226150513

Here are some reasons why you should come. First you should come beacause it might be the only time you will get to go to help other people from World War ll, so that would be a great opportunity to come.

Another reason is you would get to see out side of you country,and you would get to see other countrys. Also you would see what culture and gods they worship. You might even learn new things like how to grow carrots, or watermelon.

One more reason is you can even have fun on board. Like when you are coming back the animals would be unloaded and you would get to pet them and maby some animals like fetch. You could even play volleyball, or baseball in the empty hold wear animals had been. They also had tournements like baseball,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also help pass time.

I have shiped a lot of horses, young cows, and mules over the Alantic and sometimes the Pacific. We ship the animals over the sea to help a lot of people. You should join the UNRRA to help other people out, to change their lives.

We think all cowboys should join the UNRRA so we could make people have a better life then be poor. When you help people out you feel extrodinary. Some people say once you help some out you make you day.

I have been to across the Atlantic ocean 16 times and i have been across Pacific once. I still want to go but I have cracked ribs from an accident but it is worth helping others. I feel so great on helping other.

It is a one in a lifetime expireience it takes a month to get to China. It might take a while but it is like you never left because you still feed the cows and horses. The plus to this is you to explore preety places in China and Europe. You get to expirence something you probably have never expirenced before.

These are some reasons why to be a Seagoing Cowboy. I belive that you have a great time. Dont mis this chance because if you do you wont expirence any thing that i did.

When you go and help people like Luke did just think about those people and how they felt about you helping them with getting food and water. After your done helping someone in need like Luke did it kinda makes you feel happy that you did that for that person. Plus if you were to go on a cattle boat its not all just work you can also have a little fun playing tennis, boxing, fencing, Table tennis,and whittling and reading.

So lukes friend told him all about it and he told him if he would go to europe of corse luke coudn't say no so luke and don signed up for the seagoing cowboys so they could help europe with all the stuff they needed.In Agust 1945,they received their orders from new orleans.

First off, you will find that there is always something to do on board the ship, I found that there are many things to do so you can pass time. I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed on return trips after the animals were unloaded. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games were some of the activities that we did.

Also, when you are off the ship and you need something to do, you can explore the surrounding area. On my trips, I toured an excavated castle, saw the Acopolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are many things to see and do anywhere you are.

Lasty, you always know that the things that you do help many people in many ways. I always loved seeing the smiling faces of the people that I gave my time and energy into helping them. The people that we helped were survivors of World War II. Their belongings were destroyed, and most of their countries were left in ruins. We gave them food supplies, animals, and more.

So, do you want to be a seagoing cowboy now? If you do, thats great! The experience lets you remember that what you did changed peoples lives forever. If I had the chance to become a seagoing cowboy again, I would take it. This made me more aware of what life was like for other people.        ",3,6,0.8534616231918335

They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist signed up.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people,he got to see other countries,such as Greece,and Europe.

He also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily,they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke said that helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea,on his second trip luke served as a watchman.

His job was to check on all of the animals every hour.

One time he said he slipped and fell on his backside and his heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening side of the ship,thankfully a sharp peice of metal stopped his slide,or he would have flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive,but he could not work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs.

Luke also found fun on board,especially on return trips.

When the animals had been unloaded,the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

In conclusion, he feels that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure. Luke quotes,""I'm grateful for the oppurtunity,""he says.

What many people may be thinking is there are no reasons. A reason to come is you can see very many exciting sights. Also its a one in a lifetime thing. If you are a sports fan then this is a thing fro you. They play baseball and voleyball.

Now its not done yet because someone out there is probably wondering what kinds of sights. A very facinating sight is the Pacific Ocean. Thats right when entering the Seagoing Program a sight you get to see is the Pacific Ocean. You also cross the Adlantic Ocean.

People are probably just wanting to know a little bit about the program. It is a very long program but it is enjoyable. There are also animals on the ship and if you are chosen to night wachman you have to check on the animals every hour. If its someone that likes animals then that person might enjoy the job.

7123d48,"Have you ever wanted to travel around the world and help people and animals at the same time? Well you can if you join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is an excellent program to join because of the experience, jobs you could do, and the cost.

Most people have a great time on this trip because they can visit many places and sight-see while they are helping others and animals near you. I have visited places like Greece and Italy. I got to ride a gondola in Venice and visit an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. When we were dropping off animals, we had time to play games like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. One night, I was on the boat and I got the job of being a night watchman for the boat and the crew. Since the boat was full of animals, I had to check up on them every hour for the entire night.

To be in this program, there aren't many requirements to get accepted. The requirements are that you have to have a diploma from the high school you went to and you have to be devoted to helping animals and humans around you. You also have to show respect to the captain and our crew members and you must show good character toward many others.

Luckily, there isn't any cost to be included in this amazing program. I was working two part-time jobs which were a grocer and a banker before my friend, Don Reist, invited me to travel the world with him in a cattle boat. The boat I got boarded on was the SS Charles W. Wooster and we were heading to Greece and 335 horses and hay were on board. It was obviously an interesting and marvelous experience.

To sum up my thoughts, boarding the SS Charles W. Wooster and signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys program was the best decision I have ever made and it was the best thing that has happened to me in my entire life. With the experience, cost, and job options you have on the cargo ship, it is an excellent choice to make. I'd suggest that you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program in the future.

Also, as a Seagoing Cowboy you don't just take care of animals, you can also help people that needs help. By doing their jobs for them. When cowbys are done putting animals that had been unloaded they get to do their fun games, like playing baseball and vollyball games!

Luke is brave to do this cause a lot of people just are scared to go across the world.

The bravery shown in Luke is when he goes to diferent places around the world in Europe. Even when there is a terrible storm upon them.

You will be able to see new people, meat new people and go places that you've never been befor all while going to help people get some things back after a war, whitch is the right thing to do.

You might like to build thing, and if you do you should be a seagoing cowboy. When you have free time on your hands you can do what ever you want with in in reason. When you have no animals to take care of you can build more, or you can play games. Some of the games are: boxing, table tinnise, baseball, softball, fencing and whittling. All of the games are really fun.

Some people want to become countery people, but they don't know how to take care of animals, but if their willing to lear than they should become a seagoing cowboy. Other people just like to take care of animals. If you are one of those people then a seagoing cowboy is the right job for you.

Being a seagoing cowboy might be hard, but at the same time it's really fun.",3,6,0.8309444189071655
722e307,"Seagoing Cowboys program is a once in a life time oppertunity. You get to be with animals, get to ride in a boat, and also get to see many archetectial designs, such as the Great Wall of China or the Eiffel Tower. If you ever get the chance to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program, I suggest that you do.

Seagoing Cowboys lets you stay with animals when you ride in the boat. When I was working, I got to work with animals such as horses and cattle. There are many animals to work with. There are also many things that you must do for the animals. You must feed them, water them, and clean out their stalls. The animals usually eat oats or wheat. Animals can be hard work, but they can also give you something fun to do.

Seagoing Cowboys program is all by sea. You pick up the animals on land and then, you set sail and hit the water. If you have never ridden in a boat, then I suggest that you take this oppertunity in life. Boats can be very fun. They rock back and forth like a rocking chair and float on water. Boats are proably the most important thing that we need for the journey. If we did not have the boats, then we are out of luck.

If you have never seen any national landmark, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to try to see a landmark. On the trips I have taken, I have gotten to see the Acropolis, parts of China, and have done and seen many other things. One of my favorites was riding in a gondola, in the city of water, Venice. The landmarks are important because they remind us of friendship. For example, France gave us the Effiel Tower to us as a peace treaty? Well, now you know.

The Seagoing Cowboy program lets you be with animals, get to ride on a boat, and gives you the oppertunity to see national landmarks like the Great Wall of China. So know that you know more about the Seagoing Cowboy program and what you do, think about signing up at the age of 18 to participate.",4,6,0.8277332782745361
72718b7,"Here are some reasons people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You get to move cattle,travel places,help people.

Traveling would be fun and here are some reasons why. Places, you could go to asia and see their art, or Europe and meet the people. Food, you could try exotic things like goat or fresh Polish sausge. People, you could meet new people and hang out with your new best german buddy eating goat.

Moving cattle would be fun ecpecially if you grew up doing it just like Luke did. You could get smarter by doing this you would know how much of what to give a horse or a cow for feed, and you would know how to clean a stall. If you ever retired you could go into cattle from this experience.

If you did this you could have the experience of traveling and cattle but the best one would be knowing you helped all those people stay alive milk and meat from the cows meat from the goat. everyone would love you for giving them food and milk to eat and drink to keep them alive.

In conclusion those are the reasons why people should become Seagoing Cowboys. It would benefit you and those people who need food and water.",2,6,0.8752754330635071

To support Luke's claim, in the text it states that, ""To help these countries recover their food supplys, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relif and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of horses, yound cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

To conclude my essay, here is some infromation about Luke and Don's journy! For fun they played: volleyball,baseball, table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games. They also played them to help pass the time. The trip also made Luke ""aware of people of other countries and their needs. For Don's expirince it was almost the same!",2,6,0.6285305023193359
72c9aa8,"Peaple should join this program because you will learn about what the passage is about and write what you think its about. So,Luke was a cowboy that rode over seas. He rode the Pacific Ocean 18 times. No one's ever rode the Pacific 18 times. He started ride the seas in August,1945. When he was heading for greece he was 18 years old.

So,I think he rode the Pacific 18 because that was how old he was turning. But it wasn't that he wanted to ride the seas he rode the seas because World War II in Europe so, I think Europe was is homeland. Luke had found many countries in some ruins. The countries were running out of food supplies so,since Luke was generous he gave them the food supplies they needed even animals. How nice was that of Luke. Luke wanted to help them more so he told them to get in the ship.

Luke was incredible he made nine trips. It took Luke to cross the Pacific two weeks. So,If you times the two weeks it took him to cross and eighteen times he crossed is thirty-six weeks to cross the eighteen times. The ate and drank water but they had to be fed twice a day or three times a day. They played basketball and volleyball. Where the animals were housed there was more games to play like table-tennis but only tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,wittling,and other games. Being a seagoing cowboy was harder than having a adventure but thats Luke opinion.

Other peaple will have different opinions like adventures are better than being a seagoing cowboy,hating doing both,or not noing what a seagoin cowboy or a adventures does.",1,6,0.6542254686355591

There are animals that need fed and you can do every night or even be a look out for whats coming ahead. The trip is fun but dangerous. You have to go on a boat that moves back and fourth. The fun part is that you can stay up all night and you get to never wake up unless its your job to feed the animals.

Luke's claims are having fun and being with his best friend. Luke also knew it would be a lif time opportunity. Luke was watching out for ahead and checking on the animals then he went to tell captin that when the ladder was wet and slippery. Luke fell and his heart pounding like a hammer. Luke was almost dead but he wasn't he broke a couple of ribs but hes fine he and work for a couple of days.

I dont know if i would join sounds fun too. Joining the prograhm was to help for world war ll also. The war was tough because there was a lot of stuff ruined by it too world war ll was a desaster but we thank the people that were in it. If you do join the progrhm they call you ""A Seagoing Cowboy"". Luke and his friend were happy that they were still alive. ",2,6,0.6750145554542542
734036e,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than just taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls for the animals.

Doing this, it could open up your eyes to a new world and explore new places.

Luke though it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

The fact that Luke thought helping all of those people in need, shows you that he wanted to help them.

But, not only was he taking care of the people and helping them, he was also helping the animals. I think he also liked taking care of the animals himself.

When people think of a Cowboy, they see someone wearing cowboy boots and riding a horse.

They also see a farm with a whole bunch of animals.

If someone is a cowboy, they normally like animals and taking care of them.

Like also liked the trips coming back. They played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that also helped pass the time.

You also got to visit unique places.

Luke got to go to Greece, China, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete.

He also marveled at the Panama Canal, during his trip to China.

Since Luke didn't just go once, he must have enjoyed going on the trips and helping people.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy can open up a new world to you. Not only does it let you visit new and unique places, you get to help animals and people that are in need of it.

It sure was like that to luke.",3,6,0.8359385132789612
73599a7,"In 1945, World War ll had just ended. 44 countries joined to create the UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Administration. The UNRRA is an administration that helps a country that has lost quite a bit in the war. The UNRRA helped countries that lost food supply, animal supply, and more. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to help care for the horses, young cows, and mule that were going to be shiped to other countries.

I think that there are many reasons that people should join the UNRRA. The first reason that I have provided for you is that This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The second reason I have is because even though you will be working you will be able to spend time with animals and you will see many sites that you would not have seen if you would have stayed home. The third reason I will provide is that not many people can do big oversea trips like that, a lot of people get very seasick. My final reason is that you would know you would be helping innocent people. You would know this because not everybody is in on these wars in fact most people are not in on big wars because they know it will tear apart their family.

I think that there are some claims that Luke has made that I should share. I think that one of Luke's claims that I should share is he said, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."". I think that he could support this because a lot of people, families, homes, and countries are destroyed and seperated. Another of Luke's claims was, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Accropolis in Greece was special."" I think that this can be supported because this would be truely amazing. I think that he did a good thing to choose to help the UNRRA, but being able to see Europe, China, and Greece would be incredible.

I think that Luke was a very incredible ""Seagoing Cowboy"". I think that some details to suppot this are that he lasted 9 trips to nine different countries. This is incredible because that is the longest any ""Seagoing Cowboy"" has ever lasted. I think another reason he is an incredible ""Seagoing Cowboy"" is because he decided to help the UNRRA. I bet that at the begining he was extremely nervous and I bet that he wanted to go home to his mom, dad, and siblings if he had any. My last reason that he was incredible is that he kept working even if he got seasick, or if he wanted to go home. I think that work was one thing that he used to get his mind off of things he worried about.

There are some thing that he could've done on the positive and the negative side. First, on the positive side, I thinkthat if he really set his mind to it he could've been a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" for at least 10-12 trips. I think that some benefits to staying longer would be that you would've been able to do more sight seeing, also you would've been able to spend more time with the animals. One thing that would be negative is that he would've gotten seasick more times than without staying.

I think that I would've signed up for this opportunity because I love animals and I really like being on the ocean. I think that this would be a great chance. I think that they should have things like this in 2016. I think that there are a lot of countries that could use something like this, one that I can think of off the top of my head is Syria. They could use all the help they could get, they could use food, shelter, animal products, and animals in general. I think that I would think the same way as Luke. I think that me and my friends would all sign up and we would do everything together. We would care for the animals together, we would eat together, we would sightsee together, and lastly we would take breaks and stop together. My overall thought is that this would be great but it would also be extremely dangerous.",4,6,0.576338529586792

If you are looking for work, this would be an amazing job that will change your life forever. You will need to put in hard work and dedication, but this job is worth it all.

Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will be doing a good service. You will be helping countries and the people inhabiting them. For example, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals..."" This is a valid reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. Not a lot of people get the chance to help an entire nation by bringing them cattle, mules, horses, and food. If you are worried that you will not get any free time, don't be. You get to sightsee whenever you land in port and experience very amazing places and things such as the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. An excerpt from the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" would be ""Besides helping people, you have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Another benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that it opens your eyes to needs in certain poor countries, or countries devastated by disaster. In addition to that, you have to put in a lot of hard work and dedication to feed and take care of the animals onboard the boat. But ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy is the opportunity of a lifetime.""

Intoduction

Luke had turned 18 before he arrived in Greece, he said"" I could be drafted for military services"" ( paragraph 4). It took Luke to get across the Atlantic Ocean eastern coast of the United States 2 weeks, and 1 month to get to China. Luke had made a least 9 trips, more than any Seagoing cowboy. By the time it was 1947 Luke had helped people he said "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China"" ( paragraph 5). Luke had visited Venice,Italy he rode a gondola because the streets were water. He also "" took a tour in a excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canalon his way to China"" (paragraph 5).

Reasons A few reasons why you should to join the program that Luke is in because 1: he is a night watchman. That seems exicting because he gets to watch over the animal.2: he got to to visit a whole lot of places like Venice, Europe, China, and the Panama Canal. 3: he was on a boat so he got to visit the places like Europe and China. The last reason is to keep himself busy is caring for the animals during th crossing.

Body What Luke likes about being Seagoing Cowboys is he metioned that this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. When he first got on the boat he was exicted to visit the coolest places. The First one he visited was Greece that was the place they headed first. Then it was Europe that was where the boat was headed toward. Venice it is last he said "" So was taking a godola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water.

Conclusion They are so manythings that Luke learned that ws really acurate of being a night watchman. Like helping people benefit of seeing Europe and China. Going through new expirence places like Europe, China, Veince,Italy. I am sure he probably visited more but, who knows. Luke learned that they'res a lot to handle of being a military watchman.

Second, you can also lead your family to host a number of insternational students and exchanhe vititors for many years.

They sailed on a ship for two weeks to ship to bring animals Luke was mostly busy by feeding animals but when he didn't have anything to do he boxed,Table tennis,read books and whittled. Luke was 18 when he got to Greece and he got draft. Then they told him to keep doing what he is doing for his service and he was climbing a ladder and feel off and broke his ribs. He didn't have to go to work for a few days he also visited China,Europe,Venice,Italy and he tour a castle in Crete. Also he toured The Panama Canal.

You're not one of those people. I am here giving you a chance to become one of us. I know you're probably thinking to yourself ,""why should I do that?"" or ""what is a seagoing cowboy?"" Well before I was here, I was working two part time jobs when a good friend of mine invitted me to come onto a cattle boat with him so I did.You'll be amazed at what we can do and what this job can teach you!

A Seagoing Cowboy is when peopel get on boats or ships with animals such as, horses,sheep e.c.t. We take the animals and the food to the destination and drop them off. Now it may sound ""lame"" or ""boring"" but it actually is fun and interesting. You play some games with your shipmates,when we go to a destination for example, Greece you could go sight seeing or just walk around but we do not have to get on the ship directly after work is done! We get to have loads of fun. Which is why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy!!

When or if you decide to join me and my friends you should know what exaclty you're getting into. So we'll start with where we go. We go all around the world for a matter of fact, we've been to Greece, China, New Orleans, Venice,Europe, and we saw the Panama Canal.Some advantages of being one is that , one of course you get to travel to so many places and see and experiance so many new things.You meet awesome people who will become life long friends.Not only that but the pays not bad either.

In all you get to have me as a caption which is an automatic plus, you get good money, you are helping others and you get to travel for free with amazing people who can teach you incredable things about life.

If you still haven't signed up i think you're crazy. This is your lastchance for the best adventure of your life with memories that will never leave you.I am glad that i was able to recruit si many young people who want to help out in the world.Thank you so much and remember all of the good things that will come when you sign up to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you make many friends. You get to help take care of horses, cows, and mules. By 1947, I made 9 different trips, the most of any seagoing Cowboy! Not only do you have fun doing all of this, but you also get prepared for hard work in the future. You also play fun games such as volleyball and table tennis. We also fenced, boxed, read, and whittled to pass the time. Being a Segoing Cowboy makes you much more aware about the world and its people. There are many things countries need. You also have lots of fun on board, especially on return trips from unloading the animals. All of the fun on board made the month long trip to China seem short. When I was in Greece I even got to see the Acropolis! It was very special. I also turned 18 before arriving in Greece, so i could be drafted in the military. We finally arrived on August 14, which was the day the Pacific war ended!

First, i say you should join this prgram because, you get to see people from different countries. You also get to expierence what its like to be on a cattle boat and meet new people that have joined the program as well. Maybe you might even get a special job on the cattle boat like being the look-out. You also get to be out on the beautiful sea.

Secondly, there are the opportunities of sight seeing, and exploring, you might also see ruins of places. Luke Bomberger got to go dight seeing a bit and see Venice,Italy while taking a gondola ride and the streets of the city were filled with water. You might even be able to go for a swim, now wont that be a splash.

It might be a long trip but it would be worth it. Its fun to explore and see new places so enjoy the opportunity while it lasts or just say yes and start your .

journey

Lastly, and most importantly, you would have to care for the animals. You would have to check on the animals every hour. You would aslo have to feed the animals, which are mostly horses and a few cattles. Tending to the animals is also an important job, you would hhave to care for them from one destination till the next, and it would be bad if they were sick since you didnt take care of them, but you should know it will be fun tho care for these animals, they are very gentle loving creatures.

In conclusion, there are many great facts and reasons to join this program just look what Luke Bomberger accomplished! You could accomplish many great things too, maybe you could cross the Atlantic ocean and break the record for crossing the Atlantic more times than anyone ever has before.",4,6,0.7563396692276001

To help theis countries to bring them food,supplies,horse,cow, chicken and mules to help to survine.

Luke clains is that he go on the boat and left it took them to past the pacific ocen.

The body is that Luke made it to china so they play game and have fun and they go the mules and cow they was happy and in china they got food for them and there family is very happy and some people does have a home and they build home for them and some people got hert and they lost there family and they are realy sad and they are thankful that they are alive and Luke filled bad for them because they don't any home then Luke went back to his home and he was happpy.

He wanted to help the countries recover their food supplies, animals and more. There would be 44 nations that would join up together to help the countries in need that they were going to.

In August 1945, they recived their orders to report to New Orleans. They had 335 horses in the cargo plus enough hay and oats to feed them. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. They were caring for the animals during the crossings. Luke said,""Besides helping the people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because there are countries that are in need. What if our countrie didn't have food supplies, or animals, or other things that we need to survive. If we helped their countries when their in need, then they would help our countrie if we were in need. That wouldn't be good if we won't share what we have that they dont have.

If we don't help the countries that are in need, then we might have another war because they would be angry at the countries that have all the things that they don't have. Also what if there were terrible storms that would wipe out all the people that don't have shelter in that countrie. See we have shelter that would protect us from dangerous storms and we also have money to repair what the storm did. But they dont have any money to buy shelter. They also don't have any food to eat, but we do.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help the countries that are in need of. It's not fair if we have something that they don't have and we won't share it. If you don't want to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys progran, then you could also donate some things that you have to the program.            ",3,6,0.761268138885498

There are many things to like about it.

Some examples would be; you are helping people, you get to see new places, and you have a lot of fun while traveling!

On Luke's trip, the Seagoing Cowboys, he helped the countries whom where in ruins after World War II, as it states in paragraph 2.

The atricle states World War II had just ended in Europe.

The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys so they could take care of the animals such as; horses, young cows, and mules.

Paragraph 2 states they shipped these animals over seas.

Another thing to enjoy about being a Seagoing Cowboy is, seeing new places.

Many people enjoy seeing different places and the intresting structures built there.

Paragraph 5 tells us that, Luke got to see Europe and China.

It also states he toured an excavated castle in Crete on his way to China.

Lastly, the boys had fun while traveling.

Pargraph 8 states, they played baseball and volleyball in the empty holes where the animals had been housed.

They also had table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and more to help pass the time while traveling.

Luke had a great time in his days as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Not only that, you can even find a family and settle down and have kids,but before you say yes and sign up for this cowboy program that sounds incredibly awsome and jump on the ship and die for some super crazy reason,it won't be my fault. There are some dangers out at sea and I can tell you how to avoid them. Step 1,if you see some people come aboard from diffrent places try to stay away for a little because you dont know what kind of disease, or sickness they could have. Say you bring a little bit of medicine if you get sick and you become best friends with someone from China or Japan and you or him didn't know he brought a deadly disease aboard and if you catch it,your more than likely going to die, so keep watch if someone is coughing or sneezing. Step 2,Try not to get night watch,the reason being is that if you fall overboard there is nothing anybody could do for you because you will be out there all alone. One of the best things about the trip is that you get to go to new places and you can get new stuff. Like if you go to like Japan and all the other places you can get new plants,inventions,new farming products and many more. The best part is,you can sell it. In the story it says that he did because they sort of needed him and he wanted to help. If you do go you wil not only be helping other people you can be helping even more by bringing new ideas and farming products and you can even tell them how to properly farm or even how to farm.

It was a unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, (He mentioned in paragraph 4) not only did I help people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe,China, and Acropolis in Greece which was special. I also got to care for animals (as mentioned in paragraph 6). Helping out at aunt Katie's farm prepared me for hard work but not for the dangers of the sea (as mentioned in paragraph 7).

When I was serving as a nightman on my second trip, I still checked on the animals every hour (as mentioned in paragraph 7). One rainy night I injured my ribs but didn't fly off the ship and though I still couldn't work for a few days I was happy to be alive (as mentioned in paragraph 7). I had a fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The other cowboys and I played baseball and Volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed (as mentioned in paragaph 8). I'm grateful for the opportunity and I t made me more aware of other people of other countries and their needs (as mentioned in paragraph 9).

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a amazing opportunity for everyone because you can travel around the world. You can see countries like Greece, China, and other countries. You can see marvoules land marks like the Panamal Canal, and you can see important countries like Acropolis, Greece and Venice, Italy the city of water. You also can meet other people around the world, and help the people in need. As former Seagoing Cowboy said '' I'm grateful for this opportunity.''

The next reason why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is becuse you can see animals that you have never seen before. You can also take care of them until you reach the country that there supposed to be in. The next reason is that you can eat foods in other countries. You also can also be one of the reasons why some of the destroied countries are now one of the best countries in the world.

Then here is the last reason why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy, you can also use up your free time. Seagoing Cowboys like to have fun they play games like Baseball and Volleyball. Then in the empty rooms were the animals were housed is now a Baseball field, a Volleyball court, a Table-tennis room, a Fencing stadium, a Boxing ring, and other games.

I think a lot about others believe it or not. I love other people and apparently Luke did also. He understands the true meaning of love. He even knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime to help people in Africa,Asia,Haiti, and other places like that he had to understand that time is too valuable and other people give that time away to you to make you a better person and he is using it that way. Not saying this is all good there is downs too. Every rose has its thorns.

It is a lot of time that people spend with others. It was better for Luke I think because he was a good person. He had a heart of steel to make himself not say no to miss out on people in his family to go help other families. I think that was the best thing to do for anybody. He missed his mom,dad,aunt,brother/sister,nephew/neices,and his other friend to go help other people. Which makes me wonder if he's a Mason.

I know that he had to miss out because that was so much time taken up ,not wasted but taken up. He spent 2 weeks on each trip and then did it 16 more times! Reasons not ot would be. You could die in fog. I'm not sayin I wouldn't go but I wouldn'tlike to have the thought of dying in my brain. I bet more than once or twice he thought of dying and cried.

I know I would go but I wouldn't go 16 times because of the fact. There are sharks,squid,octopi,and plenty of other animals. The oceans are the most unexplored places on earth. People die millions of times a year because of the ocean and I have a high paranoia level so my paranoia would keep me on my toes. I would be so scared at times. There are 60 foot sharks named megalodons and can swallow me whole. There are plesiosaurs confirmed in the pacific. There is a six gilled shark that is 20 feet long. almost all sharks can taste a drop of blood 400 yards away. If they swim underneath a boat with 335 horses and 1 of 335 is bleeding or in labor. (the tissues and blood)I would die. I would probably have a heart attack.

I can't stand my paranoia. My friend was going to let a train go over him to prove he wasn't scared but I put a little paranoia in him because under a train gets hot enough to crystalize a rock and make it look like silver. What would it do to my friend. Back to the water.

Plesiasours started as lizards. Lizards have a third eye. It senses changes in lighting. Ripples and vibrations shift lighted areas. Horses make alot of noise and stomp alot. Stomping causes vibrations.

I was swimming in a river and I thought about rivers monsters when a log touched my legs I freaked out! I swam as fast as I could screaming ""jeremy wade jeremy wade""I was out of the water and on my grandpas house boat. I said hit the sand dam. From then and on I never went past clear water.

I don't think about stuff like look down its a log or stuff like that. I almost pee my pants when I see a spider. I think its because of me watching national geographic channel everyday and knowing what every animal does and how it hurts you.

I thought one time a jamaican cockroach could kill me .At the time I was three or four. My finger now was about as long as this cockroach. it stood up and it ran towards me. I was in my moms work and there were alot of animals there so I ran into the pig room. That was the day I figured out my mom would get me a mexican rat. From then on No roach came near me .But my fear is still here.

I was working at a grocery store and a bank. When my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe with him on a cattle boat I couldn't say no. I knew it was an opportunity of a life time!

What we were doing was for the countries that were left in ruins we have to give them livestock so that they don't die of starvation. On the two month jouney I turned 18 before reaching Greece. That meant that I could drafted for the military service, but when they found out I was on a cattle boat they said to keep doing what I was doing for my service. By the time I was discharged in 1947 I had made 9 trips (more than anyother seagoing cowboy). That is what I did for two years.

In the passage it says ""It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China."" To me i don't think i would be able to stay on a boat for two weeks and a month its jsut alot of sitting down, and you dont get any rest. Its alot to do when your travling for two weeks and a month.

My argument about Luke's point of view is that it would seem pretty cool to sail and go on journeys with Luke.

He seems like a person who would love people to come along with him on his jouneys and help him explore new things, and keep watch for things, animals, and maybe people. Luke just seems like a very active person who loves people to help him explore.

I think this because he's very very active and he likes to explore. He enjoys his doing what he does if he can travel for more than two weeks. If he can explore and help out . That really shows that he loves his job.         ",2,6,0.7875658273696899

He might have joined because he wanted to help other people because he might have wanted to help load the cattle and not hang out with his friends but if he were to travel to anouther place away from his friends he would be sad and so would I.I dont blam hiim for being able to cry and wine like a little girl but we all have our own ideas. He wanted to change his life by doing good for otherr people and not just his self. Luke wants a experiance adventure with the seagoing cowboys but he cant do that if he dosnt have experance.

Luks parents wouldnt let him go if he didnt argue with them. You know why he wouldnt have arguied with his parents they might have sugested him going over to join the seagoing cowboys. That is why I think he should go.",2,6,0.7131469249725342

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you would be helping animals that weres shipped overseas. You would be helping animals such as horses, young cows and mules. You would be feeding the animals, giving them water clean their stalls and you would have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats to the lower holds of the ship.

7837555,"The Great Opportunities of Seagoing Cowboys

""He knew it was the opportunity of a lifetime"". The Seagoing Cowboys program lets us help countries in need of food, animals, and much more. People should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because of the traveling, the experince, and the opportunity to help others in need.

First of all, Seagoing Cowboys get to travel around the maginficent world. Some might say that it is not worth it because they might get hurt, however,they travel overseas, letting them see the marvels of the oceans.We can also tour an excavated castle in Crete and see all wonderful places at the Panama Canal on their way to pleading countries. In my opinion, joining has its benifets. You can awe at many beautiful places, and might be inspired.

Secondly, the experience would be wonderful. Some will argue and say that you might not even have an experinece at all, but in my belief, anybody can have an experinece during your time at the program. We sail all over the gigantic world and help hundreds of pleading people. You can take a gondola ride in Veinice, Italy, and see the Acropolis in Greece, which was very special. I believe that the experience gives us a lifetime of memories after our journies.

Finally, being a Seagoing Cowboy gives us the opportunity to help people in need. Some might say that you can get badly injured while trying to help others, but it is vital to say that it is more important helping people in need. It is the oppertunity of a lifeime. The cattle boat trips were unbeliveable opportunities for a small town boy.We get to help contries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. Join the Seagoing Cowboys because we get to save hundreds of people, which leaves a good feeling in us for helping others.

In conclusion, others should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because of the traveling, the experince, and the opportunity to save others in need. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure, it opened the world to us. If you want to help others, please consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.   ",4,6,0.8832722306251526

One reason you should join the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' is because all of the amazing sites. When I was part of the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' I had the opertunity to see a lot of amazing sites. I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Another reason you should join the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' is because all of the great times we have during free time on the boat. There is a lot of free time on board exspecially during the return trips after the animals have been unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

You also get to interact with a lot of animals. While you are sailing It takes about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings keeps you busy. They have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls have to be cleaned. Although it is a lot of work, when you are doing these things with the animals it forms a bond between you and the animal.

There are some reasons why you should join the ''Seagoing cowboys Program''. I hope you will take the oppertunity to atleast look into the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program''.      ",3,6,0.7816131114959717

For example in text, Luke found as much time as he can to have as much fun. Him and his cowboy friends played baseball, vollyball games, etc. They also had some tournaments, like fencing, boxing, reading whatever they can think of to pass time.

Some more infomation from the article is The boat ride was fun and they had chances of seeing countrys like Europe and China and Greece. They took gondala rides in Venice, Italy, In the streets with water. If I was there i would enjoy myself more than other. Even in after the war in Europe was over left in ash and all they still went to the cities.

In conclusion this shows that you should participate in alot of things, Because you will never kniw what will come your way. It happend to me, my friends, even you one day.

One reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you get to help countries in need. The Seagoing Cowboys are a part of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminstration, and provide countries with cattle that the countries might not have because of war. You also get the opportunity to visit many gorgeous and fascinating places. On my trips, I got to visit Europe, China, Venice, and even the Acropolis in Greece, and many more locations. If you like to travel and see new areas, then becoming a part of the Seagoing Cowboys is an opportunity of a lifetime. Even if you're not very into traveling, but you like working with animals, joing the Seagoing Cowboys is still a great idea. On the trips, you spend the majority of your time working with horses, young cows, and mules, which can be a wonderful opportunity for a fan of animals. But the trips aren't all work. You can still fit in time for fun and pass time with a lot activities, such as baseball, volleyball, fencing, whittling, etc. Even better, though, you can become more aware of people in other countries and their needs, which can make you more sympathetic and kind to people who are from different countries, especially countries that are poor and aren't the best places for people to live. These are just a few of the reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

As I stated before, the Seagoing Cowboys is a fantastic opportunity, and if you ever get the chance, you should join as soon as you can. You get to help out countries in need, visit many beautiful and unique places, and get more experience on working with animals. The trips are also quite fun, and there are many activites that you can do, especially after the animals have been unloaded. You can even learn about people in other countries and their struggles, which can prevent you from being ignorant, and that awareness can make you kinder.

Last you get to work with farm animals. I feed the horses and give them water. After a while you make a strong bond with these animals and take care of them like they're yours. It's hard work because you have to fed them three times or twice a day.

I knew that it would be neat experience, but it was more that just a neat experience. It was a wonderful and unique experience, the people I worked with were wonderful.

How long did it take to get there? What if I don't like the jobs there and the people are rude? Are the jobs boring? What if its not the same as it was when you were there? I don't like those kind of jobs where you have to go overseas.

It took a while to get there, but it was worth it! I got to explore unique places and unbelievable sights. Working there keeps you busy, but you get to work with great people and the jobs are usually fun even if they sound boring.

Is it a unique adventure getting there? What if I don't like the way they do things and your telling me a different story?

When my friend told me that it would be a neat adventure, I got excited, but it was way more than that, we rode in on a cattle-boat, so we got to explore the Panama Canal and much more! Being a Seagoing Cowboy allowed me to experience unique places and an important thing is, it made me more aware of people and their countries.

The job also wouldn't be hard if you already know how to feed and water cattle. You wouldn't be doing your job every second.You do have to feed them two or three times a day.You also have to clean the stalls, paragraph six states this. When your done doing your job you have free time to do games and look at the ocean,paragraph eight has this included. You're also not alone you can make friends with whoever works there. If you work as watchman you have to check all the animlas each hour.

This program could help with your future, you could be asked to do the same job on a diffrent ship with a diffrent crew. Or you could be asked to do something that pays more. However you could be watchman instead of caring for the animals.

There are some cautions that could lead to danger. When it get's rainy the ladder can get slippery and you want to be careful to not fall off the ship. Paragrapgh seven includes this information.

I am about to tell a few reasons you should do it. Here are some If you like animals, if you like exploring, if you want money, and even if you like to try new things, this would be a great thing for you.

the first reason is if like animals you would love this job. We take care of cattle. You get to feed them, brush them, clean their stall, and even lead them off the boat. You have to take care of almost 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them.

Also if you like to explore the world around you this would be a good opportunity to do so. We have visited Europe, China, and other places. I seen the Acropolis in Greece, I took a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the panama Canal on my way to China. There are some other reasons to join the program.

Another reason is you could get paid. You could get payed by the trip or you can get paid every hour. I do not know how you get paid or how much you get paid. All I know is if you want money then join this program.

The Second to last reason you might like this is because we travel far distances. If you like to travel you should do this. It took me and my crew about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Even if you do not like long distance trips caring for the animals will keep you busy.

The last reason is we can still have fun by playing games in our spare time. Me and my crew play Volleyball, Baseball. Table-Tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

I hope you read this and thought it through. I am glad you took time to read this, and hope to see you on one of my trips. We will have fun orking with the animals together. Hope to see you There!!!   ",3,6,0.7896485328674316

Seagoing cow boys are pepole that go on ships with animals such as horses,mules,and young cows that were shiped over seas because of war.

One of the reasons that you should become a seagoing cowboy is becasue when do you ever get a chance to go all around the world for free? As you aborad the ship there are some resposibiltes such as feding and watering animals,and pulling up bales of hay and bags of oats from the holds. Because of war the animals have to be shipped to many places like China,Italy,and Greece. Sence your on the boat with the animals you also get to vist these wonderful places. Its like a opportunity in a life time.

On the way back you may think there well just be a whole bunch of vacant spaces full of hay. You also may think a vacant area is usless,and boring without animlas living in it. But this is not the case. On the return we fill in the vacant spaces with fun activites such as volleyball ,baseball ,boxing ,tabeltennis, reading,and Whitting. So this makes the way back as much as fun as it is on the way there.

Seagoing Cowboys help animals, mostly horses, donkeys, cows, and mules, that are being shipped overseas to avoid harm get to their destination. Are you thinking that you maight like being part of this program? Here are some other good things about being a Seagoing Cowboy.

As I said before, you can help animals that are in danger and get to know them. This gives you a good feeling of helpfulness and compassion. I love to save lives, especially if they're animals'. I also liked to be freinds with them. Even though there are many other people on the boat with you, the creatures all have their own personalities, and this makes them fun to hang out with.

Another good thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you get to see the world. I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and an excavated castle in Crete. I have been to Europe, China, and Italy. You can go to all of these places, see these sights, and more if you join their program.

Fianlly, there are so many people on the boat with you that it is impossible not to make a friend and have fun almost every day. I have made ample new companions. There are also many games played on the ship. They include baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, reading, boxing, and whittling.

When Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy it was much more than an advernture even though he did travel a lot. Luke was very greatful for the opportunity. Luke saw that other countries don't have a lot of stuff like we do. He saw that they where in need. That awareness stayed with him almost his whole life.

For example, being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure, ""it opened up the world for me"". Another example is that the cowboys played many enjoying games to pass by the time. These two example both show how joining the Seagoing Cowboys program would be a wonderful experience.

In addition, I feel that the Seagoing Cowboys program could have its bad times. It could be unsafe sometimes like the time I fell off of the ladder and cracked my ribs. Courage is a word to describe this Seagoing Cowboy program, because thats what it takes to be a cowboy. Both of these text examples are giving information on how the Seagoing Cowboy program could be difficult at times.

To conclude this argument, we have talked about the reasons to join the program and reasons on why it could be bad to join the program. You can join the program based on the information that i gave you. I hope that you will consider joining the program.  ",2,6,0.7784156799316406
7d62b53,"Are you looking for a job that fits your hobbies but can't find it? Well don't worry, being a sea cowboy offers lots of jobs and opportunities, just ask me, Luke Bomberger. You can care for animals, have watch duty, steer the ship, and many other jobs that are needed when being a sea cowboy.

Just take it from me, Luke Bomberger one of the most famous sea cowboys in America. Thanks to my stories you'll know all the possible careers and benefits from being a sea cowboy. First, lets talk about some of the jobs that probably fit your interest. First of all if you want to watch animals, or nurse them back to health if they get sick then this is the job for you! Normally, on just one ship there can be up to 350 animals. That's a lot of sea cowboys feeding, cleaning, and nursing animals. Not interested you say, then you can ask for some extra watch time. Everybody has to do at least one night watch per night and you could do someone else's work, while they clean animals. This job is perfect if you enjoy getting some fresh air. Just don't be afraid of heights! Still not the right job, then you can take over or be the captain. This job is perfect for anyone interested in being the captain of a boat, for a career. You will most likely stay high up, but you can't accidentally fall to your doom, doesn't that sound safe?

Now you've finally picked your career, good job! Now you can look at the benefits of working as a sea cowboy. It might seem boring on the way to Europe, picking up after animals that relieve themselves everywhere, but with the animals gone and the stalls empty you can play games to pass the time. You could just simply play a board game, or maybe set up a ping pong table that you had to move because the chickens kept pecking away at it. Heres another benefit, while your ship is being loaded with food for the trip back you can go sight seeing! You can see the Panama Canal, or a castle on the island of Crete.

This is marvolous, even I myself am jealous of what you might get to do.

You have now seen the great benefits of becoming a sea cowboy. All that's needed now is for you to sign up, be drafted and not only will America thank you, but all the people of Europe will. Bonjour!",3,6,0.7189091444015503

Another detail about Luke convincing people is to help him go to other places.

When he was going to graduate, soon his life would change. When it was 1945, they saw their seaman's paper. They headed to Greece. When luke turned 18. He could be draft to the military service. By the time he was dischared in 1947, Luke had made nine trips.

Another reason Luke would let you join is he would let u travel with him. It will be a good opportunity. He led international students and exchange visitors for many years. He said it might be difficult for him. It took him time to do everything. he had to check the animals for one hour. He was so tierd. On one night he was a night watchman. Luke had alot of bad days. He had to clean the ship. He was busy the whole time but he was ok because he had food to eat. it was fun for him.

Luke was a kind and brave person. He was really cool. I think he convinced a lot of people to join. It was really hard for him. He had to work and do stuff. He is a nice guy.",1,6,0.7063774466514587

If I was old enough I might what to think about being a Seagoing Cowboy!

Luke's claim was a great claim! Instead of working in a grocey store and a bank he became a Seagoing Cowboy! Even himself he said, '' It opened a whole new world for me'' He helped animals and more when the World War Two happend. He recovered their food supplies. He went accrosed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War two, that would be a sight to see.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have a responsibility to help animals and more! But it can also be dangerous crossing the oceans all the time. If you want to be a Seagoing cowboy you have to be brave and courageous! You need those traites because if that was your job you would'nt want to be nervous or afraid all the time.

Luke had too be brave he had to have a great outlook to kept doing what he was doing, And you can too! His point of veiw was strong. He went on 9 trips and that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy! He also had a cargo of 355 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them! He even cracked his ribs, but he is ok. Over something small but he was brave enough to keep going because he cared for the animals and he loved his job.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowboys! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowboys!

Many people know, and many people don't know about the Seagoing Cowboys.

In the ecxerpt, Luke was one of these.

Seagoing Cowboys are for anybody and everybody.

In this paper, there will be many details describing why Seagoing Cowboys are for everybody.

There are many details to describe the greatness of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

One detail is because if you are one of these people, than you get to take care of a bunch of poor animals.

A few of these animals are horses, young cows, and mules that are being shipped overseas.

You would also take care of people.

Some things that they would do are help their food suppliy animals and more.

Not just for the people, but for the countries that were left in the ruins.

Another detail is that you get to have a great time while you do it.

Luke for enstince, got to hang out with his other cowboys and have fun.

They would play base ball, vollyball games, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

They did these things to help pass some time.

The would also sometimes be able to go sight seeing.

Some people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is dangerous.

Well, there not completly wrong.

Although being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun and adventurious, it can also be dangerous.

In the ecxerpt, on Luke's second trip he had to be a watchman.

On one rainy night, he slid down the wet slippery ladder onto his back.

He shot feet first toward an opening on the ship.

Luckly, there was a small strip of metal on the edge which stopped him from ragging vigourusly into the wet and dark Atlantic Ocean!

After that he couldn't work for a couple of days because he had a few broken ribs.

Yes.

Everything in the paragrapg above is true, although, this only happens every once in a blue moon.

In the excerpt this didn't happen to any other of Luke's cowboy buddies.

So yeah it can get a little rough out there, but it only happens very rarely.

People have alot of fun joining this program and they always have a good time while they are here.

As one can see joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is for anybody and everybody.

It Is an amazing and exiting feeling once you know that your helping animals and helping people affected by World War ll.                                      ",3,6,0.8532300591468811

Someone who wants to help people and animals would want to sing up.

Luke is a very brave person and i support him for that i like Luke if he was ral or if he is i would like to meet him in person to say how much he helped those people he is a very good person to others.

I would join this program to help Luke and save lifes I really like Luke he seems like a very helpful person and very succesful in life he didn't give up on school or those animals or the people who needed him to help and they probaly thank him for what he has done.

I like the fact that the program teachs you resopnsabilty in life how you can't just think about your self and think about others to and be helpful to others and that is just what Luke did he cared for the other people and not just himself and he cared for animals cause if Luke and Don wouldn't have saved them animals they would be dead or extinct.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be very instresing.

Luke is a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke enjoys being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke travels alot while being an seagoing cowboy.

They traveled on cattle-boats, he says it was an unbeliveable opportunity.

In 1945, World War II had ended in Europe.

Many contries were ruined.

UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys.

UNRRA hired them to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

In August 1945, they had gotten orders to go to New Orleans.

That day they arrived, the Pacific War had ended.

In 1947, Luke had gone on nine trips, the most a Seagoing Cowboy has been on.

It took him about to weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States.

It also took a month to get to China. When he cared for animals during the crossings it kept him busy on the trips.

Alough the sea can be dangerous, he liked it.

On Luke's second trip, he was a watchman.

He had to keep eyes on all the animals every hour.

On a rainy night, he acidently slide down a slippery ladder on his back.

He got super scared, his heart raced.

He shot down a slide, feet first.

A small strip of metal along the edge stopped the slide, keeping him from flying overboard.

He had an injury, he had cracked ribs.

When the boys had free time they had fun.

They played volleyball and baseball. They also liked to play table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. They also read.

They helped pass the time when he nothing to do.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can open up a whole new world to you.

The Seagoing Cowboys had to take care of the animals, such as horses, calfs, and mules, that were shipped overseas. Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys with his friend Don. They arrived in New Orleans on August 14,1945. The Pacific war had just ended when they got there.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to see some beautiful cites, and help people. If you like animals, you should become a Seagoing Cowboy beause you spend all of your time with animals. If you want to serve in the military, you can be a Seagoing Cowboy, because Luke turned eighteen before they went to Greece and his draft board told him that he could just keep on being a Seagoing Cowboy for his service. If you like animals too, that would be a win win!

If you have a lot of animals, being a Seagoing Cowboy would be like being at home, but at the same time being on vacation. I will say one thing, if you are allergic to any animals that you might have to take care of, don't join. If you are allergic to the food or the ingredients in the food, don't feed the animals that need to eat that food. If you can't be around it, just ask if you can have a different animal to take care of so that you can still help without having an allergic reaction. If you are a person with no pet allergies, this would be a perfect job for you.

When you are on the boat, it won' t be all work and no fun. Luke found some time to have fun, so I'm pretty sure that you can have some fun too.

They played some other games just to keep them busy.

When I signed up for UNRRA,

I knew it was a once in a life time experience and that I just couldn't past that chance up.

After I turned 18, I could be drafted in military service. So when my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they let me keep on doing that.

When I was discharged, I had made nine trips-the most any other Seagoing Cowboy had done. In my time, the cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveable experience, and other than helping people, I got to tour many places.

Even on board I had a jolly time.

On return trips, the cowboys and I played baseball, table-tennis, and volleyball in the empty animal holds.

If physical activity isn't your thing, you could have still have read, whittled, and played small games. The Seagoing Cowboys aren't just about exploring places and playing games though. The UNRRA opened up the world to me, as it made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.

My awareness has stayed with me as I have lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Yes, I do realize that joining UNRRA can be a risky thing. Even myself had gotten into an accident before, I'm even still happy to be alive.

One day I fell down a slippery ladder on my back, but then a tiny strip of metal kept me from flying into the dark and mysterious Atlantic. With that, I couldn't work for a few days because of my broken ribs. You might be scared to join because of your own safety, and I respect that. However, so many other positive things have came from my experience in the UNRRA to out number that one incident.

In conclusion, I believe you should join the Seagoing Cowboys for many reasons. Not only are you getting adventure into your life, but you're also helping others.

8049c2f,"Luke was a sea cowboy he described every thing wonderful and great but is he just saying that to bring more people in the business .

My first reason that shows that Luke is maybe trying to bring more people to work with him is that in the whole script he only comes across one problem but everything else is great which is hard to believe because in the sea there could be storms ,waves,floods or leaks on the boat but surprisingly he never comes across any of those problems which is odd.

My second reason that shows that Luke is just trying to bring people into the business is in the text it said that Luke kept on saying that he got to ride gondola in the streets of water in Spain,and got to excavate a castle in create , and even got to see the Panama Canal on his way to China so he is basically saying that all of the things he did where fun he got to go siht seeing but not everything he did could of been fun he also had to feed animals and clean stables so not every thing he did was fun.

In conclusion these reasons show Luke maybe is liens but maybe he is telling the truth its up to you to choose a side is he lying or not so maybe just maybe he could be telling the truth.",2,6,0.5758748054504395
8058404,"Most people might not know what Seagoing Cowboys are, but that dosen't mean that you hate it just because of it's name. You should at least participate seagoing cowboys once.

People might not have many reasons to support there statement about ""Why you shouldn't be a Seagoing Cowboy'', but I have at least some reasons as why you should join the program.

One of my many reasons is if you love working with animals then your up for the job. Many of the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" had to take care of the Horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. On pharagraph two it states ""UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that weree shippes overseas.""

If you were to join the cowboys you will have to be able to go away from your family for a while. For example, on paragraph three it states ""In Augest 1945"", and on paragraph four it states ""By the time he was discharged in 1947"", what I'am trying to do is prove my point. Since you have to be away from your family, you won't be able to see your family in about three years. If you can go three years without seeing your familly then you have forund your job.

Besides helping people, you are able to see awsome sighting and go to places that you've never been before. You are able to go and see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Crete, Panama, and you could go to Italy. On paragragh five it states "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says ""So was taking a gondola ride in Vencie, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Luke also toured an excaveted castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his was to China.

So, in conclusion I belive that you can, and should join the Sesagoing Cowboys. Only if you are able to parcipitate very well, and if you won't have a problem with all of those things you have to do.",3,6,0.8187272548675537

Luke claims you can as well have fun on your trip at sea. He says you can play baseball and vollyball. The Cowboys play with them, they played where the emty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis touraments or fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and playing around passed by time.

One reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys is to get to see new places you have never seen. The Seagoing Cowboys is the best to know, when you want to visit a place. If you would join maybe they just happen to go where you want to see or visit. I went to nine trips before I was discharged in nine-teen forty-seven. You can go on multiply rides before you get discharged.

The second reason is, so you can be open to new places. Some people have lived one area their whole life and have never been many places. If they had to move they would not know some things were in the area they where going. The Seagoing Cowboys takes you different places, so you are not in one area your whole life. If you never met some animals then maybe you would get to meet them and even be able to take care of them if you join the Seagoing Cowboys.

The third reason is to learn more about Earth. If you would join the Seagoing Cowboys you would learn a lot more about Earth and the places that are on Earth. When you get know more about Earth then you become smarter and know more about whaat can happen. The Seagoing Cowboys program helps you learn a lot more about animals and wildlife. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you can definitely be like me and make nine trips and learn something new everytime. If you can not take that many trips you still can enjoy it and learn.

I think overall it is that I had a great time. I think you should join and then maybe you will have as much fun as me. If you join then you will have to learn about animals and learn how to take care of them. If you do join Seagoing Cowboys make it useful, and help you learn more about the Earth, be open about Earth, and see new places. If you want to learn more about these things then you need to join Seagoing Cowboys.",3,6,0.8341024518013

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy! There is so much to do. For instance for all those people that enjoy sightseeing will like this job. One reason is because in my time being a Seagoing Cowboy I have already seen Venice Italy with streets of water. I saw an excavated castle in Crete. The best sight though was the Acropolis in Greece. Like I said there is so much to do.

If you like animals this will persuade you. In this job I get to spend all my time with animals! And there are animals you don't typically watch like horses and just different kinds of cattle. Also you can wacth them at any time because the animals are indoors. You can't beat this job.

This will persuade you if nothing else has. All you do in this job is travel. You get to travel totally free too. The only thing stopping people from traveling nonstop is the cost but here it is covered. You go all over the world as well. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 18 times and the Pacific twice! This is my favorite part of the job I hope it is yours too.

You can't refuse being a Sea going Cowboy now. Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is the finance. You get paid to travel to all these amazing places. Boat travel is something a lot of people want to do but can't because of the price, however if you are a Seagoing cowboy you get paid to travel by boat. Lastly you save money because you don't need lots of accesories at home since you'll be traveling the world. This job has no flaws.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a blessing. My friend persuaded me to do this job years back. Now I am passing on the tradition and I hope you do too. Again help me in the Seagoing Cowboy program you won't regret it a bit.",4,6,0.7886277437210083

Today, he would encourage more people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is a very great thing to do and you can travel and visit many places you have never visited before.

When he was doing the job, Bomberer visited several places including, China, Europe, Greece, Italy, Crete, and Panama. Out of them all, Greece was the most special to him.

Luke knew what an amazing offer it was from the beginning and he knew he couldn't turn it down. And he would encourge you to join because if you ever thought abut joining the military they would accept you and let you serve by being a Seagoing Cowboy.

In conclusion, you should become a Seagoing Cowboy because it gives you opporunities, palces to travel to, experiencences , other jobs, and different culturers to endure and discover and make you a person who has seen and done amazing things that other people cant say they have done.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is people that help recover food supplies for places that just got done with war and to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. I think it's good to help people in need. There are three rerasons why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Those reasons are that your helping people in need, to expeariance other countries culture, and to for the adventure and amazing views.

The first reason why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that because your helping people in need. It is good to help people in need because it shows other people that they are loved. It is also good to help people in need because they just been through a lot. They just been through war, and war is not pretty. It is also good to help people in need because it shows that you care.

The second reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that its good to expeariance other countries culture. It is good to expeariance other countries culture because it is good to know what they do in there country. It is also good to expeaeriance other peoples cultures because it is goood to know how they live or if the countries poor. The last reason why you should expeariance other peoples culture is that it is fun to learn new things about other countries.

The third reason why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys is for the adventure and the amazing things you get to see and expeariance. You get to go to China, Greece, Europe, Crete, italy, and many more countries. It would be fun to see The Great Wall of China, or the Panthenon in Greece, or other amazing sites in other countries. It is a honor to see an amazing site that most people don't see everyday.

In conclusion, I think it would be really fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy. It would be fun to help people, expeariance other peoples culture, and see amazing sights. People should really consider being an Seagoing Cowboy.             ",3,6,0.8587324619293213
8121481,"The Seagoing Cowboy program is hard work but it is pretty fun. You get to help people that endured the 1945 World War 2 restock on food, animals, and more. All of us together make 44 nations that have joined together to help the people in need. The Seagoing Cowboys were part of the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) organization. A Seagoing Cowboy will take care of the animals including the horses, young cows, and mules that are on board. You get to see amazing monuments and you get to sight see and have fun. This is an opportunity of a lifetime so you should join this amazing program.

One of the reasons that you should join the program is because while you are working, you get to enjoy the wonderful views that the ocean gives you and you get to see building that you would have to pay a lot of money for. I got to see Europe, China, and the Acropolis in Greece. When you are having a bad day you can just look out and see the beautiful sunset and marvel the sights that you can look upon.

Another reason is once the animals are unloaded, you are able to find some time to yourself and have fun on the ship. You are able to play baseball, volleyball, and tennis. The Cowboys also did fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass time. You would find an empty stable and gather a few people to play with you.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboy program to help the UNRRA. You will enjoy having lots of fun with us but not only that, you can see marvelous evenings and daylights.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time."" Before all of that Luke and the crew took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. When Luke and his friend Don they were sent right to work. Luke was a little ahead of him self becaus he helped out his aunt Katie on her farm as a boy , but his chalang was the dangerous seas.

Now Luke was in his early 20s and he was on his second night of wachman job, that ment that Luke had to check the animals every hour. It was a rainy night ,he was making his hourly report to the captin. on his way down he sliped down aladder on his back. Luke shot feet first to an opening on one side of the boat but a small strip of metal stoped him from falling into the dark, cold,tarorizing Atlantic.

He had crackend a couple of his ribs. In Lukes life time Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Being Sea going Cowboy is much more Than a great time its an opportunity for you it giving you achance to see the word, and it shows you how much we are given in are country than other people around the world.

That awareness stays with you forever like it did with Luke Bomberger. After you do this you can tell stundents and others about what you did to help others ,and you might even make an impact on others. For being in his 20ntys Luke was a smart young man for what he did.

Helping other people is awesome because then they look up to you. Caring for other animals is kind as well because then they will start to trust you and other animals will do the same.

Luke claim is it is an apportunity of a lifetime and it's an adventure, you get to freetime and do cool things, and it will open the world to you. Before Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy he worked two part-time jobs he worked in a grocery store and a bank. His friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe in a cattle boat. Luke thought this was a chance of a lifetime and he couldn't pass it up so he went. When Luke was on his way to China Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal. Now thats an adeventure and it shows how he had free time to do that. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger as he says. He says it opened the world for him. It allowed him to get a bigger picture of the world, and see what it was like. He says he is grateful for the apportunity and if you get an apportunity like that you should be glad to.

One reason to join is that you help animals travel from one place to another. You will be helping European and Asian countries recover their animals, food supplies, and more. You will visit many countries helping them recover and saving animal's lives as well. And I was happy with what I was doing.

As I said in the first paragraph you will travel to many places. You will able to have some free time when you are at a country because I got to travel to Crete and see an excavated castle and also marveled at the Panama Canal. It was fun to travel all over the world to help people.

On this trip I learned my way around a few countries and how it feels to help people just because you want to. You might get hurt along the way but at least you are doing what is right. By doing this I was drafted into the military when I turned 18 and when they learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. So as I did I saw how much distruction wars could do. By that I became aware of what people need.

To sum up my thoughts, I think you should join The Seagoing Cowboys Program because you are helping animals and people, you visit many places, and you learn things along the way. And I have exprience of getting hurt during these trips but that should not stop you from helping your world go through horrifying events.

Firstly on the starting bell, I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy because you can travel anywhere for work and have fun. Evidence from the text that supports my opinion is that Luke headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses. Also, Luke passed the time with table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games. Both of thiese examples show that he had a lot of work to do but when he finishes early, he speeds op time with fun activities.

On the other hand, being a Seagoing Cowboy could be helpful at a young age because when you are 18 when you start and quit at 24, you could have some skills that could be usefull for an other job. Evidence from the text that supports my opinion is that Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. As well, Luke had to feed the animals two to three times a day. Both of thiese examples show that if you become a Seagoing Cowboy and quit, you could be very good at your job if you become a zookeper afterwards.

My conclusion for this essay is that if you join the program, you could be informed by going to new places. Also, you could get new skills that could be usefull in the future like feeding animals and cleaning. If you do decide to join the program and become a Seagoing Cowboy, be aware of the risks but in all together it is a good idea to join.",3,6,0.789991021156311

After we would drop off the animals we would have played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournements, fencing, and boxing.

That is why you should join the seagoing cowboys. This is a lifetime opportunity to do this. Don't miss out on this.

When I couldn't think of a reason to say no I went with him. I'm glad I did because if I hadn't I wouldn't ever have become a Seagoing Cowboy. You can have many things if you become a Seagoing Cowboy!

Instead of my service I became a Seagoing Cowboy and got animals across the sea safely. I washed them and cleaned them over and over but in all those chores I got to travel!

I got to see Europe, China, Greece, and Italy! I was a small town farm boy and then I got to see all of these places, all because I became a Seagoing Cowboy! You can become one too!

I'll admit that there are some dangers in becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Once I almost fell overboard and broke my ribs! I wasn't able to do anything for the animals for a couple of days but they kept me company. Even though becoming a Seagoing Cowboy has its faults it overall is very exilerating and makes life an adventure! You can become a Seagoing Cowboy just like me!

If all that doesn't satisfy you, this will! When there are no animals aboard to take care of you can play games to pass the time. These games include baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, and table tennis tournaments! When you are playing these games with all the other cowboys you tend to make cowboy friends almost immediatly! You can sign up right now to make new friends and play games with them!

All in all the Seagoing Cowboy experiance was the best experiance of my life. I hope that everyone gets the chance to have this experiance! You can have adventure to make you feel alive. You can have tourism to let you have experiance across the world. You can have games and new friends to keep you company and help you pass the time!

After World War II was over, many countries were in ruins. 44 nations picked in to help the countries and they needed Seagoing cowboys to help the animals that were stuck in sea, so Luke and Don signed up to help.

They found a bunch of horses first with a number of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Luke made nine trips which was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town,"" Luke says. He toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama canal on his way to china.

It took a month to get to China, but they finally got there. Caring for the animals they rescued kept Luke busy. It was more than an adventure for Luke. It opened the world to him.",1,6,0.7308353185653687

They should join the program because it is a great learning experience. It would allow people to work hard while having fun. It would be a positive experience for those people.

First of all, it would give people experience working with animals. They would be able to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are being shipped overseas. They would learn what it takes to keep the animals alive. Taking care of the animals would be a beneficial experience for those people.

Next, they would be traveling constantly and getting unbelievable opportunities. They would also be able to have some fun. They could have fun by sightseeing and playing games with the other members. It would be a mix between working hard and having fun.

Finally, they would learn about people in other countries and their needs after a war. They would be able to help those people by giving them animals, food supplies, and more. They would see what it is like to live in another country after a war. It would be a great experience for the newest members of the Seagoing Cowboys.

In conclusion, the people who join the Seagoing Cowboys would have a positive experience. They would be able to work with animals, take care of the animals, and learn what they need to survive. They would also be constantly traveling, and they would work hard and have some time to have fun. they would learn about people in other countries and their needs.

If you joined the Seagoing Cowboys you could help a lot of people and yourself. I strongly think that you should join Luke in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for boys. In order to join the Seagoing Cowboys program you had to be a boy. You where in the Seagoing Cowboys program for as long as you wanted but, the highest was 9 trips. They take care of all types of animals and you get to go all over the world and see many different things.

First thing you do is to go over the seas. Next you find where you need to go so you can go and help the area that have animals. Second you have to help people and animals by taking them to a safe place and trying to help them with everything you have. Lastly you go back to find more or go to a new place to help new people.

Helping is a good thing for all people but, you can also look around the places you are. For example, you get to go to Greece and help cargo 335 horses and all so look at the place. Lastly you could get many items to bring back to remind you of going and helping the people that need it the most and by going somewhere fun.

If you join the program then you get to meet many different people and try many new things. But, going only for fun is not the main reason. The main reason of going is to help people, animals, and other things. It is World War 2 at the time and many animals and people are trying to help them selfs but, they can't and that is why you should help them and join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

These are all my reasons talking about why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you joined this program you could help many people and also help yourself in many ways. I extreamly think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys in there adventures and having the experience of your life helping many people in need.

I think that joining the UNRRA( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation

UNRRA about hiring ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of young horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas. UNRRA was formed to help Eroupe and many countries that were left in ruins by World War ll,to help these countries recover their food supplies , animals, and more .

In August 1945, I had recived orders to report to New Orleans. The day I arived was the day the Pacific war had ended.

I got seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W.Wooster, heading to Greece with cargo of 335 horses im addition enough hay and oats to feed them . My birthday had passed before arriving to Greece I had turned 18 which meant I could be drafted to military service . By the time I it was 1947 I had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

I got to see many new and cool things on my trips . In the passage it tells what I got to see on my trips in the passage it tells "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing

Europe and china . but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says . So was taking the a gondola ride in

Venice, Italy , a streets of water."" I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama

Canal on my way to China.

Although, joining this program can sometimes be very dangerous. From high waves and huge thunderstorms, to slipping overboard and getting very wet and ice-cold.

I went to Greece, Europe, China, Venice, Panama Canal, and Acropolis. I've been many places as a Seagoing Cowboy, maybe you should try it too.

It may have taken a while to get to those places but it was still quite fun. I had my friend, Don Reist, along with me. Don invited me to tag along with him. How could I turn it down? It was going to be the opportunity of a life time!

The sea can be dangerous too. I remember that one rainy night, after making my hourly trip to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped my slide, keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. I was happy to be alive but, I couldn't work for a few days since I had cracked my ribs during the fall.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy means that you can help others who were hurt in World War II and need food suplies, animals, and more. I'm so grateful for the opportunity I had. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. This awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years.

On the return trips I had lots of fun! My friends and I would play Baseball and Volleyball games in the empty holds when the animals were unloaded. We would have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the games helped pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun, dangerous, and helpful to others.

Think about how much fun you'll have losing but having fun winning and having fun when playing games with the others. Also getting to help others who need.

I had a great time knowing that all the work I was doing was saving lives and helping others, and it made me look at things at a whole different perspective. I still learned more about livestock, even though I am a small-town farm-boy. I learned that life isn't perfect for everyone, and that I was taking my living conditions for granted. These things have made me a better person.

It moved me to see all of these people living in ruins. Tatthered clothing, rubble everywhere, mass graves, dead/injured livestock, and people were starving to death. The Seagoing Cowboys got over to Europe (and Asia) and reversed a lot of this. It came to my attention that we, Americans, are taking our lives for granted. This was a relatively easy realization to make, as things are in ruins.

I am more sensitive to problems people have and now know that I'm an animal-person. I now look at things through a more ""maybe it's worse"" perspective. This has made me a better friend, better man, and more well-liked. I have made no regrets since my return. I think that once you see someone living in these conditions, you reach out to everyone a little more.

If I could, I would do it again! If you try this, you will leave knowing you made a difference. The people who save lives doing this are heroic.

Luke and his friend Don had reasons to sign up for being a "" Seagoing cowboy"". World war II had now ended and many countries were left destroyed, to help the countries recover from war they will need things such as food, animals, and many other things. To help the people in those countries 44 nations united to form a group called UNRRA ( the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration). The "" Seagoing Cowboys"" were hired to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. In August 1945, they got orders to report to New Orleans. Luke and his friend arrived on August 14th, the same day the Pacific war ended. There was 335 horses to take care of. Before arriving in Greece Luke turned 18, which means that he is now eligable to be drafted for the military service. In 1947 Luke had made nine trips, more than any seagoing cowboy. Luke ended up touring many places around the world. Luke was doing his job chcking on the animals, but this time was different it was raining, Luke accidentally slid down a ladder and almost fell into the deep dark ocean but a piece of metal stopped him fromm falling. Luke was lucky to be alive but he still was injured with some cracked ribs. Although it wasn't always fun, Luke found things to do like baseball, volleyball, tennis, and many more things.

I became a Seagoing Cowboy when me frend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was when World War II was going on. Some countries were left to die and had nothing. So they formed the UNRRA and hired ''Seagoing Cowboys.'' Both I and Don Signed up.

In August of 1945, they recived orders to go and report to New Orleans.''We arived August 14,'' Luke recalled ''the day the Pasific War ended.'' They got their seaman's papers and and borded the SS Charles. W. Wooster. They then headed for Greace.

Before I got to Greace he turned 18 wich ment the military could draft me .''When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip,they tolde me to just keep doing that for my service,'' Luke says.

''The cattle boat trips were an unbeliavable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.'' but seeing the Acropolis in Greace was very speacial. So was takeing a gondola ride in Vince, Italy a city with streets of water.''

It was also hard work. I had to clean, feed, and care for the anamals. I seved as a night wathman, meaning I had to cheak on all the anamals and report to the captin every hour. One ranny night after my hourly report I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside. I was fine but couldn't work for a couple of days because of broken ribs. I also had fun too and played vollyball games in empty holdes and more.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see tons of new places. I got to see places like Europe and China. I also met and created a bond with new people, While I was there I saw new cultures. This program allowed me to be aware of other countries and there needs by not hearing about them, but actually witnessing it. I also had some fun on board with the other members of the Seagoing Cowboys club. We played games like fencing, boxing, and even table tennis.

Now if I told you that the Seagoing Cowboys program was all fun and games, I would be lying. There is a lot of work to do. One time I fell down a slippery ladder. I didn't die,(because if I did I couldn't have wrote this.)but I did get hurt badly and I cracked my ribs. There are many responsibilities while on board. I had to work with animals. I had to load and unload them off the ship. Also on my second trip I was the night watchman, and my job was to check on the animals every hour.

He was helping other animals each and every animal that was hurt in every war that was going on.

Luke recived orders from to go to New Orleans. he did as he was told so he went to New Orleans and helped to take care of th animals as he was told.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a good way to help other country so there country's people can survive after war and other causes. On the Seagoing Cowboys program you can meet new people, and see new places and structures. You can also take animals from one country to another to give one country animals so they can make food so they all don't starve. You can also help make peoples lives better after war and acomplish great things. Just like Luke Bomberger who was just a average town boy then he joined the Seagoing Cowboys program because his friend then he became a hero.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was created by the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). The UNRRA was created during World War 2 in 1945 to help country's effected by World War 2 by destruction. The UNRRA helps by getting soldiers to help fight. They also search for food and animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program helps by getting horses,young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys program headed to Greece with a cargo of 335 and enough hay and oats to feed them.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboy is a good idea if you want to help country's just like Luke Bombberger did by brining animals you can see different places and meet new people.",3,6,0.8214911222457886
86befef,"Do you know what a seagoing cowboy is? Luke Bomberger was a ''seagoing cowboy'',a person who helped foreign countries of sea's after WWII. Luke was apart of the UNRRA, (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)to help foreign country's who have been left in ruins get back on their feet. On his way to Europe,he had to cross the large and vast Atlantic Ocean.

To pass time on there way to Europe they played games such as,Table-Tennis,fencing,and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass time. The way Luke got into the seagoing cowboy business,was his friend asked him if he wanted to join him,and he couldn't pass up this surreal oppurtunity. But, the downside was he he had to travel the rambunctious sea's. The ship Luke and Don boarded to take these cattle over to Europe is the SS Charles W. Wooster.

Reasons join this program are that you get to help others get back on their feet in times of disaster such as war,hurricane,tsunami,nuclear disaster,or other types of disasters that may happen. But their also some dangers to be aware of. During one of Luke's journey's to Europe he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. If it weren't for a small strip of metal he would have fallen into the dark Atlantic Ocean. But,besides broken ribs he was glad he wasn't sleeping with the fishes,literally!

It's also an adventure to. During another one of his trips he got to boat around the watery ""streets"" of Venice,Italy in a gondola. Also while in Greece he visited a excavated castle. He also marveled the Panama Canal on his way to

China. But,what came most in handy is that he used to help his Aunt Katie on her farm as a boy so, Luke was prepared for the hard work.

So as a conclusion to this story, I would hope you join an organization that helps others in need, especially countries overseas. Even though this job might be hard, your making a difference in our world and there's. You could join an orginization like UNRRA,or just simply join and orginization that helps new Americans,like immigrants from foreign countries fit in in our society today in America. That would be a good example our country could set for other countries. This should be our goal for every thing and anything. Are goal should be to help others and just not ourselves. We need to stop being selfish and help other's get back on there feet if their in times of need. This is the example we should set as The United States of America.",2,6,0.7692615389823914

Being a Seagoing Cowboys, i've done nine trips and each one of them was amazing. I went to China, Greece, Italy, Europe and many other wonderful places aroud the world. Each trip was amazing! Well here's a list of what are the advantages of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

1. The Seagoing Cowboys is a corperation that gets horses from all around the world. If you join today we could make our ship bigger to carry more horses and that would mean, new horses and new people on board!

2. When your on board you'll get to take care of the horses, play games after the horses are dropped off and see the scenic view! It's an opportunity of a lifetime! But be careful, you can slide off board! I once almost slid off board, but luckily I was careful and didn't fall into the icy, cold ocean!

3. You'll get to meet new people, you'll get to explore new lands and you'll get to help new people. Plus, if we go to Venice, you'll get to go on a gondola, like me!

Well I hope you become a Seagoing Cowboy, like me! And if you do sign up, just have fun, do your work and remember, you'll have to clean up after the horses! ",3,6,0.8502681255340576

I'm trying to get you to join. Sure it may be hard work but you can still have fun and visit different countires. Maybe you and your friend can both become a Seagoing Cowboy. Alot of people can join maybe a dozen people can join and the people you don't know you can become friends with them. If you become a Segoing Cowboy I bet anybody no matter the gender can be a great Seagoing Cowboy. You should join I set the new record for visiting nine different countries and I want to see if you can beat that. You might just might be able to learn to speak a different language and you can test your friends to see which language you are speaking. In plus you get to hang out with animals like horses, or cows, or mules. You also get to work for UNRRA which is a great federation. But you have to have a college degree to become a Seagoing Cowboy or you can never join. Make sure to get good grades in highschool as well that way the UNRRA knows that your right for the job. If you become a Seagoing Cowboy than you would be able to explore the world go to the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and many more.

You can go see China.

As stated before helping people is an other benift. You deliver people cows, mules, horses.

I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat I couldn't say no because I knew that it was a lifetime opportunity. In the year of 1945 World War two was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins and Don and I signed up to go on the seagoing cow boy adventures.

When we got our seaman's papers SS Charles W. Wooster, we headed for Greece--with a total cargo of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece and meant that I could possible be drafted for military service. When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. By the time I was discharged in 1947, I had made nine trips---the most of any seagoing cowboy. ""The cattle-boat trips wre an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.

You can even get a job doing cattle-boat trips where you take trips to other countries that are overseas. While you're sailing overseas you can stop to see a famous landmark as long as it's close by. Such as Luke, it states in the story where he went to go sightseeing in between trips. ""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Also where it states ""Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

My second reason is that you get the experience of helping people and their country. It tells you in the story, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can help your personality too, it can make you kinder, and help you show humility. It also says in the story "" And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

My final reason is the experience of making new friends, and having fun with them. You can make new friends in different countries, also people that you work with. Some people that you become friends with can become your best friend for life. It states in the story what fun things you can do with them too, "" Luke also found time to have fun on board , especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

Now some people think thats long but it's really not.

They got to china from somewhere in the atlantic ocean in a month.

Not to long right.

The cowboys go to places for jobs and then the play games or go siteseeing its not all just work they have a ton of fun.

The cowboys liked to have fun too.

After unloading the animals they play baseball,volleyball,table tennis,and they read and box.

This can give you great oppertunities as an adult and a kid.

Some of it wont be fun you will have cetain jobs, but sometimes it's better to do hard work instead of play. From what ive said so far are you intrested?

Some of the jobs are even fun and majestic.

If your a watchmen you get a majstic site of what your around.

If theres danger your going to be the hero because you would warn your team about everything that is going on and tell them to turn around.

In some of these jobs you get to work with anaimals and that could be fun because you really dont do alot of work.

The most you have to do in that job is clean the animals and feed them thats it.

Now to me being a seagoing cowboy sounds like an awsome and fun job.     ",3,6,0.8022217750549316
89a47b1,"In this writing prompt, I will tell you as to why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will explain the duties of this program and the perks and finer points of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

In paragraph one, the last sentence, it clearly states why this program is so highly valued. Luke knew this and it states, ""He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" This is simply an opportunity of a lifetime. In paragraph one, it had stated what Luke did before he became a Seagoing Cowboy. It had changed his life and brought him away from working at odd jobs for the rest of his life.

A second reason as to why this program is extraordinary is that you will be able to make a difference in someone's life. It states in paragraph two, ""...many countries were left in ruins."" This was after WW II. People needed help and, ""The UNRRA hired 'Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

Besides helping people, the Seagoing Cowboy program also enabled a golden opportunity for new sights and knowledge. Luke states in paragraph 5, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" You will get to see Greece, Italy, Crete, the Panama Canal, and other spectacular places on your journey across the world.

If you are an animal lover, the Seagoing Cowboys will also provide a wonderful time with the creatures onboard. Horses, mules, cows all need to be taken care of. While this is hard work, it will be worth it.

The Seagoing Cowboys program also provides some fun in the cowboys' lives. In paragraph eight, it says, ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time."" This program has multiple perks and activities you will discover when you join.

And last of all, being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't just an adventure. In the last paragraph, it says in a response for Luke, ""It opened up the world to him."" Luke says, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" This awareness can help you throughout the days of your life. And for Luke, it says, ""That awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and echange visitors for many years.""

In this writing prompt, I have explained why being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience to have. You can help people and animals, have fun, sight-see, and develop your sense of character. you will be able to change your life immeasureably. In the end, the experience can make you into a better, more compassionate person. This concludes the writing prompt for the Seagoing Cowboys. ",3,6,0.8329626321792603

Well then tell me replied the man. It's a great and exsiting adventure were you go on a boat acrost the Atlantic or the Pacifac and help the contrys in ruin by bringing animals and food for the animals.

Well but don't you think that I could do more by just donating money asked the man. When you donate money it gets spit up and a small percentege of the money goes to each indevidual contry in need. However with this program you can help a country very effectivly by bringing hundreds of animals overseas at a time. But that sounds like much more work than just donating money. If you join the seagoing cowboys you will get to see many exsiting things and you will be helping more than you could if you just donated money.

Well I do have alot of spare time on my hands since I got fired from my job and nothing else to do said the man. Well then you can join the program and help the countrys in need.

The artical never mentioned a mom or dad.

Was Luke alone with no communication skills.

I think you shouldn't join the Seagoing Cowboys because you wouldn't get to see your family for as long as your with the Cowboys. Yes, it's an adventure but you could get sea sick or worse home sick. If you get home sick you may not know what to do.

You wouldn't want to go out in the sea, unboard animals then go back to main land. No one wants to do that. To many people would get sick and not want to go back on board and that would just put more pressure on you to do more work. You won't know if you have a certain amount of time to do certain things on the boat, who knows.

Luke may have loved all the adventures and great times, but that's only one person's point of view of the whole idea. You would need more oppinions in order to see if it is a good service to work for. Everybody may say joining the Cowboys is an amazing idea but others may say it's a terrible idea. How much money does it cost to join the Cowboys, They never mentioned that either.

Luke's particapation the seagoing Cowboys was amazing in his mind but thats his mind not yours. Choose wisly on whether you want to join the seagoing Cowboys. It's your desicion not Luke's or anyone elses.      ",2,6,0.8386083245277405

I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helpping people with there problems make me super happy and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it. For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy.

I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.

So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.

I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.

So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.

I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?

After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said "", Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor ""sleeping"".

He woke me up and said are you ok and I said yes and so I tried to get up but I couldn't and then I relized that my neck was broken.

So I was rushed to the hostpital and I had to get a neck brace and let me say that thing was a pain in the my neck. I was sent back to the ship and so I could work so I asked were are all the horses. My best friend said we sent them back. I said okay, I didn't really care about that. At this point I dint care about anything. A few weeks past and I was able to get back to work and I didn't have to wear the neck brace anymore. The captine said"", No more working nights anymore"".

8a950d3,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is awesome. When your over sea, you can do all kinds of stuff. You can feed the horses, clean the stalls, and when all the horses are dropped off you can have some fun. Basicly, you can anything you want. I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

When the horses are around it's a pretty easy job. All you have to do is feed them, water them, and clean the stalls. Simple. You feed the horses hay and oats. Give them fresh water and clear their stalls every 1 or 2 weeks. It's a pretty easy job if you grew up on a farm.

Being on a boat, we have to make stops along the way. That is when you can go sight-seeing. On our last trip we were going to Greese, we stopped at Venice, Italy. I saw all kinds of cool stuff. I took a grandola ride down the streets of water.

But when all the work is done, and we are all on our way back to America, that is when the fun begins. The other cowboys and I do all kinds of stuff. We play baseball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass time. Sometimes we even play volleyball in the empty horse stalls. Its a lot of fun being a Seagoing Cowboy.

With big orders for horses it might be hard but there are some small orders which are real easy. All in all, it is a fun job. Sometimes the trip is long, somtimes the trip is short but it is still the greatest job in the world. I think no job could be any better.

I know this because I got to explore an excavated castle and the Panama Canal on my way to china. I also road a gondola in the Venice, Italy streets of water. We also had to go to Greece with a load of 335 horeses plus the food and i got to see the Acropolis. I also got to play baseball and vollyball with other cowboys when they returned to give the animals back.

Another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to help countries that are in ruins from World War 2. I had to help recover food supplies, bring back animals, an help repair. Even on the ship you have to take care of animals, such as horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped over seas. You had to feed them, give them water, and clean the stalls.

Sometimes you have to serve as a nightwatch, I did. I had to check the animals every night and make shure they were ok. I did make a mistake and slid down a slipery ladder and cracked my ribs but that was my fualt.

I would suggest anyone who loves adventureing with a friend and has always wanted to go on a adventure some where but couldn't. Or if you just like helping people, and animals recover from the war. This is the program for you, join the seagoing cowboys today!",3,6,0.8912317752838135
8aadd66,"In this essay I will be writing a detailed argrument convincing enough for others to join the Seagoing Cowboys progam. Soon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. This all changed his life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to his first trip for Greece. While he is there he finds beautiful landmarks such as when he saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. He had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Bomberger has also had much fun on these trips where he and the cowboys played games such as baseball and volleyball when there was empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table-tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowboys got a lot more expeirence working with animals, especially barnyard animals. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" sure learned a lot from these trips.

For Bomberger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" was more to him than an aventure. It was a life lesson.",2,6,0.807257890701294

Well why not be both with our Seagoing Cowboys program. I did it and it chaged my life forever.

You can enjoy being the best of both worlds while helping others.

It may be dangerous, but so is everything else. People need us, but we need you to help us.

You may wonder why should I help people I don't know? here are some of the things I saw and did that you will be able to do too.

You can see many parts of the world like China or Europe.

Also you may see Acropolis in greece or take a gondola ride in Venice.

Maybe even Italy with sreets of water, or Creete with its Panama Canal.

Also if you are 18 or older this counts as military service, and when it comes down to it it's more safe to deliver suplies on a boat than be in the battle lines of war.

Plus You are helping people around the world by delivering important suplies like horses, young cows, and mules. Though you will have to feed alot of horses you'll be ok. I fed 335 horses and I was ok.

In concusion that is why you should be a seagoing cowboy. You will see parts of the world you never seen before, you'll be serving your country, and you will help people around the world. Join and you won't regret it, I didn't and you wont ether I promise. We need more Seagoing Cowboys for our program.

This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.

I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.

Also, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Relief and Rehabilitation). I had the side benefit of seeing

Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.

It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.

I was busy caring for the animals during the crossing. My job was to check on the animals every hour. I also found time to have fun on board. We played baseball and volleyball .

In conclusion, i learned that after i graduated high-school life got harder, but i cant let that get in my head. I will face lifes challenges and will overcome them. The trip wasn't about what did, it's about what you learded and its about the adventeur.",1,6,0.694594144821167
8b09ca0,"I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because, You get to see and visit many cool or weird places that many people may never get to see in their life. You have a lot of free time after you clean the stalls, feed, water and groom the animals. With a lot of free time on your hands you have a lot of time to play games such as, Volleyball, Baseball and other games. A cool thing I have learned about being a Seagoing Cowboy is like me, If you turn 18 while on The Seagoing Cowboy progam, and you're able to be drafted, if you do manage to get picked, being on the Seagoing Cowboys Program counts as Military service.

When you join the Seagoing Cowboys you help people in need. You help people in need of food, and suplies to survive. Being a Seagoing Cowboy opens the world up to you and makes you relise that there all many people all over the world that need help. The UNRRA signed people who didn't have very good jobs or good pay and made them Seagoing Cowboys to help others trying to recover from wars and other disators.

While being a Seagoing Cowboy I had to check on the animals every hour to three hours. Cleaning stalls and feeding all the animals takes up a long period of time. You had to get down loads of bales of hay and oats which ment you had ot be strong. You also need to be careful around the ship and being on the ship, you could get hurt by one of the animals or something could happen to you like what happend to me, I fell down a slippery ladder and got caught by a metal peice hanging on the boat, I did crack a few ribs but I didn't fall into the ocean.

It takes long periods of time to go from country to country or from state to state, or even to the other side of the world to help someone in need, so you need a lot of paitcene for those long periods of time being a Seagoing Cowboy. Caring for the animals while going to diffrenet places kept me very busy, whilst still having planty of free time while abord the SS Charles W. Wooster. It takes bravory and gut to be a Seagoing Cowboy, being on the ocean for very long periods of time, not being able to see your family, not having the greatest of food and resorces, all to help other countrys, or states in need.

8b44b6b,"Have you heard about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy? Well if one has I think that one should join because, it is really fun and there are a lot of perks of being Sea Cowboy. First off, after staying on the boat for a long time you dont just sit there on the way back we do a lot of different activities. Second off, If one gets drafted for service in a war, this could count for it. Last off, on ones way to a destination you get to see a lot of different old or prehistoric buildings that where made way before you were in the world. Now for why you should join being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Do you know how is said earlier that when you're done doing the load of animals? Well if you remember then we do a lot of fun games and other things. First of all, is we get to play a lot of sports such as baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. Not only do we get to do sports activities but we also get too do acedimic things, for example reading. And lastly if your a more calm type of person we even whittle a little bit with our free times. Now for why it counts torwads doing service in the war.

You're probabley wondering why it counts torwads your service in the war? Well it counts for your service for a various amount of reasons. First, it counts for your service because you can spy on what the enemy is planning to attack us with. Also, It counts for your service because you can stop them from making any devious plans to attack america. Lastly, it will count torwads your service because, America could sneek in some there devious plans through live stock if they needed to if they couldn't come up with any other ways to attack the other country.

One may be asking right now well what kinda places you visit on these livestock trips to other countries? One might get to visit a bunch of prehistoric building or you might even see some of the newer landmarks but they are still pretty cool. First off, you will see a lot of prehistoric building or landmaks that we do not have in america. Second of all my reasons you might see some cool brand new buildings or landmarks that you can not visit in america. Now onto my reminder on why all this is true.

Remember, this is all true because you are hearing from a man who has experienced it all fom his adventues in the deep sea in many different oceanes throught the world. Like the pacific and atlantic oceans. First off, it is a first person perspective so you havve to believe its true.",4,6,0.837353527545929

You get to play games, such as volley ball baseball, and table-tennis. Also fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling games. The other guys will play with you and things like that. Luke also is with his friend so you can talk to one of your friends. An if they wanted to do it with you.

You get to see different kinds of animlas. He gets to go to a whole bunch of different countries that got destroid. So they may need to take a girrafe or a monkey you've never seen before. You also get to take care of thoughs animals, and pet. You kinda get to be the owner of the animals.

You get to help different countries out and see different things. Like Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece. He got to take a Gandola ride in Vinece Italy, a city with streets of water. He also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal. He was happy that he was able to help people out.

Luke would want people to join because joining forces with countries to help other countries is something that is helping the less fortunate countries. Some peolpe just think their going over sea to help other people and that's boring,but, when your heading back home you can use the empty space that you put the supplies in for fun activities. I think people should join the UNRRA(the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Assosiation).

Next, Luke would want people to join because you never know what you might learn over sea. You may learn how to do things you never knew how to do like fishing or you might learn about the different countries you go to and you could share that knowledge with your friends when you get home. You could even visit muesems and see things you never knew existed. The things you see could inspire you to make something compared to that and it might be in a muesem one day.

Finally, Joining the UNRRA

is a great oppurtunity because you can do and learn thing you never knew how to do and learn you never knew about the country you might be inat that moment. You could visit muesems and see acieneit artifacts. You could see famous art pecies painted by really famous painters.

They hade a long trip their they got there on August 14 1945.

It was the day the Pacific war had ended.

Luke was 18 before arriving in Greece so he could be drafted for military service.

In the text it states that when the draft borad hade learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to keep doimg that, he made 9 trips.

A sea going cowboy is the perfect thing for you and before you throw this book down let me tell you why. One of the reasons is you get to help other people around the world. To add on to that you get to take care of all different animals.

In this paragraph Im telling you about taking care of the animals. You will have a cargo of 335 horses to take care of . They will give you a lot of hay and oats to feed them all . Every hour you will have to go check on all of them to make sure there ok and that they aren't going crazy. You have to get them water 3 times a day . That will be cool and fun because you will never be bored.

After all the horses are gone You and the guys or friends can play tennis ,boxing,fencing and even read if you would like in the horse housing.

Now I am going to tell you the good about the towns and the cities . You get to get off the boat and go see some things like if you go to greece you can go see the acropolis .

I went on 9 trips in the Seagong Cowboy pogram. Baseally all you do is help people and go on trips. You help people by helping with there animals,unloaded the animals.

They also have some fun time too. I found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We cowboys played baseball and vollyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

Some reasons to join the program are to help animals such as horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. You will also get to go to unique places. Some places you might get to go are New Orleans, Greece, Venice, China, and many more.

Luke had turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. ""They got their seamans's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them . ""When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made 9 trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

""The cattle-boatr trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. Also "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

You an even take a gondala ride in Venice, Italy, or marvel at the sight of the Panama Canal. You can see th Acropolis in Greece and castles in Crete. But those are not the only benifits. Even tough taking care of animals is hard work, you still have time to have fun. When we unload the animals, We often do things to pass the time where we used to keep them. Games like baseball, volleyball, and even table-tennis tournaments.

We sometimes do boxing, fencing, whittling, reading, and other games.

The Seagoing Cowbys program gives you many oppertunites. Us cowboys take care of horses,young cows,and mules that are shipped over sea. You have the benifit of helping other people and seeing other countries such as Europe and China. Exploring the way of life in other countries is amazing.

Being a cowboy is more then helping animals and having fun. When we travel we become more aware of other countries and there needs. This job gives you many ways of helping others.

There are many reasons to become a cowboy. You can be someone who helps not just animals but others if you sign up. Being part of this program may change your life and give you more of an eye opening view of the way people live in other countries.

You can raise animals. Like cows because there are alot of young cattle on the boat. There is 335 plus horses on the cattle boat plus loads of food so you can feed them which is kinda helping them live so they can help other people that were affected by world war 2. Plus the cows can give them meat and milk so they can feed their famliys.

Plus you can have fun on the way home by playing games. One of the games are baseball/softball which is played in the place the horse and cattle were. one other one was table tennis which is basically ping ball but was called table tennis. We also did tornaments with the table tennis. There was also boxing. reading was also a option with whittling wood was also a nother free time.

One of the best reasons for going on these trips are the place we went like china. You had time to tour the city you went to on the boat. so you go to new places on these trips like to castles fameous citys and things you can think of. I went to so many place on this trip so i hope you do too.

In conclusion i say you go on these trip because they are fun but dangerous i cracked a few rips on a night shift and almost fell overboard too. so don't get to excited because you can get super hurt on these things because i didn't get hurt to bad does't mean you can't get hurt that bad.

8e49acb,"Have you ever read the story A Cowboy who rode the waves? I know I have, it's a book about a boy who is invited to Europe and he becomes a Seagoing Cowboy after World War 2. This book includes being a Seagoing Cowboy, the Seagoing Cowboy has to take care of animals on a ship and a boy named Luke explores

First, the Seagoing Cowboy, a Seagoing Cowboy is a Cowboy who takes care of animals over sea or on a boat. The Seagoing Cowboy in the story was no different he took go care of the animals. Everyday he watered and fed the animals 2 to 3 times a day. When Luke first became a Seagoing Cowboy he knew it was going to be alot of hard work so he worked as hard as he could. I can infer that if Luke had not took good care of any of the animals they all would be dead.

Next, Luke Bomberger explores, in the story,it states that Luke visited Europe, China and he explored the Atlantic ocean. and also the text states that Luke also found time to have fun aboard the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. I can infer that if I was a Seagoing Cowboy I would not survive working as hard as Luke did.

Last, Being a Seagoing Cowboy,by reading the text,being a Seagoing Cowboy is alot of work. In the text it says being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened the world to him. And in Luke's own words he said It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs. Also being a Seagoing Cowboy can be dangerous because when Luke was night watchman on a rainy night, he slipped on a ladder and cracked his ribs but thankfully he didn't fall in the Atlantic ocean because their was a small strip of metal along the edge of his side. I can infer that if that small metal strip was not there Luke would most likely be dead.

Now you know how the Seagoing Cowboys worked, how they took care of animals and how Luke explored. Now, if you want to achieve something like Luke did then get out there and show everyone that you can do what you dream to do.",3,6,0.7855708003044128

Another reason why you should join the seagoing cowboys program' you get to see differnt kinds of people. the text also stats it made me more aware of people of other countries and their need. Also it will make your family to host. The text stats and that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

8e57d69,"Have you ever wanted to be a sea cowboy? If so let me tell you a little about it. Being a sea cowboy can be a lot of fun but also a lot of hard work.

Being a sea cowboy is alot of fun.

I mean if you love animals especally horses than this is the job for you. You get to be with horses and feed them. Horses are vert nice and big cuddly animals. If you are an animal lover especally a horse lover and a cattle lover than you should enroll. If you lived on a farm or worked in one and found it somewhat fun taking care of horses than this is the job for you .

If you enroll you can also be all around the world like the first time I went I went to Europe and even China after some time. If you like traviling than this is the job for you. If you like being on a boat than this is the perfect job foe you. If you like being on a boat and love animals especially horses and sea animals than this is a good place for you becuse you might even get to see some dolphins and other sea animals. And if you get bored of looking at the water or searching for sea animals don't worry you still have horses and cows.

Once you unload the animals you can still stay active even if you dont have to clean the stalls or bruch them. For instance on my way back i got to play volleyball and baseball. We would play games and everything.

This is NOT a boring job. For instance you get to be in the outdoors or indoors, you get to be with animal, and you also can be looking out in the sea.

This even counts as a military service like for me it also did. After i enrolled they told me that I could stay there and it would count as my service.

So like i said before this is NOT a boring job, you get to be with animals, it is very fun, you get to be all around the world, you can stay active even after you unload the animals, you get to play games, and it counts as your military service. So if you find your self liking this job than you should enroll.                             ",4,6,0.7728318572044373
8e63734,"""Hi"", I am Luke Bomberger.

I am a Seagoing Cowboy a part of the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" from the UNRRA

( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.)

I was not always a Seagoing Cowboy, I was actually a regular boy just graduating high school and working two part-time jobs one in a grocery store and the other at a bank.

I was doing just fine, until my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat, I couldn't say no, and he said it was an opprotunity of a lifetime so, I said, ""What the heck, I'll go"" and that's the begginning of how my life changed.

It was in August in 1945, when I went on my first adventure as a Seagoing cowboy, I just arrived on August 14, when the Pacific War ended and me and Don got our seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay for us to feed them.

The next day I turned 18 before arriving in Greece and I realized that I could be drafted for military service, so instead I drafted myself and by the time it was 1947, I had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy, I helped many people while stopping, but most inportantly I hope that you can also help people just how me and Don did.

So, in conclusion, just become a Seagoing Cowboy, because it opened the world up to me and gave me a grateful opportunity, and It can make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs.",2,6,0.7056584358215332
8ea0a22,"Hi I'am Luke Bomberger, and way back in 1945 (WW2) my friend ,Don Reist, asked me if I wanted to become a seagoing cowboy and join the UNRRA.( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), the UNRRA is a group of people that resupplied things people had lost after WW2 like food and animals. You might not think it was fun but, boy are you wrong. I had a ton of fun like playing sports and site seeing, and you would too, if you became a seagoing cowboy.

We got to play games after we droped of the animals, there was a ton of room to play many of my favorite games with some of my friends I meet aboard the boat. We played baseball, vollyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, whittling ,and sometimes read. The activites helped pass time in between loads.

Since we traveld in diffrent parts of diffrent contries we could see many site seeing tourist spots. Acropolis, the excavated castle ,many diffrent oceans ,and parts of beauitful contries. We also went on a gondola ride which I thought was weird because we were most of the time on a boat.

Knowing I am helping make a diffrence in many peoples lives was probably the best part of it all. You may see being a seagoing cowboy as loading and unloading boats full of animals, but I am rebuilding contries and lives of many people. Becoming a seagoing cowboy has changed my whole life in an amazing way. Become a seagoing cowboy and understand why I say that.",3,6,0.7779996395111084

I got into this before I turned 18 years old and the best part was they didn't draft me. Now I'm not saying that this is the best job to do. There are some bad things that are with this job. There are some good things with this job too.

One of the good things are you get to go on these amazing adventures when your doing your job. We got to go around the world and see wonderful new things. We went to Greece and boarded the SS Charles and WW Wooster. It was more than just an adventure the whole world opened up to me, I'm grateful for this opportunity.

Lastly, I had time for fun on board, especially on return trips after animals had been unloaded. We would all have fun while playing baseball, volleyball games,table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittiling, and games that would help pass time. So, it wasn't that bad we had fun while working. We got to see new things. I believe that you you need and will change your mind being a Seagoing Cowboy. Are you convinced?",3,6,0.8242558836936951

Luke also toured and excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. And he was doing service to, so you don't have to join the military.

It made him more aware of people from other countries needs. And that awareness can help you if you get lost in a diffrent country.

8f4a4e2,"Luke thought he couldn't give up this opportunity of going to the Europe on a cattle boat. It was only a opportunity of a lifetime but Luke couldn't say no. The story is kind of telling us if there's a only one lifetime opportunity then take it because it could go away and the chances of getting to go is probably in a couple of years or one year. Luke couldn't give it up, it was special to go. Luke wanted to go was because he knew it probably once in awhile and that his mom or dad or family member couldn't afford him to go to the Europe on a cattleboat. Luke instead went with his friend, Don, because it was nice of Don to let him come with him. That was so nice to Don. Not a lot of people is that nice to their friends, in fact a lot of friends are a lot mean to their best friends instead of caring for them. I know this because, "" He knew it was an opportunity of a life time.""

Joining the program is very good news because not a lot of people gets to join the prgram because of A, they have a lot of things to do, or B, they can't afford anything. Luke probably thought it'll be interesting to go join the program they have. Joining the program is like helping out something, maybe helping animals, nature, the Earth, and the environment. To join the program I think it's going to be like doing hard work and helping with a lot of stuff and of coarse helping with other people with their work. Also the thing is that you got to be a hard worker to join the program other wise you probably couldn't get the thing.

Of course the reasons Luke joined in was probably because he wanted to help even though it was kind of challenging but Luke knew he had it in him. I know this because in the text it states, ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" It's like telling us that Luke didn't know this was hard. Luke posibly thought it'll be easy for him to do. But it sucks to have a few cracked ribs and not going back to the job he had. In the text it states, "" Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Also I know, "" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the Untited Nations Relief and Rehabililation Administartion).""

Luke is or maybe a hard worker when it comes to things that includes hard things in a job. Luke knows what to do since it's like his job to do what he was asked to do right. Luke was strong about when he cracked his bones. He gotten more stronger. Luke went back to his job and did it more better. Luke is probably a nice man then anyone else there in the group. Luke deserves much better than this what happened to him on the job he was doing. In the text it states, ""Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy."" Also I know, "" By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke has made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.""

Luke liked being the Seagoing Cowboy and he thought it was an amazing adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the worled for him. He is grateful of the whole thing. In the text it states, "" 'I'm grateful for the opportunity,' he says."" Luke thought it was very aware to other people and thathe could do this whole Seagoing Cowboy thing and be very cool about it. Luke had more fun because it helped the people in other countries in need like he possibly did at first. Luke thought this was awareness stayed with him. I know this because, "" And that awarreness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and echange visitors for many years.

For one, if you are an animal lover you get a chance to help the animals on the cattle boat. As it says in the text, ""On his second trip, Luke seved as a night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour.""

The second reason is that even though you are serving around the world you still get to go sight seeing. In paragraph five it says, "" Luke also toured an exavated castle in Crete and maveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.""

The third reason is that you get to be of sevice around the world to help countries after World War II. In the story it says, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, forty-four nations joined together to form UNRRA (The United Stations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation).""

When I joined the program i was excited to explore and help countries. I was on a trip to Greece and before we arrived I was 18 years old. That means i was old enough to get recruited. My draft board figured out I was on a cattle-boat trip they told me to stay there and keep helping. I was excited to keep doing what I love. I was discharged in 1947. In that time i made nine trips. Thats the most of any seagoing cowboy. I saw many countries like Europe and China. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece. That was special to me. On rides home the crew would play baseball or volleyball on board and many more games. I'm very grateful for this opportunity. It has opened up the world to me!

One reason you should join the seagoing cowboy program is because, you get to vist very nice places. for example if you ever wanted to go to china or any other country? In the program you can do all those things, that but of course you need to play your part in doing your job.

Another suggestion to join the program is because if your one of those caring people who love animals and love nature well the program includes that. In the program you need to take care care of animals mean while you get to your destinaton,And thats quite a bit of time,But thats the main reason why this program was built to help take care of aniamls while they get them to a safer place,Taking care of the aniamls is the main job in this program.

And for my final reason,

I think you should join this program because seeing all the different kind of places you can visit seems like a great opportuinty. You also get to see amazing places of that country/region. For example lets say you go to china you might have a chance of visitng the great wall of china. And in my opinion thats probabley the bst perk of the seagoing program. Along with teammates that might even become your friends.

In my opinion,I think that the seagoing cowboy program is a facisinating program overall. Taking care of animals,visting different countrys,Nice places you can see on the way. This program is probabley one of the best life time opportunitys. This is why i think you should join the seagoing cowboy program.",3,6,0.7804434299468994

But there are some imorpartant things like you get to help other countries with their needs because after World War 2 euroupe was left with great disasters like it`s citys where ruined lots of people died and lots of fammilys lot`s their homes and to help these countries to recover. You woyuld help them with their food supply,and animals,But we weren`t alone 44 other nations joined together to form the (The United States Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and to join the Sea going cow boy you would be doing these countries a huge favor because whaty if we had a Worl War 3

At first he didn't know after High-School graduation everything was going to change working two jobs at the bank and the grocery-store. When his friend asked him to come along he knew It was a chance to have a little fun, and get away from work. It would probably be a good idea to go to the camp because to have something fun to do once in a while.

If you went you would probably go and do lots of things you' ve never done before. Like for example when Luke went to the Acropolis in Greece, taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water. Also he toured a excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal onhis way to China. Maybe you'd want to do something cool like that one day. Plus if your a animal person this should definetly be your thing because the animals would keep you busy sometimes. The animals had to be fed and watered three times a day. Plus Luke also found time to have fun on board (play games) after the animals were unloaded. Games like baseball, volleyball, and boxing It also helped pass the time If you were bored.

This could be a dream in a lifetime for you to go places you've never been and do things you've done It's not just taking care of animals It's also an adventure.",3,6,0.6360207796096802

904cc41,"Would like to go out into the sea and have alot of fun? I think i would! Here are a couple of reasons why, first off you could visit new places. Also you could see new things. Lastly you could get use to the water.

It was in 1945, World war 2 was over in eroupe and many counttries were left in ruins. So what i mean about visting new places is that, you could pretty much go anywhere, well as long as there was water. What i really meant was you can go to china florida all of those nice water filled places. Lastly they are just very nice and a besautiful place to stay.

Now you could see new things. Maybe things you have seen in pictures, or magazines, or something on your mobile device, that you would like to see in real life, like if you go to the china you could see ""The Great Wall of China."" Just those kinds of things makes it exciting to go new places and see new things. So i hope your ready for this next paragragh.

You would have to get used to the water! I know, i know it doesnt sound that bad, until one night you eat some bad shrimp and there is a storm a brewing up in the sky, the boat starts to rock in the wind, then you feel it coming, up, up, and out of your throat comes the vomit, over to the side of the boat you run. Hey i told you, you would have to be prepared for this paragraph, now didnt i warn you. Now back to what i was saying. You would have to get used to the water. There is a lot of things that could go wrong. You throwing up, you sliding off the edge. You would just have to get used to thed currency and record when the waves come by so you know when another one is coming. Like if a wave came at 2:00pm, then another one come at 2:30pm you excpect another one to come at 3:00pm.

Those were all of my reasons why i think you should go be a seagoing cowboy.",3,6,0.5053589344024658

First I went to New Orleans, the crew and I arrived there on August 14th. I got there the day the Pacific war ended. We got our seaman's papers and headed for Greece. We had 335 horses a long with us plus enough hay and oats to feed them! I will tell you what though you get attached to these sweet and loving animals.

I turned 18 before arriving in Greece. Instead getting drafted to the military service I got to keep going on with my cattle-boat trips! You should join because instead of fighting you could be on a ship full of lovable animals! By the time I was discharged I made nine trips! I think I broke a record of the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy!

I hope to see that you have joined this program, just like I have. Think about it you get to be with a bunch of adorable horses. You don't have to go to military services. Going to exotic places is a rare oppertunity...unless you join the Seagoing Cowboys Program! I can not wait to see your dission.                                       ",2,6,0.8018105626106262

If you join the Cattle-boat you could have the time of your life you could see thinges you

never seen before you could go in caslies and see so much stuff I had a great time everyone is nice they all work together and have a good time.

If we get avery thing done we could play some board games. Or when we take the animals where we need to we could play baseball, volleyball, games, table-tennis tourments, fencing, boxing, reading,whittling, and games also help pass the time. You could also hang out with me more. We could see animals we never seen before.

We could go to China and go cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States whole careing animals and having a good time. We could see at night if the animals are ok and have a good time. If one of us are about to fall off the ship one of us could catch one another.

So that is why I think that we could have a good time when we are working and we could have a lot of fun. Made you will come but it is up to you.   ",3,6,0.5576791763305664

It can be a life changing experience because you can visit places,help animals as they travel over sea,and you can have fun while on the job. There are several reasons why people should join but i'll explain the major three.

My first reason why people should join the program is because you can travel to places you'll wont see everday. In the text it states that Luke said the cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy. He also said he had the side benenifit of seeing Europe and China, also he said seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

My second reason why people should join the program is because you can help animals grow,help them stay healthy, and and get them to their destination safely. In the passage it states the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day. The text also states that bales of hay and bags of oats had to pulled up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned. Also the text states that Luke helping out his aunt at her farm as a boy helped prepare for hard work.

My final reason why people should join is because you can have fun to pass time. you can find things to do to keep you entertained. In the text it states that Luke also found time to have fun on board. The text states that the cowboys played baseball and vollyball games. They also had table tennis tournaments and boxing.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboy program can change your life in many ways you can care for animals and go places you will enjoy and have fun at the same time.",3,6,0.8445230722427368

Here are some reasons why youu should sign up. You could help people out by going and helping with the food supplies, horses, cattle, youn cows, mules,and more. It would be doing a good deade too.

Another good reason is it might be a opportunity that you may never get to take again or if you wanted to try it too see if you like it.

If you are 18 though you could be drafted for military service so if u ever wanted to be apart of the military service it would be a good idea to sign up. Another good reason is if you wanted to just go and look at some new places this would be a good idea because they travel a lot and make a lot of trips.

Going on trips like this to places that need help because they just got out of worl war ll can make you see how much more help thses people need then you do. Another really good idea is that if you ever wanted a chance to help out with animals and stuff and never got a chance to this would be a good idea since they help out with all that.

In this essay i was trying to get people to sign up for seagoing cowboys. I hope the reasons i gave you was helpful enough for people to see that it would be a good idea to go and help out all the people that are in need and to help out with the food and animals and stuff.

You also get to go places you never seen before like, in the passage it said that Luke explored Venice, Italy. It is very fun too because, you get to also play fun sports like tennis, volleyball games, and table tennis tournaments. It takes a lot of hardwork to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

He also said that gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Luke also found fun time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys would have so much fun the would play baseball and volleyball in empty holds where animals had been housed.

You can save people and animals. You can save the person if they are drowning by your boat or you can save an animals if they fall of your boat.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. Luke said it opended up the world to him he said he is grateful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs. That aware stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night,after making his hourly report to the captain, he slide down a slippery ladder on his backside.

I think you should join because you can have opportunitues you may never have again, like helping people who were left in ruins revive their towns, food supplies, animals, and you have a extraordinary experience because you get to go places you may have never had the chance to go. It is a great program to be apart of.

One main thing you do in this program is help countries who according to the article in paragraph 2 "" were left in the ruins."" One thing you do is revive their food supply. Some ways we did that are brought them food in the cargo ships we were on. We loaded all sorts of different food on the ship, along with other things they needed an made our way across the Atlantic Ocean. Another thing we coudl do is bring seeds with us to plant over there. This is a big help because then we would have more room for other things they needed just as bad. The seeds would be planted and grown to have fresh fruits and vegetables. We also brought young animals to raise and butcher for meat.

Another way we helped the people and countries who suffered during World War II was bring animals over to replace the ones that were maybe killed when they fought or that were killed for food. Some of the animals we brought were, horses and young cows, and of course the food forthe animals to eat. The cows were brought over for many reasons, one reason was simply to raise and butcher for food. Another reason was so they could help people carry heavy things differnet places. They were big helps. Horses were brought over for transportation and to use to pull big loads. If farmers also wanted to use them for farming reason they could.

While I was in this group I went a lot of places that otherwise I would have never got to go. While we were over seas I got to tour an empty castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal. I also got to see famous landmarks such as the Acropolis in Greece. During our ways to and from we seen Europe and China. I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy a city with streets of water. I got chances that I would have never got if it wasn't for this program.

One last thing that makes me happy that this program exists is that I would have probably never know what it was like to cross an ocean on a boat without this program. I also met new people and seen things that me seeing never crossed my mind. I had fun while I was in this Program. I loved being called a Seagoing Cowboy.

Do you think you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy? Does it sound like something that you want to be apart of?

You and your crew can play baseball and volleyballl games in empty holds where animals have been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, whittiling, games, and even reading can help pass time on your way back.

People might say that if you slip you can fall out if doing midnight rounds. Well, with the technologhy we have today you won't be as likely to slip and fall out of the boat. People might aslo say the that what if people attack you on the boat while sailing. You would be able to protect the animals and you because the U.S. wouldn't send you without any protection. You would most likely have guns or othe ships following you. Also, most likely no one will attack you while you are trying to get animals or help a country.

I belive that other people should join the Seagoing Cowboy programs because you can see historical sights, you can have fun after the animals get off, and a huge thing is that you are helping other countries.",3,6,0.8582952618598938
929161a,"You should be a Seagoing Cowboy. It is very fun and can help others who are in need of animals. You could adventure during your free time and it is so amazing.

You can explore places like the Acropolis in Greece. During free time we play table tennis, we fence, and we have boxing matches. We also play volleyball and read. You can feed animals like horses. Even though it is hard work it is still very fun and you should try it. You can help on farms. It is fun to water the animals to keep them clean and to feed them so they do not go hungry. You can excavate a castle or take a gondola ride. Hard work can be fun if this is your job. There are plenty of horses and food for them in the ship.

You can make plenty of trips, but they might be long. It is fun sailing across oceans seeing the fish and the water as long as you do not mind getting sea sick or homesick. Some trips can take two whole weeks. Some can even take a month. It can be dangerous if you do not be careful. You could even get cracked ribs.

In conclusion, I think you should consider being a Seagoing Cowboy because, it is fun and you can help others.",2,6,0.8051540851593018

One reason you should come with us in the seagoing cowboys program is that we venture to cool and foriegn places like china and i got to see the Panama Canal,all and all it's just a realy good experience and you would like it if you are an outgoing person.

Another reason you should come with us is because the animals they are realy cute and fun to be around all tho they do take some care its nothing compared to having an adorible animal to keep you company when you are alone.

The last reason in my opinion is you get to be out in the ocean and who doesn't love that and it just gives you time to explore and have fun with everything the animals the ocean the adventure and the quitness of just hereing the waves and having a great time.

And that is why i think you should come aboard with us because all and all you would just have a great time.",2,6,0.8231098651885986

Being a sea cowboy isn't alway easy, but it's worth all the hardwork and effort. It's a great job for any hardworkers and is fun for anyone who decides to join the Seagoing Cowboy program. No one will regret joining the program.

Those who like to sail this is a great job. It will be a couple weeks on the water to sail and experience the waters of many oceans and seas. One trip is to China and takes two weeks. That is a great time to enjoy sailing. When not working, on the way back, all sea cowboys can play volleyball, baseball, and other games too. It's not always work so they can have freetime during their travels.

Not only is it great for sailors, but it's also good for animal people. People who like to work with animals or just take care of animals have a great oppourtunity too. One of the animal jobs is a night watchman. They checkup on all the animals once every hour during the night. That means it's not just all work. There are other animal jobs too, like feeding the animals and giving them water. There are great things for animal workers with the Seagoing Cowboy program.

With the sailors and animal caretakers there are oppourtunities to see the world. The sea cowboys travel to many places to ship animals. When they get to the place where they are shipping to, cowboys can see the places and explore forein lands. Not only do they get to see other places, they also get to see the waters of many places and may see lands off in the distance.

There are many great oppourtunities for everyone! Seeing the world is fun, even if someone has to work during it.

Caring for animals is great for people who have or like animals. If a cowboy just wants to sail they can man the ship. Being part of the Seagoing Cowboys program is amazing for anyone. Being a part of this program is a great way to have fun and earn money at the same time. Come be a sea cowboy to help many nations in need.

92eeb85,"""The Cowboy Program""

This isn't just any type of cowboy program, this is a cowboy who rode the waves. I think it would be good for kids to come helpout at this program. It can make you smart and learn about things you might not know.

This boy named Luke went with his best friend. His life totally changed. I'm now going to tell you why you should come. What they did their was they helped people. The boy boys played fun games like, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. They did that to help pass time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much of an adventure. Now here are some places they went that I think you might like. It took the group two weeks to travel across the Alantic ocean. They went to China which took a month. Also the program went to Greece to get their Military service. For World War ll in 1945, they went to Europe.

Now I'm going to tell you things they did to help out that you might like to do, if you like to do chores. Luke served as a night watchman. Also he went and checked on the animals every hour. Also to keep Luke busy about the animals is they had to be fed or watered two or three times a day. Another thing is bales of hay and bag of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. The stalls also had to be cleaned.

Lastly I'm going to tell you why Luke went on this ship and why you might want to. Luke went on this trip because he wanted to help out is best friend. Also he knew it was possibly the only chance he would ever get to get to go. Another reason is Luke thought it might be good work him. I think he also went on this trip to help out 44 other countries to recover their items. This was a very important job and Luke did a good job. I bet if you tried this, you would too.

Do you think you would ever want to go on this trip? I would, it sounds like you have to do work, but you still can have a lot of fun with the trip. I think it is also important to help out with other things. Maybe some day you should try this some day if you ever get the opportunity.         ",3,6,0.8072146773338318

Going to places and doing things like the seagoing cowboy program will bost up your confidence to try more things. In the story he was ready to go try out at the seagoing cowboy program. I think that that would be a good thing for every one to do.

In the story it says that he is old enough to go to military service. That shows that the trip made him think that he could be in the military. The text says""Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service.""If you try out for this the seaging cowboy program it might make you think of doing military school. Or try even better things. The text says ""It opend up the world to him.""

If you still dont think that you are ready to go here than here are a few things that i pulled out of the text that is telling you what this program is about. It says that they are hireing people to take care of animals. The text says""UNRRA hired 'Seagoing coyboys' Totake care of the hores,young cow,and mules that were shiped over seas.""The text also says""To help these countries recover their supplies,animlas,and more,44 nations joined together to form UNRRA.""Since the UNRRA is going to be hiring you to work with the you might be able to become a UNRRA and help people get there things back.

This event will be so fun and exciting because you get to do all kinds of fun and cool things. Like I was saying it will help you do more things in life. The text says ""It opend up the world to him.''The text also says ""I'm grateful for the opportunity.""That shows that this event made him want to do more. Like it says it opend up the world to him,If he would have not went to this event than he would have not have done so mary great things.

So like I have been saying it will be such a great thing to go to this event. I bet that so many people have went there and have got more open to the world. If you go there you never know you might just make this world a better place. So when you get a second just think about how you can go there and make the world a better place.

Do you want an adventure? Maybe you should try something called seagoing. Seagoing would be a fun and educational trip where you get to help others, and make a diffrence in the world. The following reasons are why you should try seagoing.

In the text in paragraph number two it states that, ""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left to ruins."" From this piece of infomaion you can tell that people in Europe are facing hard times and that is why it is important to help those people. Furthermore, in paragraph number, eight it talks about how the cowboys also found time to have some fun. For instance in the text it says, ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table- tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.""

From this sentance you can tell the cowboys did not only work but had fun as well. Not only this but in paragraph number five it talks about the sights of Europe and China. For example in the text it states that,"" Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

Also in the last paragraph it talks about how great the learning experince was. I know this because in the text it states that, ""It opened up the world to him. I'm grateful for the opportunity, he say's. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" For this piece of evidene I can infer that the trip was not just to see the sights and have fun but to get a learning exerince out of the trip. Many people may disagree with me and argue that the trip is not necessary. Why?

Well many people would say this trip is dangerous. For instance in the article, paragraph number seven it states that,""He slid down a slippery ladder on his backside."" This piece of information could be why people think this trip is to dangerous.

From the previous examples I think that is why you should go this trip. Rember this trip is not for realaxing, but for a learning, and hard working, once in a lifetime experince. Also rember that you can still have fun while working. ",3,6,0.7603867053985596

One reason you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program is is because you can go all over the world. Luke stated that he saw Venice, Italy. He also said he saw Acropolis in Greece. Luke also stated that he saw an exavated castle in Crete and the marveled Panama Canal on his way to China. Those are only some of the places you can go when you join the program.

Another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program is because you can learn how to take care of animals. For example, you would have to take animals like horses, young cows, and mules. Luke had to feed horses oats and hay. They had to keep stalls clean. The animals had to be fed two or three times a day. Those are only some of the ways you had to take care of the animals.

The final reason you should join the program is because you can still have time to have fun. The text states that Luke had a especially fun time on thier return after the animals have been unloaded. They would play baseball and volleyball games. They would fence and box. They would read and whittle. Most of all, they would have table tennis tournaments. These are ways you can have fun on the trips.

To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals and more, 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA. UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for many reasons.

One reason to join is that the Seagoing Cowboys can help you learn responsibility. As mentioned in paragragh six it states, the animals had to be fed two to three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. This shows that it takes responsibility because you have to make sure you feed and clean the animal's pens regularly so they won't get sick or die.

The second reason you should join the Seaging Cowboys is because it will let you have an opportunity that you might have never gotten. As mentioned in paragraph five it states, ""Besides helping people, Luke had the side benefit of seeing Greece and China."" This shows that you can see and do things you might have never done before.

As some claim, the trip is very long and dangerous. Yes, this may be true, however table-tennis tournaments fencing, boxing, rading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

We thinks you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys. Some reasons why we think you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys is that besides taking care of and bringing ruined coutries animals. You can visit and seeing new places such as Europe and China.

Before you can visit those wonderful places, you have to take care of the animals. You have to make sure their stalls were clean, and that they had been fed and watered two or three times a day. You also have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship you are traveling in.

There is also fun to be found on the ship. Once you have unloaded all the animals, you could play baseball or even volleyball in the empty animal holds. To pass the time people would do table-tennis tournaments. They would also do fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling to also pass the time.

A job that you might have to do is night watchman. During the night, the only thing you have to do is that you would have to check on the animals every hour.

People should join this force because it's fun not only fun it helps you explore the world, like New Orleans, Greece , Venice, and even China. I'm sure there is many more places Luke visited and just didn't talk about.

Boeing a seagoing cowboy isn't always about fun and games. Sure that's one thing but it's also a duty. It's a duty to get you're animals from one country to another, or farmers wouldn't have cattle, butchers wouldn't have cows,etc. but without them some countries wouldn't have cows, mules, and horses. Even know it's a duty seagoing cows are always helping in they're own way. They get animals from one place to another but they are also kind. I'm sure if someone was having a bad day and to pick up a horse, the seagoing Cowboys were there to help.

To begin with,you have to be very brave to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

To become a Seagoing Cowboy you can't be scared of water or being on a boat for a long time. One day when Luke was on night watchman it was very rainy.

When he was going to make his hourly report to his captin he fell on a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs.

Next, is what jobs you do to become a Seagoing Cowboy. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have help a lot of people and animals.

On the way across the Atlantic Ocean, Luke's boat picked up some animals. Luke was incharge of feeding them and give them water 2 to 3 times a day. Also he had to clean up after the animals.

Last, is how long you have to be on the ship and what fun you can have.

When Luke had to cross the Atlantic Ocean it took his ship 2 weeks to get across. After the animals got unloaded, the other Seagoing Cowboys got to have some fun. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed.

The reasons to join are that you get free time to do whatever you want,and also you get to have responsibilites. some responsibilites are that you work with animals and when you do you have to clean them,feed them,and clean their stalls etc. if you like working with animals,don't get sea sick,and aren't careless this could also be the job for you.

Growing up said he had two jobs so that mae it perfect for it beacause he ahd the expirence of working hard. He also helping his Aunt Kate's farm helped him get used to working hard for something. Luke and his friend Don was planing on doing this together. Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat, before he probaly wouldnt even had done it. Luke literaly almost died because he almost fell off board. Maybe if Don didnt tell him maybe he wouldnt never almost died on the cattle ship.

Luke said it was an adventure , it opened up a new world for him, he said ,"" I am grateful for his opportinity,"" he says,"" It made we aware of other people of other coutries and thier needs."" he said he was grateful for it he didnt think of it as just doing it because you have to he wanted to do, he saiid once in a lifetime oppuntity, he wanted to he wasn't pushed his choice.

I think more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it's a chance to experience new things, see unique places, and meet many new people. Being in the Seagoing Cowboys program could open up your eyes to new and exciting things. It's a great opportunity to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being part of the Seagoing Cowboys, you can have lots of fun. You can find unique ways to spend your time, because the Seagoing Cowboys have to go on some pretty long trips. But, you can also go sight-seeing, and see wonderful things. You can also get a chance to help out people who really need it, and it feels great to give to other people. It opened up the world for some people. It makes you more aware of people of other countries and their needs. There will be lots of other people on board too, so you can also get a chance to socialize with them, and become great friends. When you can find time to have fun on board, you can play games such as baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. You can even have a table-tennis tournament, and many more other types of games. It's sure to make it feel like time is going by quicker.

It's not all fun and games, though. You also will have to care for the animals. You must make sure you feed and water them two or three times a day. You need to make sure that you will also have enough food and water for the animals, and the people on board. You have to make sure the animals' stalls are clean, too. But, doing this can also keep you busy, and if you like to care for animals, then this could also be very fun. You will have to try and stay safe too, and make sure other people on board are safe, as well. Just try not to fall off the cattle boat. It's not that hard. You will have to be extra careful if you have to serve as a night watchman. You will have to check on all the animals every hour and report to the captain.

While you travel the sea, you can get a chance to go touring in the places. You can get a chance to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, which is a city with streets of water. You can tour an excavated castle in Crete, and maybe pass by the Panama Canal. There's a lot of opportunities to see many cool and unique things as part of the Seagoing Cowboys. It's a trip you're sure to never ever forget.

These are all my reasons of why I believe more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it. Being a part of the Seagoing Cowboys, is much more than just an adventure.",5,6,0.8240177631378174

Firstly, participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program would give you the chance to help out. Many countries were left in ruins after World War 2, this program helps though. The Seagoing Cowboys program hires ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals. What better way could you help out.

Participating gives out huge amounts of help that is put to good use.

Second of all, there are lots of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke Bomberger explains, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy."" Luke, like many others, got plenty of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke went from Europe to China to Greece and even Venice, there are so many places to visit, joining would be the best way to see them.

To add to that, participating would open up a great world of awareness. Joining helps bring about an awareness to people of other countries and their needs. Joining would not only be an amazing adventure, it would help with seeing other peoples point of views and how they need help.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is helpful and fun all in one, and would be the best choice to make. It may have it's downsides, but the good parts in joning, (helping out, sight-seeing, and awareness) make up for any and all bad parts.",3,6,0.8722624778747559

In one of Luke's trips there had been more then 335 plus enough hay to feed all of them. By time Luke had turned 18 he had arrived in Greece which meant he could go into the military service. When Luke had been discharged he had maken more then nine trips, that is the most any Seagoing Cowboy has ever gone in this service. It took the Seagoing Cowboys two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the United States, and on top of it took them a month to get to China.

When Luke was younger he used to help out on his Aunt Katie's farm, this helped him to learn his hardworking skills but never trained him for the dangers at sea. He had decided that helping out in the Seagoing Cowboys and all of the animals, and food services was worth all the help that him and his pals had given. It was real rainy one night after making his hourly check up on the horses to report to the captain when he had slipped down a slippery ladder ship cracking some of his ribs so then he couldn't do his job for a couple of days.

Luke also had a lot of fun on board with all of his friends. When the animals had been unloaded they played baseball, volleyball, fencing, table tennis and a lot more sports and game. Luke said that being a Seagoing Cowboy was way much more then an adventure he had opened up the world for Luke. He was very grateful for his jouney, it mad him more aware of the other countries and there needs.

Luke had learned everything from helping out animals to teamwork. Luke thought seen that helping other countries is fun but you do have to learn teamwork and much more.

Introduction

People all over the world should go to the Seagoing Cowboys Program because of how fun it is and they could found out so much about the wolrd. Some people ask how would that be fun, it would be fun because some people can't always go and see new place in the world that they have never seen and I say from the article Luke Bomberger was so excited to see new things like he went to China and he loved it he went to Venice, Italy and he loved it. My another reason was because all the stuff you could found out like is the great wall of china really great and does Italy food really good.

So now you guys can really see how fun and amazing it is to be a Seagoing cowboy. I will give you 2 reason you should go, then I will explain them. First reason is because it is fun, Second reason is all the stuff you can figure out. Details about the first reason it is fun because all the cool stuff you can see. So one cool thing you can see is thegreat wall of China then is Italy food really good you can learn new stuff like new laugaues and bring back cool stuff and like is the great wall of China really great and like what the queen of Englad really look like. So now the second reason is all the cool stuff you could find out like how war zone really like after a war. What city you want to be saving up for. So now all of this brings me to my conclusion.

Conclusion

Be a seagoing cowboy could be fun and cool but its all about what you learn and doing the job that needs to be done so basically make sure you get those horse and young cattle and mules to the place they to be. if a friend offer you to go to another coutry or state go with them you will be amazed about what you would found Luke found a job that let him travel all over the world and that is that job any body could have.",2,6,0.753734827041626

I know all this because the text says. But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""i'm grateful for the oppurtunity he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their need's.

Another reason is the text says. It took about two weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states. And a month to get to china. It also says Besides helping people. I had the benifet of seeing europe.

The text also says But seeing Acropolis in greece was special he says. It also says Luke turned 18 before ariving in greece. It also says so was taking a gondola ride in venice italy. A city with streets of water those are a few of the things to do. And it also states To help these countries recover their food suplies animals and more 44 nation's joined together.

That is why people should join the seagoing cowboy's program. You get to help people in the darkest times. Like after war when they have almost no food.

It is a very busy job and you get tired a loy. Sometimes you have to watch the animals every hour to make sure they're safe. You wouldn't want them to escape and get hurt!

Helping all of those animals can really open up your mind and see how much some animals are suffering. It is great that there are programs like this that can help so many animals. It is a great adventure to go on and it is very fun! If you get bored on the boat you can go play some games like we did like volleyball or table tennis or anything you can think of!

Luke joined the seagoing cowboys after he graduated highschool. While Luke was on the ship his job was to clean up the spaces which had the animals in it. Sometimes his job was to check the animals every hour. Luke says that ""it was the opportunity to see or do different things. Besides helping people.""

when the ship arrived at different places Luke would explore the areas and go try different things. For example, he went on a gondola ride in Venice. Another example is he toured in a excavated castlein crete. My final example is that Luke marveled at the Panama canal. Luke also saw Acropolis and China.

Luke also found time to have laughs on the ship. The crew members and Luke after cleaning the hold would do sports. Such as, baseball and volleyball games. The would also do table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading , writing, and whittling. They also did boardgames.

After you did about 9 and below of trips. You see the world. It can also show you that other people in different countries need your help. Whether it's clean clothes,food,or shelter there is always a way you can help. These reasons show that living on a boat isn't so bad.",2,6,0.6376206874847412

First reason you get to help others. Plus you get to see if there are different ways to help us recover faster, so we can have other workers to help out. Last of the first reason leads to the second you can explore the world.

Second reason as I said you get to explore the world while doing this. I bet you are wondering how? Well we don't need you to stress out, so we let explores for a little while and then get the next shipment.

The last reason is because you get to relax after your shipment of horses and play around with some new friends and laugh and joke around. Luke says on his way back he got to play some baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the horse use to be. They also had Table-tennis tourneys, fencing, and boxing. If you were not into sports you could whittling and play some games on the floor to pass some time.

Another reason is so he can help the people that was hungry and their houses got damaged during the war. Also to take care of the aminals that they hade to transport by boat.

When Luke and his friend herd about what happened durin World War two they want to heip those countries that where ruine. So him and his friend Don signed up to be Seagoing Cowboy. Also in 1945 Luck and his friend Don received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 12 the day the Pacific war ended. They also got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W.Wooster.

The same day Don and Luke got their seaman's papers they got on a boat and headed yo Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy he ""says. When Luke was feeding the animals or something he almost fell over board but it was a good thing a piece of metle saved him. Luke wouldn't be able to do anything for a while because he has some broken ribs.

Conclusion: Even when u get hurt never give up on something u want to do or what your doing. Also it is good to help others if they need it or when they are hurt thats when they need you the most. Just like Luck and his friend Don they both went all the was to New Orleans to help others. They didn't think about themselves they thought about other people and there lives.

Or it could be dead bodies floating in the ocean which might smell bad and make you sick to your stomach. Also feading farm life That will make you STINKY and smell bad. Also where does the ""waste"" goanyway do they throw it off the edge of the ship? or leave it there?

I would not want to live there for two weeks it would be smelly nasty gross and disgusting.

The ride would be long also I would be very homesick i would miss my family my friends and pets. Also what happens if you crash you you float out to see or get rescued or drown or live on to tell the tale? What would happen to the animals? would THEY drown or THEY float away or They survive or you could get eaten by sharks!

Or get impaled by a storms debrie or get very very SICK! or even worse someone kills you. Now I wouldnt want to be on THAT boat.

For my second to final papagraph I would 1 Not want to get sick. 2 I would not wanna get killed. 3 I would not want to get impaled by debrie. 5 I would not want to get eaten alive. 6 I would not want to see sick or dead poeple on my trip 7 I would not want to crash and get stranded 8 I would not like o drown 9 I would miss my family friends and pets. 10 I would not like to eat rotten or smelly food or drinks.

What would happen if you have to eat the animals then no more food for the poeple who need it and it would be cruel and you cant drink plain ocean water it needs to be distilled and run out of water faster. And if you fall over board you could get left behind or get saved and live to tell the tale or get thrown overboard or get eaten by animals or if the animals die then they get thrown over board and it would be wierd and gross seing animals being pulled along by the current.

So in conclusion I would not want to join the ""Sea Cowboys""

I joined the program for many reasons. I joined because I have a really good friend named Don Reist. He talked to me about how they do things there and how much fun it is. So I thought, if I went and was serving people and helping them survive, would it be good for me, and then I knew that God was calling me to do this and I wanted to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, so I said, ""Yes.""

Once I got there, I heard that there were 44 nations and that we were going to form UNRRA, wich meant, (the United Nations Relief nd Rehabilation Administration).

The Seagoing Cowboys is a program for cowboys that ride the waves caring for animals.

They care for animals that live on a land that just got destroyed.

There are a bunch of stories about their history.

They have been on the most dangerous assignments.

First of all, there is a reason that you should join.

That reason is to save a lot of animals.

Another reason that you should join this program is that this is right after World War 2, so animals need foof and water.

There is an organization called the

UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and there is only so much that group can do.

On the other hand, about this Seagoing Cowboys program, you can go anywhere in the world like Europe or China.

You have to make sure that you have enough supplies on the boat to care for the animals.

LIke if u have horses, then you would have hay and oats.

You can also take as many animals as your ship can hold.

One of the boats had 335 horse and still had enough hay and oats to feed them.

For the record, one more reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to go site seeing when ever you want.

You could go see a national landmark while you are on the job.

I remember this one person that was a Seagoing Cowboy, he went to Greece.

The toughest part of this job was going over a bunch of water and getting the animals back to where they belonged.

It would be so cool to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

To sum up my findings, I thought that this passage was a great example o fa job to do if you love animals.

I hope people consider this job.

For th future, do whta you think is right and never give up if you wnat to go sme where.

You should always follow your dreams even if you don't want to, cause one day that dream might come true.   ",3,6,0.873542308807373

Well, yes, it can be very dangerous sometiem, but you have to take the risk.

You only live once you know.

Like I almost died one night while going down a ladder.

I slipped and was going straihgt for the opening side of the ship.

Then a piece of metal stopped me and I didn't plunge into the Atlantic after all.

Even though I was alive I cracked a rib and has to sit out for a while.

The text states,"" One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captin, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside.""

The text also states,"" A small strip of etal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.""

You should also really join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to go to so many beautiful places and explore.

It really is a beautiful sight in some places.

Like I remeber taking a tour while on my way to China.

I also saw the Acropolis in Greece it was special.

The text states,"" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

The text also states,"" Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.""

I loved being a Seagoing Cowboy it was special and I really think you should join becuase you get to see places, help people, meet people, and more.

It was not just a adventure it also opened up the world for me.

The text states,"" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

It opened up the world to him.

The text also states,"" I'm grateful for the opportunity.

It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""       ",3,6,0.7920642495155334

When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to take care on not just animals, but also people in need. As I said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China,"" I said. Also in Venice,Italy it was ""A city with streets of water."" As you travel to theese far away places you also haft to take care of animals along the way.

Caring for theese animals willl sure keep you busy, but it is quite easy all you do is feed them, water them, and clean stalls. This experience is also good with connecting with people on the ship. I had fun on board with games such as baseball,volleyball,tabel-tennis,fenncing,boxing,reading,and other games past the time. With this journey it made me aware of people of countries and there needs. So join not only the Seagoing Cowboys for helping people, but also the exsperience.

Even though on the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see cities and have fun, but it is also a tremendus amount of work. As you said taking animals is actually hard dependig on what animal. You need to clean,feed,and give water to animals every single day. Sure you have breaks but it is still a lot of work for one person. Not to metion this exsperince is on a boat. Most people either have sea sickness on boats as well you have a extreme chance of crashing,sinking,drowning,and also falling off board into endless ocean.

While travilling all over the word you haft to deal with climate and time change. It will take some getting use to constantly changing weather and sleep schedules. Also its very hard to even sleep on a boat with sailing on dangerous waters in the dark every night. While caring for people is a great deed to do it is aslo hard watching people suffer everyday even though your helping them you can still think of other people in that situation as well.

You get on a boat and sail and you get to see serval places , like China , Greece , and Eroupe . Those three are just a few places you get to see and they are absoultly amazing . You get to see animals and take care of them for a long while . Of coruse you have some chores and have to clean up after them but it's not really a big deal especially if your a animal lover . An yes it is very dangreous kinda because you are in the military but wouldn't you risk it to save others . To be brave , and save a life . I don't know about you but that is a very mobil act .

The cons of being a part of Seagoing Cowboys Program is you have to work very hard , you have to do your part . Anthother thing if you get seasick it would be extra challenging , because your on a boat for serval mothes and weeks at a time . An like luke you could very easly slip and fall and break you ribs . I mean he could of died . It's very dangoues espeically if it rains , because that doesn't help , an the water is very cold so hope you don't fall in .

To be in the militalry , you have to be very courages and very brave . If you think about it it's really worth it because you are saving lives and thats why most people do it , to help people and to save lives . I think personally that it's worth it I would love to save someones life and do a very courages deed like that , it takes guts . Also I'm a animal lover so that would be amazing .

that you wanted to do. So you put it aside for next year becuase you wanted to hang out with your friends or faimly. Some people wanted to do things like programs or groups but couldn't becuase they have ""other things"" to do that aren't that really important. So this paper should make you think twice about going or signing up for the UNRRA program.

My first reason to join the UNRRA program is becuase you get to help other people in other countries that are in need for help or care. The UNRRA helpes people from Europe to China and give them stuff like food, water, and other things becuase of the war that happened in Europe which we call World War 2.

My second reason why you should join the UNRRA program is becuase that you get to see other countries or cities that aren't pausible to travel on foot, car, or train. You can get to see other counties like China, Greece, Crete, and even Panama Canal for a matter of fact.

My last reason to why you should join the UNRRA program is that there's fun activeities on the UNRRA ship to do. There's vollyball, boxing, table-tennis tornaments, fencing, baseball, whistleing, reading, and other sports or relaxing things to do before we go back to get more supplies for the people in Europe and people in other countries.

I hope this paper made you think twice about signing up or joining the UNSSA program. I'll also hope you'll join the UNRRA program sooner or later to help out others in Europe and people from other countries to make them feel safe, cared for, and happy.",3,6,0.4412000775337219

Some reasons you might want to join is being able to know you did something good by helping out those in need. By shiping food to people who are starving and giving them materials to build them shelters could really help out many people.

Not only knowing that you did good in someone's life is not all though, on the boat, you can go places and see places that you may not be able to see. Taking care of the animals can be fun, too. You can play with them and have some fun.

You can have some really interesting oppertunities too while your on the boat if you join the Seagoing Cowboys. You can see some amazing places and objects you may never see if you weren't on the boat with the them. Learn something new everyday while your on this boat! In paragraph 9, Luke said, ""I'm grateful for the oppertunity."" Also in paragraph 5, Luke said, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Not all of the Seagoing Cowboys is all work though. During return trips you can have a lot of fun. I paragraph 8, Luke said that the cowboys play volleyball and baseball games in the empty holds where the animals were kept. Table-tennis, fencing tournaments, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games also pass time while returing home.

If you like working with animals, then this might be a job for you. When I was working for the Seagoing Cowboys program, I got to work as a watchman. When you are a watchman you have to check on the animals every hour. That was an amazing experience, trust me.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't all work all the time. You can find time to have fun like I did. I got to play exciting vollyball and baseball games. Along with that, I had time to read, box, fence, whittle, and play in table-tennis tounaments.

To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke could help people because it was World War II in Europe and many countries were left in ruins so he had to help recover their food supplies, animals, and more.

One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship.

There is just not enough people out there that are joining this organization and we need all the people that we can get. All of us people put together into a group that cared and did everything for everyone that they could would turn us all into heros.

UNRRA, stands for the, ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), UNRRA hires people called, ""Seagoing Cowboys"". Seagoing cowboys are people who go on cattle-boat trips to usually far away places. These cattle-boats carry things such as, cows, horses, and other farm animals. Sometimes these boats also carry medical stuff so that the people that go to the other side have stuff that they can help to cure the wounded with. For example during the, Pacific war, seagoing cowboy's were sent over seas to go and be carers for the men and women in which were wounded in battle.

Imagine all the people that are out there fighting for your country while you enjoy the peace in your nice quiet humble home while the people that are out there get to sleep on the ground if they even get to sleep. What if the people that are fighting for you run out of food what if they run out of horses to carry them across the battlefields so if in a case where they almost die they might very well be able to get away with quick speed. Without these items delivered where would we be right now would there be any peace still on earth would we lose the race and get our lives taken from us people that we don't even know?

The courage that these people have the people that fight the fight and the people that help the people that fight the fight fight the fight. You could help with that and it would just be in one easy step and you have to take that step with your help and your time did you know that you could save somebodys life or if anything you could save one hundred peoples lives or maybe even more. To many people you would be a hero. To some you would be a savior.

You I bet would want to be that person it is fun caring kind and heroetic and you might even get extra time. There is some hard work that gets put into it as well but still think of all the lives that you would save all the people that would love you forever. All the things that you could do for your country and it would all be done in just one easy step into the doors of, UNRRA! You can do it you have it in you.        ",4,6,0.6651929616928101

You can save peoples lives. In some countries they don't have the food we do. The least we can do is help them get a boost. And some countries need animals so they can have food or transportation.

You may think that you could be away from your family and it's a waste of time but think of it this way, there are other families out there just like you, hungry starving. Or could already be dead,lets not let that happen to any more families.

This is a one in a life time opportunity. You can save alot of lives from hunger. Afterwards once the animals are all unloaded you can have some fun. You can play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,games will make things seem quicker. You can also have a good feeling in your heart for helping others. Think about others, care about others.         ",3,6,0.7776756286621094

9d4e9b4,"""A cowboy who rode the waves"" is a story where there is so much going on with so many people.

The main character in the story is ""Luke Bomberger"" he works two part-time jobs one at the Grocery Store and the other at the Bank. He has a friend named Don

Reist whom asked Luke to go to Europe with him. They would be riding on a cattle boat with 335 horses only. The reason they had to ride on a cattle boat was because World War 2 just ended and most people animals and buildings got destroyed. They were shipping animals over to Europe so that they could have their animals back. He just turned 18 before they left so he was old enough to help out. Since they had all of the horses he helped out with taking care of them they each had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. He was really good at taking care of all the horses because he used to help out on his aunt's farm with all of the animals. He had trouble sometimes when the storms would be super bad and it would make the boat rock with the bad waves. One time he was going to report back to the captin with the news on how the animals were doing because he was on nightwatch and he slipped and fell off of his ladder. When the boat started tilting he went slididng down the deck of the boat and amost went off board. He didn't go off board luckily because a metal bar stopped him from going two far but he did suffer from broken ribs and have to take some time off. On the trips back to go get more animals the people he was with would play games with him and they also got to see amazing sights on their way there and back sometimes even on the way there is they weren't too busy.

Most of the time this is what happens but his story is really interesting. Most people think it is a horrible idea to do this but I think it's a great one because you get to help people. It is nice to do something like that because most people are less fortunet and things that happened in Europe can happen to them and maybe even you when you don't ever expect it.",2,6,0.6754839420318604

World War 2 was over in the Europe,and many countrys were ruin. To help recover everything 44 Nations joined together to form UNRRA. The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys for they can take care of the horses,young cow,and mules were shipped oversea.

In August 1945, they had received their orders repoets from New Orleans. They had arrived on August 14 that's the day the Pacific war ended. Don and Lke boarded the ship the SS Charles W. Wooster, and then they headed to Greece. THe SS Charles also had a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oat so they can eat.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece.

It took about two weeks to criss the Atlantic Ocean from the east coast of the united states and the a month to get to china. Luke was really busy because caring for the animals during them crossing the ocean. Also he had to fed them and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bages of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. And then he had to clen the Stalls.

On his second trip Luke had to served his night as a watchman. His job was to check on the animal every hour. On this one rainy night after making his hourly report to the captain he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart was racing as he shot first toward an opening ont he side of the ship . A small strip of metal along the edged stopped his slid keeping him from flying forward overboard in the dark Atlantic. But he couldn't work for a couple of day because of his cracked ribs.

Luke also had fun on his trip because when the unloaded the animals the cowboys played basketball and volleyball. Also they played table-tennis tournament, fencing, and boxing.

It would also be a good family trip or good friends trip, if you went with one of them.

Many people are instrested in history so it would be a good trip full of amuzed things. You also could probally visit the history building, were special events took place. People would even ask you to try or do something and that would also be a lifetime event that you always wanted to do. Most people don't like doing this stuff because it 'takes to long to get there' or something, but like i keep saying, it's a lifetime event that you would want to take because maybe you will never be able to do it again, but you can atleast tell people you have been there. While you are there enjoying them places, take pictures so you will always remember that moment, they say if you take a picture it will last longer.

I also traveled across the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States. Now who wouldn't want to see the world like I did and still help people in need?

Next, site seeing. On my journey to help, I got to take a gondola ( a boat) ride in Venice, Italy a city with sreets of water. Wouldn't it be amazing to go on a gondola and to go explore Italy? Also,I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Is'nt that just amazing?

My next reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam is because it helps you be more aware of people in other countries and their needs. Im very grateul that I had the opportunity to participate in this program. It relly opened up the world to me. I learned that people in other countries need help during times of war.

For example , A war is going on and they need medical or food help than you can go over and help those people in need of those things.

If your going to travel by ship Luke found the time to have some fun on board so maybe you can too.

The ship will feed you and give you a bed to sleep-in.

Luke said``It made me more aware of people of other contries and thier needs``.There are lots of reasons to be a part of this program.

Also you have jobs on the ship like cleaning up the ship or getting the food ready for the other people on board to eat. Also on the ship you may run into a storm so the crew will determan how bad the storm is , and if the storm is to bad you will have to go inside till the storm clears.

Then when you arive in the country that is in need you do what they need like getting a water suply or getting food for the people or getting the medical care the people need need and if you dont believe me than just ask Luke.

Then when you are don with what that contry needs then you can get back in/on the ship or waggon you came on than you can leave and return home and wait for the next country that needs.

You should join Seagoing Cowboys Program because you can go to different and unique places around the world. Plus I also went to Europe and China to bring food and water for the animals.

To begin, I went to Greece to help bring food and water for the animals. I had a cargo of 335 horses plus the hay an oats to feed them. Knowing that the the Military might draft me they said "" When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""

Also, I went to China to feed the aninimals. It took a whole month to get to China. Then he says"" The cattle boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small town boy.""

The cows had to be fed three time and watered two times a day.

In conclusion, these are some of the reasons why people should sign up for Seagoing Cowboys.

Do you like helping people?

Well what im about to tell you will make you to sign up right now.

Before I started I had two part-time jobs at a grocery store and a bank.

Without my friend Don Reist i would have never found out about the Seagoing Cowboys.

He invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

I didn't say no I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe and many nations were destroyed.

To help these countries recover their food supplies, anaimals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration).

UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Don and I signed up.

In August 1945, we received orders to report to New Orleans.

We arrived August 14, the day the Pacific war ended.

we boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed to Greece.

I was 18 when we headed for Greece.

It took us about two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

During that time we had enough time to go sightseeing at a lot of places.

But on the ship you do have to take care of the animals.

And what I loved most about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you got to explore the world and help people who need it.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more then an adventure for me.

It opened up the world to me Im grateful for the opportunity.

It made me aware of people of other countries and their needs.

One day my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe with him and of course I didn't say no because I knew this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. So I went with him and that same year 1944 I decided along with my friend to sign up to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Being a Seagoing Cowboy consists of going overseas while taking care of horses, young cows, and mules.

This job may not sound very fun but let me tell you it is. For example, when I turned 18 we were sent to aboard the SS Charles W.Wooster with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. This might seem like a lot but trust me seeing the Acropolis in Greece was something special. I also had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. These were some of the most fun and extroardinary part of our trips.

There were some fun parts but also dangerous parts. One time while it was raining it was my turn to check on the animals and make sure they were safe but I slipped and almost flew off board. The good thing was that a strip of metal caught me. I was relieved to still be alive but I couldn't work for a couple of days because I had some cracked ribs.

Even though I had to work hard and do some risking stuff. I had a great time. It was quite an adventure that I wouldn't change for anything. Just think you could have an amazing experience like me or maybe even better, but what is certain is that you will have quite an extroadinary adventure.          ",3,6,0.7673473954200745

This is a hard job, cleaning out animal stalls, feeding animals, and being the watchman are a few things you will do. But, it is all worth it when you put smiles on the faces of the people you'll help, and when you see stunning landscapes and places. Don't worry though, caring for animals isn't all you will do! You will have time to play games with your fellow Sea Cowboys. Whittling, playing cards, reading, volleyball and other fun things can be played when you are returning the ship after the animals have been unloaded.

If you love farm animals, pretty sights, fun breaks, and rides on the sparkling ocean on nice sunny days, this is definitly the job for you. Of course there are some down sides like storms, but if you take this job seriously, the view of sunup and sundown will make your day very happy!

Reason number one is the fact that you get to to take care of all the animals! The types of animals you take care of are: horses, young cows, mules, and more! You'll feed them, give them water, and clean there pens. If that doesn't sound nice to you, reason number two will definitly wake you at least kinda want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program

Reason number two was one of my favorites, the beautiful sights! On every trip, we see at the least one beautiful sight. We toured an exavated castle and it was very beautiful.

Reason number three is when we arrive on land, people unload the animals while we get to play a bunch of games! We play vollyball, baseball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing and more! If you aren't into thats stuff, you can always do something yourself like reading or whittling.

My last and final reason is the view of the beautiful ocean. On sunny days when the ocean is calm, you can go on the deck and just look at the way the sun shines on the ocean. Even at night the moon sometimes gives enought light to shine in the ocean, and it makes a very pretty reflection. If I had to describe the beauty two words they would be, very beautiful.

If being with animals, pretty sights, free time, and the sparking ocean didn't convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, I don't know what else will. To those of you that do join, good luck to you and I hope you have fun.                                               ",3,6,0.794226884841919

""Uhm I'm not sure luke, why would I join the Seagoing Cowboys program, like give me an idea of what it would be like"" Paul said

""Well you get to help out Europe and China by giving them horses, baby cows, goats and so on."", Luke said, ""You also get to see so many natural wonders, antiques, buildings from long long ago, and meet so many new and great people""

""Sounds fun but what about my kids and wife,they will miss me, and who will be man of the house after all I only have two girls with a mother that is sick. I'm sorry Luke I just can't go to many things to worry about"".

""Well why didn't you tell me that i would've got that taken care of no questions asked"", Luke said, ""I can call up your brother have him come up here and take care of the house and call a docter to take care of your wife, I know you would've called a docter if you had the money to, but I will pay for the docter visiting so you don't have to woory about money"".

In the meantime Luke called Dr. Philipe, (phil-EY-pay) called Saul, Paul's brother, asked if he could house sit for Paul, and payed for the docter visit and Saul's trip.

""So Paul, now can you go?"", Luke said

""Yes I can go"", said Paul

On the way to the Luke's barn that was on a hil next to the lake, they found multiple holes in the ground that hadn't been there before. ""I wonder where these came from?""

""Me too, maybe a giant worm or a mole"", Paul said

""Let's follow the holes to see where the main source is"". They followed the holes and it led them to the barn. They heard a lot of noise from the horses then the cows and then the chickens. ""What's going on in here"", Luke said. ALmost right after he said that he spotted a cottenmouth snake on of the most deadliest snakes of all, besides the viper.

""Oh my chicken nuggets, it's a snake"", Paul screamed. The snake heard Paul scream and turned around to face Paul. The sake bunched up and Luke said, ""Run!"" Paul was to late. The snake bit him on his ankle and Paul fell to the floor. Luke grabbed an iron horse shoe and threw it at the snake, missed the first time, but the second hit the snake in the head.

""Get away from my friend!"" Yelled Luke, ""Or I'll through another one!"" The snake just stayed there hissing at Luke. Luke threw another one and hit the snake again and killed the snake. Luke threw the dead snake out of the barn and got all the venom out of Paul.

""Lets go now"", Luke said. They left and was on the boat untill one of the horses saw a spider and ran towrds land. ""Let's just leave it after all we have 337 horses"", said Paul.

They left and was having the time of their lifes, seeing all type of sea creatures and weird fish. They made it to Europe and delived the animals safe and sound.

""So did you have fun?"" asked Luke.

""Yes, it is fun to get out of the house and two screaming girls and enjoy life while we still can"", said Paul

They made it to homeland and had the best welcome back party of their lifes. Luke said bye to Paul when Paul went on his next trip and Luke went home to do house chores.

If get you join the club you'll be saving lots of animals, people, plants,and habitats. The cows can be saved by building a farm. The animals like dear, wolfs, and squirrels and all the other animals can be saved by the forest. Sharks and fish and the other sea living animals can be saved by not putting polluted thing in the water. Snakes and the coyotes can be saved by helping the desert animals.

It gave me a lot of good life examples that i can look back on which is always good. Thats one of the resoins i think more people should go though it.

I think other people should do it because you get to see a lot of places. Like besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special. Thats only one of the many benefits of being in the program.

Another reson i think more people should join is that you get to be with all the cute animals. I know it sounds like hard work but it pays off . Caring for the animals kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Thats all just part of the job though which is good.

One other benifit of the job was when your not checking on the animals you have some free time. The cowboys played baceball and volleyball gmaes in the empty hold where the animals had beed housed. Table tennis tounaments, fencing,boxing,reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time. See yes you have to work but you also get some time to have fun.

Thats why i think more people should be a Seagoing Cowboy but being that is much more than an adventure. For me it opened up the world im grateful for the opportunity.

Through the time I've been here I've already helpped many animals get to the place they need to be at. Since I helpped out my aunt Katie on her farm it was easy to help the animals on bord. If you would join the Seagoing Cowboys program I could help you with anything you need, that involes the animals. If this is the only reason why you're sighning up, then you're in for more than what you expected.

Travel over seas and vist many places that include Itly, China, and many more. Even if you almost go over bord it's still worth being on the boat, unless you grew up around baots and can stay on bord if it's a bad storm. It's hard being a Seagoing Cowboy believe me I know, but it can be fun no matter what happens.

You can have fun with the others when we are on return trips we can play many sports that we want, since we don't have the animals. Even if we have the animals we can find somethings that are fun on the boat. To me it's fun already with or without the animals, because there are always people by your side, and you never get lonely.

If you do join there will be plenty of fun things to do I can't count them all, but I'm sure you can find something to do.

If you like to see stuff like Europe, Italy, China, Greece then you'll love it. If you don't believe me ask Luke he's the one whos been to all those places. He said that the boat trips were so unbelievable for a small town boy like him.

Also you will get to help people outside of your community. Like bring them food, water, and animals. It all ways feels good to help people in your own way. But it really effects peoples lives in the way you can help them. And it really doesn't take much to help those people.

But don't worry your not alone on this trip if you want company. You can make friends on the way like Luke did because after you give the animals to the people who need help there is room for things like Volleyball, Baseball, Table-tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling. These are all good things to pass the time after some hard work has been done.

So if you like to travel, help people, make friends and more then the Seagoing Cowboys program is for you and if noy maybe trying to recommend it to one of your friends who might like because I know Luke did.                             ",3,6,0.8711708784103394

a5b09cd,"Lukes point of view convincing others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is that the reason to join the program is because it makes you more aware of the people from many other countries and what their needs are. People out their may be suffering from illnesses or they can be dying. They also can be or get killed in and by wars. We should care more about the people out their while we still can because we are safe but others are not. We can save lives. The military helps us a lot by keeping us and our country safe. We don't want our population to drain down really fast because we are all family and together we can save lives. Can you imagine what Luke Bomberger had gone through. He had to check on animals every hour, he could have died by slidding on a slippery ladder on his backside. He also couldn't work because he had cracked ribs. Him and the crew had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. They had to work really hard. They had to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated because if not they would be kind of weak and would be tired most of the time. They probably wouldn't have enough strength for all that hard work they had to go through.",2,6,0.7084828019142151

His friend Don had asked him if he wanted to go on a cattle boat to Europe because after World War II it left most cities in ruins. Luke had no choice but to say yes. So in August of 1945 Luke and Don went to New Orleans to take apart in helping families. After getting their papers from the seaman they went and borded the SS Charles W. Wooster, they headed for Greece with a cargo of 355 plus horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Luke ended up turning 18 before arriving at Greece. Luke realized that he could be drafted for military service but everyone just told him to what he's doing now as his military service. On his second trip he served as night watchman after doing his hourly report to the captian it was a rainy night and the ladders were slick and Luke slipped down the ladder on his backside and almost feel feet first out of the ship into the dark Dark Atlantic Ocean. But a small piece of metal caught and saved him. He was happy to be alive. But he couldn't do anything for a couple days because of some cracked ribs. Luke said it's more fun on the way back because when they drop off the animals the stalls are empty and they can play games like baseball, table tennis, and volleyball. They all say it's one thing that cuts time off the journey. Luke also made nine trips the most anyone has ever made. THat is why Luke likes being a Seagoing Cowboy.",1,6,0.47450149059295654

While our main goal is to help others in need we also have fun while doing it. We have some time for sight seeing, and on the way back to the United States when the cattles is gone, we like to play games like basball and volleyball in the empty holds. We also like playing games like table tennis, fencing, and boxing.

I for one am very grateful that I got the opportunity, it made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs, and that awareness has stayed with me all my life. It is an excellent experience. But its not for everyone like i said earlier you should have some experience with cattle, and there is a lot of hard work involved.( Especially when your the night watchman.)

a624fc4,"Some people think the ""Seagoing Cowboy Program'' is a great program. Some people think otherwise. I think it is a great program, it helps people recover their food supplies, animals, and more. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. Particapating would be a great way to help out.

My first reason why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys Program"" is because it feels good to help people out who are in need. You would want them to help you if you were in trouble and needed to recover. You would get to sail the oceans, take care of animals, and do other fun activities. It does not get much better.

My second reason is that it changed my life and it could change yours too. It will feel tremendously good to help people recover. It is fun, but you can still make an impact on someones life. As well as taking care of the animals you would get to go sightseeing and do other activities. So all though this is like a mission to help others, it will still be very enjoyable.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. ""It opened up the world for me"". ""I'm grateful for the opportunity."" ""It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs."" ""That awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.""

So in conclusion, I would recommend joining the ""Seagoing Cowboys Program"" because I had a great time, but I still learned a lot and had my life changed. So if you decide to participate in this event, you will not be disapointed. There are many opportunities to help others and many opportunities to have a great time.           ",3,6,0.8800477981567383

Like if they are in the hostpitol you can help them or if they are out their then you can help them by telling them whats wrong and will maybe be tell you something like if they got hurt or maybe not but you can try your best to tell them whats wrong.

Another reason why we want you to join is that if you like animals then you can help animals like Horses, young Cows, and Mules we really want earth to be a happy place and that. We want animals to stay alive becasuse if we wouldn't have animals we wouldn't have any protien in our bodys and we wounldn't be as strong as usually.

This is a really big thing to people to have our help. It is a good idea to try and help out.

I have experienced from my aunt Katies farm as a young boy, I worked very hard so that prepared me,but not for the dangers of the sea. My job is to cheak on the animals every hour,its not all that bad. One night though it was pretty scary i was making my hourly report to the captain and some things happened. It wasnt that bad but im glad im here today. There is also lots of time to have fun on board. Like on return trips when the animals had been unloaded. I also played volleyball and baseball games with the cowboys in empty holds.

a69b0d6,"Boy am I glad there's no more homework!

Hi, my name is Luke, I just finished high school and want to become a doctor.

I love the idea of helping people.

That's why I'm signing up to become a ""Seagoing Cowboy.""

A Seagoing Cowboy is a person that goes on a boat across all kinds of different oceans to help countries that were effected by World War Two.

Also, I would like to become a Seagoing Cowboy because I would like to be remebered in different countries for heroic actions.

Not very many people can be famous for their actions in different places because there's no way to spread the news.

The only people that really remember you are the people that you tell, or the people that you helped.

I think it would be cool to be known all around the world.

I also think it would be cool to travel around the globe to explore.

Most off all, I want my mother to be proud of me, and I want to make history.

That is way I was super excited when I was accepted to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

I am going to be traveling around the world!

To me, that is a dream come true.

The only bad thing was, my mother was not proud, in fact, she wasn't happy at all.

She thought becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would put me in danger, in danger?

I was helping people, how could that be dangerous, I thought to myself?

I was NOT giving up on becoming a Seagoing Cowboy.

I just had to convince my mom, and the rest of my family, that helping other people wasn't as bad as they thought.

Also that I would be very careful on the boat so that I did not get hurt.

""Mother,"" I called into the house I call home.

""Yes, Luke,"" called a sweet voice from the kitchen.

""I would like to talk to you about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy.""

I was very nervous that I would not be able to convince my mother about what I thought.

I wondered if I would even be able to convince her, or if I was wasting my time.

I was going overseas anyway, no matter what my mother said, because this is my dream.

My mother's voice broke me out of my thoughts.

""Oh, yes, I have been meaning to talk to you about that very topic."" I was glad that at least my mother didn't seem angry with my actions.

""I just wanted to say that I will be very careful when I am overseas, and I promise that I will not get hurt in anyway possible."" I wanted my mother to know that I wasn't lying any bit when I say that.

""I believe you, it is not you I do not trust.

It is that men that will be on the boat with you. You do not know any of them, or what their history is, how do you know if they are dangerous of not?""

""I just wanted you to know that I am going overseas tomorrow.""

The rest of the night was a blur, I told my mom why I wanted to do this so much, and eventually, she gave in.

She said that she supported me in becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, and that she was always proud of me, only nervous.

I did go overseas the next morning, and enjoied it a lot.

I went to many places and saw many natural wonders.

Who knew how beautiful other places were.

A lot of places were very different than were I live.

Most of all, I was very glad that I got to help other people along the way.

In fact, I was very suprised how good it felt to know that I touched so many lives.

Oh, and did I mention that I have the record for how many trips one Seagoing Cowboy has done! I'm at eight right now, and I am thinking about going on one last trip before going home for good.

I can not wait to stay home and spend lots and lots of time with my family.

You wouldn't believe how long it has been since a have had some of my mother's homemade pudding!

I can not wait to have some, and when I say mother's homemade pudding, I mean homemade heaven!

Even though I have enjoied this experience very much, I will be glad to go home.

I have seen many cool creations.

For example, the Panama Canal, and I toured an excavated castle!

I've really be happy with the accomplishments I have overcome in the past few years.

a6ac854,"I believe that more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. There are many reasons to do so and claims too. Some may not agree, but they should know that joining this can be very helpful to people around the world.

One reason people should join is because they get to see the world over. You can look at many different landmarks different while helping people at same time. I know that if you join this program you have many responsibilities, but you will have time to look around at least see the sights. Luke Bomberger, a man who joined the

Seagoing Cowboys, was able to go see many Europe and China such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, an excavated castle in Crete, and Panama Canal on his way to China.

Another reason why you should join is because you'll usually never be bored. There will always be something to do on the ship. Going back to Luke Bomberger, he stated that he fun on ship after animals were unloaded. They played baseball and volleyball in empty holds were animals used to be. They also did table-tenis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games as well.

Final reason to reason to join is you'll be helping many people who are in need. If don't know already, many people in different countries don't the items need for survival, and they need them desprately. As a Seagoing Cowboy you'll be providing them many animals that can give them those items.

In conclusion,more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. You'll be able to travel around the world, you'll be able to find fun, and help people in need. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy will be a good choice in your life.  ",3,6,0.8450109362602234

I say this because for example the program lets u go around the world,like in the story the said that Luke had travewled nine diffrent times. Isnt that great that could be you,of course if u would like to join.

There are lots of things that u could do there,like get to meet knew people and some might even become very close to you. I am sure that if you, came to the program you would love it. You would have fun,free food,and a good place to sleep. Now some might lo0ve animals , and if u dont thats fine but im sure you would start to. they are kind,loving,and gental. This program might get u in shapeand fit,you will be caring and lifting things and im sure that will burn off some fat.

Also if u come to the program,u would learn how to obay,clean,and be respectful. Im sure that a young mans mother would be happy to know that,they are cleaning, and obaying laws,and showing respecfulness. Oh and befor i forget, they also will be able to cook multipal meals for his family.

The lastly they will be cowboys,and thats a great thing to help out with the animals. The young men will be helping around with horses,and cows. I am sure that the young man, will enjoy the view of the world that hes traviling.

a73619b,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to cross the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean? Have you ever wondered what dangers could happen while at sea? Have you ever thought about how the work done as a child can benefit how you are as an adult? Well, if any of these questions has even came to your mind than this essay is perfect for you.

Crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans would take a long time but I would say that it is worth it. Luke Bomberger traveled across the Atlantic six-teen times and he crossed the Pacific twice. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program so that you can travel across the oceans too. While onboard a Seagoing Cowboys' ship you can have baseball and volleyball games, you can have ping-pong tournaments (also known as table tennis), fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and playing all sorts of fun games to pass through the days onboard your ship. There are so many advantages to joining the Seagoing Cowboys but if you aren't sure if it will be safe then I will write about the little disadvantages of coming onboard.

So, your wondering about the disadvantages of joining the Seagoing Cowboys? Well, one day Luke Bomberger was working at his job as a night watchman and he had to check on the animals on board every hour. One night Luke slipped on a latter and he cracked his ribs. Luke started sliding toward the edge of the ship where a small strop of metal kept him from flying overboard. So if you think almost plumaging into the deep, dark sea is a disadvantage then there you go. Just because something dangerous ""could"" happen doesn't mean that it should hold you back from doing something that you could enjoy though. If you never try out something than you will never know if you will like it or not, so I suggest joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

Kids are always wondering why they have to do so much work. The reason is so that the work that they do as a child will benefit them while they are older. Luke Bomberger had worked on his aunt Katie's farm as a little boy and it had prepared Luke for hard work to be done at sea. You need to be able to work hard if you are going to join the Seagoing Cowboys than you need to ""work hard at work worth doing"" (quoted from Teddy Rosavelt).

If you like adventure than the Seagoing Cowboys program is perfect for you. Remember that this program isn't just about fun but it is also about working hard. There may be danger while at sea but it's a low chance that the danger will affect you. So join the Seagoing Cowboys and have the time of your life!",3,6,0.8170872926712036

The first one is that it was absolutely fun!

The second reason is that I got to get the chance to really help others.

Lastly, I got to experience a lot of amazing things.

The first reason that I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that it was so much fun!

I got to tour so many new places that I had never even dreamed of getting to see.

I got to see Europe, and China, even the Acropolis in Greece!

That was my favorite part of the trip.

Another reason that I think you should join this program is that you get to help people.

I got to help so many others.

During World War 2, so many countries lost everything.

We helped these countries greatly.

We restored food, animals, and so much more to them.

I think that they are extremely grateful.

The last reason I think that the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great group to participate in, is that I experienced so many new things there.

War is never a pretty thing, and I got to see that.

You might not want to see this, but I've realized how important it is to help the people that have lost things.

After I saw the remains of this war, I realized how hard it was for the people.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is fun.

First I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it is a great oppurtunity to go help other people around the country who are struggling for food and for their farms. You could help with rebuilding the town. Also it is a great way to go see different parts of the world you havent seen before. When I had started I didnt relize how much it would be to ride a boat with my friend and go to different parts of the country.

Next I think this is a great program for young adults who want to make a difference and help other people around the world. This is a way for young adults to see other parts of the world. They can go on an adventure to a country in Europe or Africa. It's a way for them to interacted with different people in the world.

Lastly some details to support my claim are to help people who lost many things in a war or in a fight with another country. Many people have lost many things in

wars and riotes or even protest. I took the risk to leave my life behind to go help other peoples lives.

It was an awesome trip for Luke and it can be your awesome trip too, without Luke going he would still be working 2 jobs and trying to figure out what to do for his career. And Luke thought it himself "" He couldnt say no, he knew it would be an opportunity of a lifetime.""

Going to

Europe is very exciting but, doing the work is important. Once Luke and his friend went to Europe they had to get to work right away. They had to take care of the animals so, they had to clean the stalls and they had

all the hay and oats they needed so they had to feed the animals with water of course, 2 or 3 times a day. But, Europe didnt have much supplies so they had to help and get all the supplies they needed to survive and so thaey can work. Without working for the country you signed up for, there is really no point to be there.

Why helping out and working is good. Europe needed desprite help with all the stuff they needed. And of course, You have to help them. Luke and his friend did all the work they could to help people survive and so they can work. In August they recieved new orders to new Orleans ""We arrived August 14"" Luke says. With a cargo of 335 horses plus feeding them it was alot of work. That is why working is good.

Finally, you did it and you are glad. Luke and his friend made it all over the Atlantic ocean and helped the people and animals in Europe and they did a succesful job working.

First,some reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program are, getting discoverd. For example,if your 18 like I was you could be drafted for military service which means you would be able to help the world and have a great job. Another reason, you should join is because,you can discover some amazing things. For example, you could see places like europe,china,italy and greece. Also you will be helping a lot of people and animals because,you will be doing things for the benefit of there need. All of these examples show reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program.

Next,but for me being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure.''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Just like it made me look at the world diffrent it might be the same to you or even an acheivment you have accomplished. Their are some reasons you might be scared to go. For example you might be scared of failing or being flown over board. But as long as you stay together with the person your with and do what your supposed to you wont fail.

Another good reason of going to the seagoing cowboys program is helping people. World war 2 was over in europe and many countries were left in ruins and if you want to help all the people in ruins you could join the seagoing cowboys program. UNRRA hired the ''seagoing cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. So from what the UNRRA said that means you probly would be getting paid. Even if you dont get paid its still a good thing to do to help people that need help. All of these reasons state why this is a good reason to join the program.

In conclusion,all these reasons I have stated will really help people. Helping is what the seagoing cowboys program is about and it will make you more aware of things like other countries in need. If your not 18 yet and you want to be drafted for military service join more than once because, the more you join the more your helping the people,animals,and enviorment.

You could play all kinds of fun games with the people on board the ship.

After you drop off the cattle food and supplies what are you going to do.

Well all that space that the animals were in is now open for baseball game.

That's right you could play a baseball game on a ship like that.

Just don't hit a home run too far.

You could play games, read, and even play a baseball game and who says that isn't fun.

Another good thing about Seagoing Cowboys is that you can see amazing sights.

You could ride past China.

You could almost go anywhere you wanted, after the cattle were dropped off.

Sightseeing is a very fun thing to do.

You can see stuff you have never seen before.

I think it would be kind of fun to be a seagoing cowboys out would miss your relatives though.

Remember why being a seagoing cowboy is fun.

The job is a fun amazing job.

You will have friends on board.

The ride home will be amazing.

There would be a lot of sightseeing on the trip.

Those are the reasons you should be a seagoing cowboy.",3,6,0.7983638644218445

And maybe he could do it but sleeping on a boat? Won't that be uncofortable. I've never slept on a boat but going through all the waves, the boat moving side to side, the sound of waves hitting the boat. You wouldn't get some good sleep.

Some people get sick on the boats. And you have to go through that every single day. The article said it took about two weeks to get across the pacific ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to China. That's like sitting in vomet for a month.

What would you have to eat every day. You can't keep food on a boat for a month. The boat would only be filled with food. Unless your going to have the same thing every day. That would be boring. I wouldn't do that!

There had to be a rainy day or even a storm at one point in that month. What would you do all day? You have no internet, you can't really play unless your playing cards. If its raining then it's going to be very slippery. So you would have to stay in place for a while. And when the rain stops, you still need to be cautios that you don't slip

It says in this article that, Luke had to serve the night watching for animals. Will you get any sleep? Will you fall asleep on the job. What i'm trying to say is you need sleep. I couldn't stay up all night and then stay up all day. I would have to take a nap.

Now the reasons I would join the ship. It says that Luke had fun on the boat, the cowboys played volleyball games. They also had table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

If I had the choice to become a Seagoing Cowboy, I wouldn't go. I would miss all my friends and family. And yes you would have a lot of fun but, you couldn't see your friends. You couldn't see the people you wanted to see. And i'm happy where I live and where I go to school. I never want to leave. But for Luke it was something I guess he wanated to do.

You would feel good about helping people and be happy that when they have children it was because you had saved the parents of the kids.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it is an oppurtunity of a lifetime and can change many peoples mind. You will get to see things you never get to see. Everyone can be able to help people in trouble and meet other people different from you.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you will know new things and learn new skills. You can also teach them your language and learn theirs. You will also be able to do things that you never done before.

When you join and go on trips, you can do cool things to use as a conversation starter. You can also learn stories and legends from around the world and tell it to your hometown. You can make people envious and make them wanna go the trip as well. You can also speak of things you never thought of doing and did it.

So in the end, you have learned about why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys from Luke's side. I talked about how it is an oppurtunity of a lifetime,how you can learn new things,and how you can talk about your amazing trip and incounter with people. This would be an amazing oppurtunity.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things he did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games.

In the passage Luke said that he enjoyed the job A lot. There was many things he got to do like go over seas,he rescued animals,and more. It states in paragraph 3 that he traveled with 335 horses on August,14,1945. In my opinion that is a lot of horses on one boat.

He got to travel many places like Europe,China,Greece and more. He said that it takes about two weeks to get to cross the Atlantic ocean and a month to get to China. left time to play baseball,vollyball,tabletennis,fencing,boxing reading,and more. it says in the intro in the passage that he traveled 16 times over the Atlantic Ocean and twice over the Pacific Ocean.

Taking care of the animals is pretty simple. They need to be fed (bales of hay and bags of oats are hauled up from the lower holds), watered (two or three times a day), and the animal's stalls have to be cleaned. Another job is being a night watchman. It can be very dangerous.

Another reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you can have lots of fun. On the return trip, when all the animals are gone and the stalls are empty, cowboys play baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, and many other games. Table-tennis tournaments are also held.

aa51a19,"Why should you join the Seagoing Cowboys program? There are many different reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Some of the reasons you should join I am about to tell you.

The first you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is so you could help people over seas and in other countries. A boy named Luke Bomberger got to do all of the things that you could be able to do, by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The next reason you should join the program, is that you could get to see many unique places all over the world. A lot of people do not get to see some of the things that you could be able to see during the Seagoing Cowboys program. After the animals are unloaded and you have some free time, you could so site seeing and do all of it for free! Luke Bomberger got to do this while visiting many different countries for free. Now that is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that you could travel all over the world for free! That is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You don't get to travel to places for free very often. Luke Bomberger had the chance to go to many different countries and see many different things in those countries.

The fourth reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program; is that when you are in the different countries and you have freetime over in those places, is that you can meet people and learn their about cutures. Luke got to go see and meet new people during his free time while people were still unloading the animals, and probably learned new things about those peoples cultures too.

One of the other reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that you can learn a lot of survival skills on the ships that you are on. If you ever are a capatin of a ship in the Seagoing Cowboys program or in any program, is that you will already know how to control a ship, keep your ship members in order, and know what to do when you are on that ship. Luke Bomberger got to learn a few things on how to contol a ship and what to do when a storm hits and you sail right through the storm.

The sixth reason that you should join the program is that you could meet new people on the ship and get to know them. A lot of people do not have friends or just want to be more social. A way you could do that is by joining the program. After all of the animals are unloaded and you are heading back to your home to pick up more animals, you could play games with some of your ship members. Luke Bomberger got to meet new people and probably made some new friends while on some of those trips, even though he already had a friend that was going with him on the ships and things.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you can spend a lot of time with animals. After you are finished with the program, and you need to find a job, you could open a new farm and already know how to take care of most of your animals. When Luke was on the ship he already knew how to take care of the animals but he probable go to learn new things on how to take care of them.

Those are the reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You get to help people, see unique places, you could travel all ofver the world, you get to learn about peoples cultures, you can learn a alot of survival skills, you can meet new people on the ship and make friends, and you get to learn a lot about animals and how to take care of them.

aa66e68,"Have you ever wanted to get away from home, see the world, and have the amazing opportunity to help others?

If you have, this is the job for you!

Sign up to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy.""

You can travel the world, meet all kinds of people, all while helping many people in need.

Have you ever wanted a way to fill your service time, without actually having to fight?

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is the best way to do it!

I served two years in service before I was discharged, without ever stepping foot near a weapon, battlefield, or military base.

While others risked their lives, I was taking care of horses and cattle, seeing the world, and helping others without ever having to be in dangerous situations.

Another reason I was happy to have joined the Seagoing Cowboys is, like I've said before, I had the rare and amazing experience of seeing parts of the world I would never get to see.

I saw places such as Europe and China, but what really was special was seeing the Acropolis in Greece.

I was also breath taken when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, as I called it ""a city with streets of water.""

I also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Without becoming a Seagoing Cowboy I never would have had any of these amazing experiences.

Besides helping out with others, getting to see amazing places, and filling my service time, I had fun on the trip itself!

I enjoyed tending to the animals (and this will be especially fun for people who love or appreciate live stock), we had table-tennis tournaments, we fenced, boxed, whittled, and played many other games.

Of course you could bring books or board games along with you as well!

On the return trip after we had already unloaded the animals we could play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed.

Perhaps the best part about this is that when I signed up, I was a normal boy with a highschool degree and working two part-time jobs.

I didn't have to have any certification, degrees, or even a full time job.

I was completely average until I signed up.

If you wanted to, you could sign up right now without a degree or training.

Last but not least, this job will make you aware of how lucky you are that you have the opportunites you have, that your country isn't war stricked, that we aren't completely devastated.

Joining this really helped me and my family realise this fact.

To recap, there are many different reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Get away from home for a time, while visiting places like China or Italy, have lots of fun playing games on deck and tending to the animals, all while filling your service time, plus you don't have to have any special qualification! The whole ordeal really made me happy of my current life; it helped me realise how lucky I am.

One reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you get to see different places along the way.

During one trip I had the benefit of being able to see Europe and China.

Also being able to see the Acropolis in Greece made it more special.

When you join this program you will see it as a opportunity, for me it was an unbelivable opportunity for a small-town boy like me.

Another reason to join this program is there is also sometimes where you get to have fun on board.

We would mostly have fun on our return trips after we had unloaded the animals. We would play baseball, volleyball and other stuff like fencing, boxing, and reading.

This program is not just taking care of animals you get time to entertain yourself and do somethings you want to do.

The last reason you should join this program is you might not just see it as an adventure but it gives you the opportunity to help others.

This adventure was more than adventure to me it opened my mind to the world around me.

This will make you aware of the people of other countries and their needs, this trip made me.

When you help these people it will make you feel special.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program, It is an amazing experience. Think about you get to see new things, you get time for lot of fun on board, and you the special feeling of helping someone.

Well I think people shouldn't join the Seagoing Cowboys Program because of getting sea sick, maybe getting lost, or even dying.

First, getting sea sick. People who get sea sick probaly die of the disease or even get really sick. I can infer this is the number one reason for not going on boats people came up with.

Secondly, maybe getting lost in the ocean. Lots of people had this problem before but maybe not today. People can die or even just end up somewhere away from their families at home awaiting for their arrival. I can infer this happend alot to people who forgot which way to go to land.

Last, dying. This has happend because of either disease faling off the ship and being stranded or even starvation or drought. Another reason is because of other people attacking them. I can infer this happened often to people who did not pay attention to where they were going or to anything

abd70b9,"The Seagoing Cowboys is a great program, but being one is better. The cowboys go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowboys would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him he could do that for his service. So if your a Seagoing Cowboy it counts as being in the military service.

My conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowboy can ""open someones eyes"" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Seagoing Cowboys are very persistent, and if you like animals you should join this program. Because when Luke fell and slid on the ship, he almost fell off because he was helping the animals. And when Luke cracked his ribs on the ship, he didn't quit, he kept being a Seagoing Cowboy, and continued to help the animals.

These are just a few of the places that we go to so the horses can get where they need to be. We will go way across the world just to deliver horses.

Luke had no friends when he came other than the friend that asked him to go with him to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke made many new friends on the boat. He made 9 (nine) trips all together from that whole career that he had with that job. He had fun and learned new things about boats and horses.

He thought it was going to be a chance of a life time but he changed his mind it being completely amazing better than what he thought it would be for someone like him. His journeys were amazing and he loved it and his family was very proud of him and his friend. He said he is grateful for the opportunity.

The purpose of the Seagoing Cowboys was to bring livestock and food for the livestock so they could live and eat so they wouldn't to stay without shelter.

food so they brought and the reason luke knew how to do all that hard work was because he helped out a bunch on his aunt's farm with cattle and horses and on Lukes second trip he was a watchman at night so no one would steal i would think.

Then later on that night he ended up breaking some ribs because he crashed into the metal strip on the side of the ship so he wouldnt fall in the ocean.

If you're reading this article, I'm guessing you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy. It's an interesting job. It doesn't require any special skills or years and years of experience. You just have to know how to take good care of animals and not get seasick easily. It's not that hard. Read on; I'll show you why.

There are a lot of great reasons to join the program. Here are some. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy,(Yes, I was!) along with helping other countries get back on their feet, I got to see awe-inspiring things, such as the Acropolis in Greece and the Panama Canal on my way to China. Taking care of the animals wasn't that hard. Sure you had to clean the poop-ridden stalls and carry up heavy bags of oats, but the animals made great company. On rides back home, you could relax and play games with the rest of the crew.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy could be dangerous, too. Once, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down a slippery ladder and almost went overboard and died! Luckily I got away with only a broken rib and more caution. People in the countries we aided could've been hostile. Seas could've been violent. Storms could've broken our ship to bite-size pieces. Fortunately, none of that happened;most of my trips were safe ones

When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, it opened up the world to me. I saw that the world wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the little me thought.

I think that you should particapate in the Seagoing Cowboys Program because you could explore all of the oceans. Also you could see Europe and many other countries. You could help all of the people that need food supplies, animals, and more. To support this in the text it says ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

Also I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program beause it was an oppurtinity to have fun on board. I know this because in the text it says ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

ad4257d,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" it gives information about a certain group called the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get to take care of animals for your service to your country in stead of having to be in the military. According to the fourth paragraph when Luke turned eighteen before getting to Greece, he would've had to automatically draft into the military. But, when the draft board learned that he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to just stay their for his service. Point being if you serve by being a Seagoing Cowboy you wouldn't have to be in the military enless you choose to be in it.

There are many reason's provided in the story to be a Seagoing Cowboy but one that also seems to stick out above some of the others is the sight's you see. According to paragraph five it says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece wasspecial,"" he says.""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China."" Which means that if you're a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see a bunch of unique places that most people don't get to see everyday.

For my last reason that I found stated in the text to be a Seagoing Cowboy is it opens up a new world for you. As stated in the text paragraph nine ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him."" which shows that it teaches you and what caring for others does for you and last it shows sights you don't get to see 24/7. To conclude the paragraph being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than seeing things you haven't seen before outside of pictures and going on adventures it's a great learning experience.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get the great delight of caring for others, adventure, sight-seeing, and a great learning experience.

Dear, jimmy

I heard you may want to be a seagoing cowboy. Being a seagoing cowboy is a great adventure and it teaches you a lot of things. Well let's make you'r decision final.

One good reason to be a seagoing cowboy is you get to help pople who have sufferd and have lost many realitives. You can draft for military service, but you do have to be 18 to draft for military service. I have had the most time of any seagoing cowboy my time is nine trips. Mabye you could beat my recored one day. Besides helpig people you could have the benifit of seeing places such as Europe, China, Greece, or Italy.

When your traveling the high seas it could take a while to get to your destination. For me it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China. You may have to take care of the animals for the crossings and this will keep you busy for a while. Some thing that you will have to do to take care of the animals is to feed and give them water two times a day. Also you will have to pull up bags of oats and hay from the lower holds. last but not least the stalls will have to be cleaned. once on my second trip I served as a watchman and I slid down a slippery ladder luckly a long strip of metal kept me from going into the seas.

There will be some times when you can have fun on board especially on the return trips because there wont be any animals in the stalls.

When we could have fun we would go into an empty stall and play tabble tennis, fencing, boxing, reading,whittling,vollyball, and even baseball.

But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure. It opened up the world to me. Im very gratful for this oppurtunity. It has made me more aware that others may need are help.

Seagoing Cowboys program is a program where you go out on a big boat and you go on the seas and travel to different crountries.

I am first going to tell you why you should go. You should go to the program because you get to see all different kind of countries like Greece, China, and Europe. Why would you not want to go to different countries. Other people might say it's way to dangerous because you might run out of food or the boat might sink and you might get lost while you are out in the seas. You will not run out of food because the person who is encharge packs 6 months of food. If the boat does sink, there will be another boat behind us. You will not get lost because there will be other people there with you and there will be maps.

When you get to a country like Venice,Italy there will be a city with streets of water so we can stay in the boat. What you can see at the different countries is where people live, what kind of houses does the people live in, and you will be aloud to take pictures so you will never forget your time at the countries and the boat.

So that is why you should go to the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will have alot fun while you will be on the trip. So make sure you pack alot of clothes and pack your bag for a avdevture.",3,6,0.7983521223068237

To Whom It May Concern,

Have you ever met someone who is or was a seagoing cowboy? Well, if your awnser is no then it's all about to change. Hi my name is Luke, and I am a seagoing cowboy. I really want to encorage other's to become seagoing cowboys because we need more people to complete the jobs. So come on out and serve your country with the seagoing cowboys!

First of all, I have multiple reasons why should join us. Like its a lot of fun. Ok, so you didn't hear this from me but some times after we drop the cattle off we like to go into the empty stalls and play games like tennis and volley ball. Due to that this job really dosen't feel like a job at all. If you like to have fun and take care of animals then a seagoing cowboy is the right job for you. Also, this is a once in a lifetime chance. When I was offered this deal I jumped on it immediantly because I knew that if I didn't that I would never get another chance like this again. Plus, you probally wont have to join the military. For me this counted as my service.

Futhermore, we do many things in this program such as take care of animals. I get to go down everyday to feed them and I always am able to pet and play with them. As I said before we also play many games to keep us entertained because we have alot of time on our hands. So everyday is like another mini party. As you probally know we have to drive a huge boat filled with animals across the ocean. So we alternate drivers. We always want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to have fun and sleep. But, even though were making amazing memoriess all of us need to do are fair share of the work .

Finally, I have many memories of my own to share. Starting with I made a record by heading out on a cattle trip 9 times! Maybe you could also set a record? I know that I have made it pretty clear that I have had fun. But I have also gotten my share of bumps and bruises over the years. Beside that is no match to the pain I felt before this job. Here I feel safe and in my old life I didn't. I was working 2 part time jobs. One at a grocery store and one at a bank. Plus I didnt get very good py and I wasn't happy. But now I am. Everyday is amazing thanks to my job that is so great that it dosen't even feel like one.

So in conclusion I love my job! I think that you should try it out. If it dosen't sound appealing to you then just give it a spin. I really do belive that you will like it as much as I did. Maybe you can set a new world recored! Or maybe just a pearsonal one. But which ever record you want to set or what job you pick, just pick the one that makes you happy. Dont go out and do somthing boring like I did at first. Just find what you love and do it. You only live one life one time. So why not live it to the fullest?

Best Wishes,

Luke!",4,6,0.821160078048706

There will also be something for you to do all the time because you will have to feed and water the animals two to three times a day according to the story. You still can have fun to as it is mentioned in the story they still played baseball table-tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling as it helps pass time too.

What Luke is trying to say is that if you get this job the world will open up to you, you will see more things you will also see the needs that people dont have like I mentioned in the beginning.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small- town boy,"" he says. ""Beside helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says. "" So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with street of water. ""

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It is not all just fun and games for Luke. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second tripLuke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, After making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first towardan opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. He was happyto be alive. But he couldn't work a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful the opportunity.""

he says.

""It made me more aware of people of countries and there needs."" And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years.

You are wondering what the Seagoing Cowboys are, right? Well it is a group of people who get together and help all over the world with taking care of animals that would would typically would would find in a barn.

What we do is they take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. It is a fun thing to do because you can be helping animals but also see all over the world and get to see cool and new stuff! Chances are you most likely haven't been to most place we go to.

I remember one time we had to ride a cattle-boat. people were alittle mad that they had to ride on a cattle-boat with a bunch of cattle. We were on a cattle-boat trip. It was pretty amazing and we also got to see Europe and China! People started to lighten up after they founf out that we were going to two wonderful places! It was the best trip we've ever been on!

Usually it takes about 2 weeks to get to the place we want to go. That's because we take a boat and sometimes we run into some bad weather, but if you just relax an denjoy it it will go by super, super fast! The bad weather can be bad that is why we have to take as much protection as we can! So, if you do join the Seagoing Cowboys make sure you have the right gear and you dress for the weather. Sometime it can be very cold when we are on the boat and then it can be SUPER hot when we get to our destination. Just make sure that you are always perpared and never not perpared!

If you get sea sick or homesick easy then it is not a good idea to join! If you get sick when we are there then you can't go home you have to stay with us at all times! So, it might be a good idea to bring stuff tha helps you feel better. It might be smart to bring medicine with you so you do not have too buy it somewhere else where it is expensive.

Well I hope that you join because we need sone extras hands! If you would like to sign up then PLEASE DO SO as soon as possible! Thank you very much!                                                                                        ",3,6,0.8206717371940613

He was to check on all of the animals and it was rainy out and he sliped and fell down very wet steps he almost slid out of the boat but a lucky peace of meatal beam was there and he stop right before he went out of an open side of the boat. but this put him on medical leave so he couldent work so I bet he was a little upset that he couldent help on the boat or where ever they stoped to help on land.

af8c1c9,"A Seagoing Cowboy is a cowboy who travels overseas to a different country and take animals/supplies there that they are in need of. This job takes a lot of work. You have to watch all the animals every hour, clean their stalls, and feed them. This job does take a lot of work, but it is a unique experience one will never forget. You get to Help other countries in need after the war, see amazing countries and sights , and have fun with new friends you get to meet while traveling. It is a great experience.

After World War ll, several countries were left in destruction. This meant that someone needed to help fast, and get the people food, animals, and other supplies that were needed. 44 nations came together as UNRRA, also known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"", like myself. We help deliver horses, young cows, and mules to the countries in need. It feels so great to help other people, and I will never forget all the smiling faces I saw when I arrived with their animals. It is a wonderful sight.

When you visit several countries, you never realize how wonderful and amazing they can look, even after a war! Places like Europe, China, Greece, Italy, and the list countinues. After we deliver the animals, we get to have a little bit a of fun before we go back, so we get to go to tourist attractions, and popular cities in the country. I was able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, where the streets are made up of water. I also got to see the Acropolis in Greece. Those trips were pretty special! There are so many great things to see and do in every country, so no matter where you go, you will have a great adventure exploring the cities, and having a ton of fun!

While being on a boat, traveling to a country, you have to watch over the animals every so often. That is not the case on your way back, when the animals are gone from your boat at the country you just visited. Since the animals are gone, you can do whatever you want to do to make the time pass. We do things such as table-tennis, volleyball, boxing, fencing, baseball, reading, and more fun games. You really can't play things games without people to play with, which is a great way to make friends. Since you probably don't know the people working with you, you can get to know them, and make new friends. This is one of my favorite parts of being a Seagoing Cowboy, because without becoming friends with your co-workers, you job isn't fun. It's a great way to open up, and whats more fun then going over-seas with your friends and having a good time?

In conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is an amazing experience because you get to help others in need after the war, see amazing places/sights, and have tons of fun while making new friends with the people you work with. You will have so many great memories of your time at every country. Become a Seagoing Cowboy today!",5,6,0.7949362993240356
afb25f6,"Hello my name is luke soon after I graduated My best friend asked me to join a program were we help victims of World War II.My first impression of the ship was that it did not look good but as soon as I got in it was pretty nice there was a man waiting for us to give us the keys to our rooms and work clothes.

The first trip I went on I had to feed the animals, wash their pins, and check on them on the hour. The job I had was not as bad

as it sounds their pins were actually clean the majority of the time so I really did not have to do much work, beside handing out food and checking on the animals.

In our free time on the ship we could play baseball, volleyball, widling, and basketball. when we get to our stop we get off deliver the animals to the victims of the war. After were done with that we get back on the ship for another three weeks to go back to America.

When we get back we spend two to three months at home then we go on another trip. When they called me to notify me about the next trip and that the boat was leaving in three days I had to hurry up and get my stuff packed. I got my friend Don from his house and we drove New Orleans and boarded the SS Charles and headed of two see

this time aboard I had night watch duty so I had two check on the animals hourly and see if they were okay. when we were done with helping people we had free time so Don and I went to visit some national landmarks. It was a wonderful experience for me I had a lot of fun helping people and seeing the landmarks like the Panama Canal, an excavated castle in Crete, and I alsogot to take a gandola ride in Venice,Italy.

that is why I think you should go on the tour it is a fun time helping people and it is a great experience to tour the world. that is why u should join.",4,6,0.639947235584259

""Wow, I Just had a dreamed about when I started to become a seagoing cowboy, man those were the doy days."" ""Well time for breakfast"" I said. Then Like went downstairs and ate some bread. Then I went outside and went to the store and buy some food. Then he went to his family's house to talk to some of the visitors.

May 20, 1950 11:00 A.M.

the next day I got up and did the some the same thing as yesterday but today was a bit different because today My friend Don was trying to find me. Don was able to find me at the ice shop and said that we need to go the Seagoing cowboys program today to teach any of the people who has signed up.

1:34 P.M.

When got there, the place when they held the program was different becaue no one was there. Then we was a sign that said"" ANY EXPERIENCED SEAGOING BOYBOYS COME IN."" ""Ok then"" said Don. Then we When inside there were some old Seagoing Cowboy I remenber.

1:40 P.M. 1950

Then an old man got up and said, "" Thank you you all for coming, I am her to tell you than we need your help."" ""What kind of help?"" asked some Seagoing Cowboy. Well we need you all to go on a little trip back to Europe to help some People out over there becuase some the Students over there needs some adive about some of the jobs you did back in 1945. ""Ok, sure thing"" said most of the Seagoing cowboys. but some of the rest asked 'what, why??"" Well the ship leaves the next day so pack some of your things you well need.

May 21, 1950 Noon

Don and I got on the Ship and into a bunk room. ""Well just like old times"" said Don

""yup"" I said back. ""Well I am going to explore the ship do you come?"" I asked. ""How about we unpack out things."" Don said ""Ok"" I said.

June 2, 1950 9:00

""there is a thunder storm out side I wonder if lighing is going to hit the ship?"" I asked. The odds of that .. BOOOM!!! Then the alarm came one and said everyone to get to the life boats. Don and I tried to pack our thing but we only pack hlaf of our things and that fell over board while we got in to the life boats.

June ? 1950 ?:??

Don and I woke up one the beach of a nearby city with a few Seagoing Cowboys. ""Where are we??"" asked Don ""I don't know"" I said.      ",1,6,0.5652663111686707
aff6bdc,"I think that they should have more people join/help with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I think they should have more peoople beacuse then it will incluse having more help instead of having so many animals with not so amny opeople. For example, if you had ten/10 cows and one/1 person then it would be harder . But if you had al least five/5 people helping then you would have half as many which might/would have a big effect on how much more help is nedded/wanted.

What if you put it at a diffrent point/thought. As in, what if those cows and horses were going to little kids? And they were for example going to use them for 4-H because if then would it make other people want to join? For the kids sake? Would you think that would make more people join? More people help? More people to ""get involved""?

I think if we brought it to people's attention that, joining this could possibly ""save an animal"". If you really think about it you could even save a farm, because cows produce milk and some poeple cant even afford milk and thing that you could get from these animals that are in this program. The following problem about the farm.

And a cool part about helping would be you could go overseas if you join the program. And if you have a mind like Luke then, as qouted in this passage "" I would be glad to have this opertunity. And another great benifit out of helping/joining, is as said in the story, ""Table-Tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and alson games to help times to pass by.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs"". And if you think about it with this being quoted/said in the passage it could teach people a real lesson about others inneed of others help. So this could be

""Learning Opertunity"". So this is could teach people another reason on how they arent the only ones ineed.

All these reasons are things that support my answer on how I think that they should have more pople join/help in the Seagoing Cowboys Program.",2,6,0.569219708442688
b015474,"You should go to the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should go there, because you get to see all over the world. For xample that shows you get to go all over the world is that, Luke went to China, the Atlanic Ocean, and the United States of America. Another example is that you get to go with your friends sometimes to trips on a boat, like when Luke went to Europe with Don. Also Luke went to go to different Countries and States, that's way more fun other then just saying in one country and state.

You should also go to Seagoing Cowboys program, because you get to see different animals and plants, that where unloaded on the boat from different states and countries. Maybe if you went to this program you would get to see different animals and plants from different States and Countries. Plus Luke crossed the Atlantic and Pacific twice to help people affected by World War ll. Sometime these program can be fun,and sometimes it can show you lessons ,and sometimes you just have to help people that doesn't have a life like you.

In conclusion, this shows why some kids for example Luke went to the Seagoing Cowboys program. These kids went to this program, because it is fun and exciting. This program is an opporunity of a lifetime, it gives you a ton of fun and excitment, and it can help you learn and get better in school, and education.

Do you think the Seagoing Cpwboys program is fun, and would you go to the Seagoing Cowboys program?",3,6,0.7512791156768799
b02a203,"it would be fun to take the pertunity because you get to see new places and new sights and you get to live like a cowboy. for a wile and that would be fun to do if you normaly arent. countryand you get to do new thing such as riding horses and stacking hay.

And it would also be intersting, becaseu you get to new thinks like syack hay ride a horese agian and you get to live driffrent like get up early and you got to feed the, animals and you got to drees diffrent like put on boots so that you dont get muddy.

And there is something eles in valved the war when the war was over they had to give out food becaseu every thing was disrioed so they had to give out food and give out stuff that was needed.

b033285,"Have you ever wondered about what you might do after highscool?

Some people might say college, others might say, just find a well paying job, and others might not even know what they want to do.

Well, if you're one of those ""I don't knowers"", becoming a Seagoing Cowboy might just be the job for you.

Seagoing Cowboys have many great experiences and adventures.

There are many resaons why you should join this program.

One reason why becoming a Seagoing Cowboy might be good for you, is because of the water and animals.

If you find an interest in riding at sea, and you have a love of animals, (like me), this program would be suitable for you.

In paragraph 2 of, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"", it states that it was the end of World War II, so the UNRRA started hiring people to take care of the animals that were being shipped.

Paragraph 5 quotes me, Luke, """"The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says."".

So, if your looking for an amazing and unbelievable opportunity, and animals at sea are your thing, this program would most certainly be for you.

Another reason why this program might be for you, is the joy of helping people.

From previous knowledge, I have learned that many people feel better about themselves when they help someone out.

If this is you, you're the one for the job.

Again, in paragraph 2, it says that it was the end of a World War, and a group was formed to help these countries.

This group, UNRRA was hiring Seagoing Cowboys.

As part of the group, a Seagoing cowboy, not only gets the expiernece of helping someone with their animals, but the life changing experience of helping others in countries that lay in ruins after the war.

Finally, (in my opinion, the best reason of all), you can have fun.

Yes, you heard me right, you an have fun while being a Seagoing Boy.

The article says, in paragraph 7, I, Luke, one night, while on guard, almost died.

Besides the almost dying part (which hurt a lot!), the adventure sounds amazing.

Paragraph 8, even says that,"" Luke also found time to have fun on board.""

It goes on to say that I was able to play volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling when the animals were gone.

Paragraph 5, says that I had a benifit of sight-seeing while being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I even had the oppportunity to go to China, Europe, and Greece.

Thout sounds pretty fun.

If you don't mind work, and love to enjoy yourself, a Seagoing Cowboy is the job for you.

In conclusion, all of these reasons contribute to the fact that you might enjoy the job of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Maybe, one reason calls out to you more than the other, but that's okay.

Besides, we're all in the same boat.

So, if you like fun, animals, and the joy helping people, this is the job for you. All aboard, your future awaits you.",3,6,0.8074229955673218
b040412,"Luke was just about 18, one of his friends asked him if he wanted to go on a trip with him and the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke said ""Yes"". At that moment when he said yes his life was going to change.

When Luke was abord the ship, takeing animals to Europe they had various jobs they had to do, and time flew by and later arived at their destionation. Luke saw some amazing things like the Panama Canal, and the Venice, Italy, he also saw the Acropolis in Greece. If you were to join the Seagoing cowboys than you could see that to. Also Lukes time that he would had served in the military was spent with the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke mad nine trips, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

If you aint interested yet than thats your loss, but if you were to join up with the sea going cowboys than you could sea all those things. Also you could get some great memories with joining up with the Seagoing Cowboys. Lukes storie is a great exsample of what can happen if you can do the right thing for outher people and could make you a better person.

If you want to join than go to any area where they have aplications and sing up and your suvase will start. Also if you want to know were your first shiping is you?l get informed as soon as they get back on your aplication.    ",2,6,0.7899365425109863
b057e26,"I entered a program before called the seagoing cowboys how it all started though was because of my friend don reist. I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

I got to travel a lot to. So here is why I am asking you to join the program just like I did.

I know you probaby won't do it but I am just going to try my best to convince you so the first reason is since the (UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.) That means you would get to help out other countries and their disasters. Another reason you should join is because you get to travel all kinds of places in the world ( Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the acroplis in Greece was special"". he says)which he is actually me. One more reason why is because (luke/I also found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass time.)

So there are 3 reasons that I wrote out of why you should be a seagoing cowboy and if your a girl I suppose you could be a seagoing cowgirl. Now I am not forcing you to but just convincing you and I hope that convinced you because all of it is really true. So if you don't want to that's fine but if you do Great I didn't write all of that for nothing!",2,6,0.8958437442779541
b06624a,"I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It is very fun, who wouldn't want to travel around the world and go to many new places? Who knows? You might meet some nice people and make new friends? I have, I've met people from places I never thought I'd go to before. But I did and here I am. Telling you that if you get on this boat. There is no turning back. But trust me, you wont regret it.

When you go on this trip to many new places. You get to meet new poeple. Now they may not look the same, act the same, or even smell the same. But that doesn't mean that they are any different from us. Most of the people I've met are really nice and caring. They don't talk hateful to you or anything. Even the people on the boat are nice. They have manners, they will respect you and everyone else on the boat.

Now, I've been to many different places before. Nine in fact! The places that you go to are amazing. So many have different languages and different cultures! For example China. Now that place was bueatiful! Somany bright colors. They even have a different language!

I've gotten to see things I've never seen before. Not to brag or anything but of all the places I've ever seen. They all had so many different landmarks. It's kinda like their culture. They all have something different. Which is what is so cool about being on that boat. When you go places you see so many new things. It's amazing!

Now have you made up your mind? If you haven't then I guess that is you loss. But trust me on this one thing. When you get on that boat, you feel free. Something that you don't feel when your stuck in town all the time. But if you decide to go, then good for you. But it isn't all fun in games. You have to work too.

The trip changed Luke's life a lot because he probly would have never thought of hosting to a number of international students, and he even exchanged visitors every year he even met more and more people even after the trip you never know who you could meet.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboy program it would change your life forever a lot of people could have gone to Hawaii and said I saw sea horses, but not a lot of people could say I did the Seagoing Cowboy program and helped lots of people you would have fun make new friends and even new family there is somany reasons you be a Seagoing Cowboy and these are only a few.

Do you want to become a seagoing cowboy? Well I bet your like what's a seagoing cowboy. If you participate to be a

Seagoing Cowboy then you get to explore the world, help others, create memories and get an amazing once in a lifetime oppourtunity.Or you can be like Luke and have a friend convince you or even join with you.

You could be going on vacation but also taking tasks all around the world. For instince say you have to check on the animals every hour, well on your freetime you could be exploring. Being a seagoing Cowboy can be risky but your doing a good deed and at least you tried. In paragraph 7 Luke got hurt but did that stop him from helping? No he jus waited to he was all better and went back at it.

Think about Luke he had two jobs and left to help the UNRRA with Don. Just remember your not choosen to do this you have to have the courage and sign up yourself. Yes , your taking a risk to lose your life, family, and childhood but the animals dont. You have to have patients, time, and love animals. n

I dont know if going to war would be so great, but it would be like serving your country, even if the most that you're doing is taking care of some animals. you still had a part in serving your country and that's all that matters.

I loved caring for the animals. It kept me busy during the crossings. They all had to be fed and watered three times a day. My job also required me to drag the bales of hay and the bags of oats up from the lower holds. I also had to clean the stalls, which isn't as bad as it sounds. I loved taking care of the animals.

You must beware though of what the dangers are of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Once I was making my hourly report to the captain when I slid down a slippery ladder. My heart began to race as I looked down and saw the dark blue sea. I was only saved by a small strip of metal. I would have flown overboard! I mean what would you expect when you are out at see.

Your apart of something that is entertaining you, while your helping others. Your helping nations, communitys, states, and villages. Your helping the world.",3,6,0.6746852397918701

Even though you go on a ship that takes one month to two months it worth the wait getting to the designated area. You can think how many people or animals lives your saving by just becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Imagine going places you never imagined going, like Greece, China. You can also go see places like a excaved castle in Crete even the Panam Canel

Even if the animals have to be fed and watered two to three times a day it's still worth it. You will be tired from pulling bales of hay and bags of oats even stalls had to be clean. There is good things about being a Seagoing Cowboy like when your on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We had tabel tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

I hoped you liked what i said about being a Seagoing Cowboy because i loved being at one. I hope you sign up and become one to, thank you.",3,6,0.867184579372406
b247721,"You know people should really particpate in the Seagoing Cowboys program and here are three resons why. Even though I haven't been there just hear me out.

First of all adventer. I know people have to have adventer in their life.Big adventer or small adventer doesn't matter. But the Seagoing Cowboys program will defintly provide you tons of adventer, you go to different contries meet different people from all over the world.

Second of all you make new friends. If it's on the ship or in different contries friendship is one of the most important things in the world and you will defently will find it in Seagoing Cowboys program.

Last reson is fun. The Seagoing Cowboys program will definlty provide that, you get to traval around the world meet new people and hang out with animals, who would want to miss out on all of that.

Now for concluson I think nobody would be able to put down a offer like this don't you think I wouldn't this would be a trip I be begging to go on those are all the reasons you should go on Seagoing Cowboys program.",2,6,0.7675143480300903
b2c261c,"Some resones to join the program are that you can help people after they have had a hard time. The situation from the text is after World War ll there was alot of destruction in Europe. So Luke went over to Europe to help people get thier lives back. Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all just work you also got to travle the world and see cool places. He said that he and other people on the boat had fun on the way back.

He said that he saw some cool places, and did cool thing, like seeing the Panama Canal or go on a gandola ride in Veince, Italy. Whe the stalls were emty ,he said, that alot of guys on the ship would play games to make the time pass. Some of the games that he had mentoined were baseball, volleyball, table tennis, and many others. They helped pass the time by playing games, is what he said.

I think that he made it sound very appealing to be a Seagoing Cowboy it definetily had it's up's an down's. Like cleaning the stals would be a down, and a up would be playing games. Also being able to go see and do things in other parts of the world.        ",2,6,0.8242095708847046

Have you ever thought about being a Seagoing Cowboy. If you haven't maybe you should. As a Seagoing Cowboy you can help people, animals, and more. Seagoing Cowboys you travel a lot. you travel to places like China, Greece, Europe, and even Venice,Italy. You also take care of animals while shipping. You can feed them and bathe them. There is also lots of sight seeing you get to tour places like excavated castles the Panama canal and more.

In paragraph six Luke had to travel across the Atlantic Ocean for two weeks. He fed and watered the animals two or three times a day. He also had to clean the stalls. He was kept busy on that ship. He was used to being worked all of the tim on his aunt Katie's farm.

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is sometimes dangerous, but fun most of the time. The Seagoing Cowboy program is fun you should try it. ",2,6,0.8656949400901794

You can have a lot of fun on these trips around the world and experience amazing things you have probably never experienced or thought you would experience with your friends and probably your family. On these kinds of trips you will make many memories that you will never want to forget.

On Seagoing events you can do many things that you would want to do or experience that can be very fun. On these kind of trips you have a lot of freetime, in your freetime you can do a variety of things such as table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and many more things that might interest you. On these trips you get to feed animals and maybe sometimes even train them or play games with these animals. You get the experience to explore many rivers and even oceans that might excite you and even get to see some parts of land. You can help a lot of people out on these trips by caring for them by bringing food supplies, animals and many more things that can be helpful to the people and even the enviremont. You also get to experience going on many ships that come in many different sizes.

As you can see there are many good reasons to join the Sea Cowboys and why they are a good program that can help many people and probably even yourself. I hope some day you become a Seagoing Cowboy just like I did and help many people get through hard times that they might be experiencing in their lifetime.

We would have to work hard macking sure the animals where cared for

correctly. They had 335

horses plus enough oats and hay to feesd them. That is a whole lot of horses to take care of see I told you we would have to work very hard. It will aslo keep you busy, infact we barley get to sleep.

Also it takes a long time to cross the Oceon. It takes about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Oceon from the eastern coast to the United states and a month to get to China. Try doing that without getting sleep. It is hard to do all this work.

We do have a little time to have fun onbored. Especially on return trips when the animals have already been unloded. We would play baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animaks had been housed. Table-tennis tournements, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

That is why I think it would be fun joining the seagoing cowboys. WIth all the hard work having to care for the animals. It takes a long time to get there and back so it is lick a very ling vacation. We have time to have fun when the animals have been unloaded.",2,6,0.7297450304031372

The concept of the Seagoing Cowboys it to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. If you join the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Administration) Seagoing Cowboys you will not regret it. You will be having a great time, while helping other people and making new friends on the boat. While I was on my cattle-rides I have visited many places like Venice, Italy, Europe, China, and many other fasinating landscapes. Being on the Seagoing Cowboys also taught me that work can be fun! During free time, you could enjoy a wide variety of activities including table tennis, boxing, fencing, whittling, and many other games.

The years that I participated in the Seagoing Cowboys program were some of the best years of my life. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that no one should pass up on! ",2,6,0.872583270072937
b3912ed,"I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. The progam lets you see sights that you would never see in your life. The program also lets you help people that need food. While you are out on the water you get to relax for a while and get away from loud city noises.

The first reason you should consider signing up is that you get to see beautiful sights in different countries. Going and seeing different countries is something you would never do in your life but, if you sign up you will be able to go and see things that you would only see in pictures. Going to these countries is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

The second reason to sign up is that you get to help people. While your gone you get to help people have a better life. You get to get them cows , chickens ,etc, to help them farm and get better meals. Getting people food saves their life and betters it. It is not as easy as going out to the store and buying food that you need. They have to farm and grow crops to eat. Giving people food that they need gives you a warm fuzzy feeling.

The third reason that you should sign up is that while your on water you get to relax and get away from loud city noises. Getting away from the city for awile is good, you get to figure out how to live away from the city. Also you get to relax and just hear the sound of water hitting the sand.

You could probably get a better night sleep after you hear the water.

I think you should go to the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to see amazing sights , you get to help people, you also get to relax on the water. These are three reasons I think you should sign up. ",3,6,0.7165594100952148

Luke said, ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy he got to see Europe, China and he got to see the Acropolis in Greece."" He got to see so many great sites. Luke toured an excaveted castle in crete and he marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Luke had to travel a lot. But, even though it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United states and a month to get to China. On the long journey

Luke stayed busy by taking care of animals. Taking care of animals and traveling was not all Luke did on the boat, the cowboys played lots of games.

They also did table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and other games to pass time.

The fun part is you get to travel around the world, and visit a variety of places! Wouldn't you like to travel around the world and help countries?

I know I would enjoy being in the program.

Luke Bomberger helped recover food supplies,animals and much more. 44 other nations joined a group called UNRRA. The Seagoing Cowboys were taking care of animals. Luke had made nine trips in1947, it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy! Luke thought it was unbelievable for a small-town boy!

He felt special helping people and animals, an seeing countries. How would you feel? It must have been busy for Luke caring for animals! Taking care of animals is hard work ,imagine taking care of 15 or more!

Would you enjoy taking care of many animals? When Lukewatchman duty and it had been rainy so it was slippery Luke had slipped and fell he had cracked his ribs and couldnt work for a few days. When they unboarded they played many games and sports. Luke was more aware of other countries and needs.

Some jobs I had to do were feeding the cattle, cleaning the stalls, and being night watchman. These may seem a bit tough, but they are worth doing for the outcome. I did these jobs and went on to go on many adventures, like visiting places and meeting new people

""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" I always say. I said this because I enjoyed this job and many people don't just get picked to have an opportunity like this. I feel that if you ever get the chance to go on a cattle boat, you should do it. Sure, there are some dangers over the seas, but sometimes in life you have to take chances. Maybe you are a young boy and you want something to do, this would be the perfect job for you! Do you feel bored or that you have no life... Well here you go! You get to travel the world with this job and work with other people! Does that not sound amazing? Just think, I got to visit China, Europe, Italy, and other plafces too! You will probably be able to visit more than me! If traveling the world and meeting new people is not good enough, I don't know what is.

In conclusion, my point of all of this was to persuade you to to try out the Seagoing Cowboys program and see if you like it. I feel that there are many great results that come after it, and I think that ifr you really put your mind to it, you would enjoy it. Please take into this into consideration and think about the possibilities of your future.

All people deserve the same right. luke got injured and he had to rest for a couple days but he stil went on to finish the mission. He didn't even have an idea that his life was gonna change he just took the chance when it was offered and he never doubted it.

After the war he joined the UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Luke was only 18 when all of this happened. He helped out at his aunt Katie's ranch for most of his days when he was just a little boy. He helped with the enviorment and cattle and other animals at the places where ww2 took place. Alot of people died but not in his hands.

Brave people survived and never forgot the memory of ww2. Luke being a Seagoing cowboy was the thing that he was most proud of.

Luke worked two part-time jobs, so you can tell that he is hard working. Then his friend Don Reist gave him the opportunity of a life-time. To be a Seagoing Cowboy.

The Seagoing Cowboy program is where people go around the world on a boat to help people and animals. After World WarII, it was a great opportunity to go and help people and animals from other continents recover from this catastrophe. Reasons to become a seagoing Cowboy is, you get to help people and animals in need of assistance. Helping people is a good thing to do and it makes you feel good and the people you help feel good too. You also get to explore all of the exotic, unique places around the world when you are traveling. Those reasons are few of many.

""Seagoing Cowboys, to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up."" paragraph 2. Luke and Don felt a need to help and put their time and effort to help these people and animals.

Even though Luke and Don care for people and love animals, some people wouldn't take the opportunity. Most people love animals and helping people, but some just don't like animals or they are too selfish to tak some time to go around the world and help other people with things that you already have and they don't. Or people get seasick or are just too paranoid to go on a boat because they think it is going to sink.

Besides, the portion that has most people who would do something like Luke and Don, are people around us and we will always have those kind of people.

To Luke, his life changed after this wonderful experience. His adventures opened up the world for him. ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awresess stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.""

I seemed to arrive in the places just as the wars were ending so it was good timing. I told people that it was a really good experience and I enjoyed my trip. I went to New Orleans,Greece,Italy,and China on my adventures of being a seagoing cowboy. I would really suggest being a seagoing cowboy expecially if you are someone who wants to travel or enjoys traveling. My argument to go is this could be a once ina lifetime offer like it was for me. If you get the oppurtunity i would really take. I know if i got offered again I would take it it's a really amazing way to see the world and experience other cultures.

It is always a good oppurtunity to experience new cultures and learn new things. You never know what you are going to like. Like some peole you might even end up living in another country because you enjoy their culture so much. There are also other things cultures have that you might like to try like foods and different ways of living. Many cultures have different lifestyles that you might like.

I really hope this convinced you to go ahead and go on the trip. This could be one more thing that you miss out on because you weren't willing to take a chance and experience new cultures.

My first reason on why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it can help out people in need.""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" That is one example that the program lets us help, not only just the people but also the animals too. I also found ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them."" That is one reason why people should join this program.

Another reason people should join this program is because you get to go new places in the world, for example I went to Greece! ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Also another piece of evidence is ""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy; a city with streets of water."" This is another example of why new people should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

An example is because it is a great opportunity for people. You get to do so many new things with new people. "" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger."" Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an eye opening experience for me. I also found in the text is states

""It opened the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says."" This program is a great experience and adventure. I know I couldn't pass down the opportunity once it was handed to me. The article says ""Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.""

These are just a couple reasons why I think people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It can help others and animals.

Luke had the longest year than any seagoing cowboy. He traveled for 9 years dilivering animal across the world. he saw many sight in his travels like the acropolis in greece.

There are many reasons to be one, you get to help countries recover animals and supplies, you get to see different countries and their most interesting places, and you get to have fun on the trips too.

One of my first reasons is that you get to help countries recover animals and supplies and help their people. It was an extremely great honor to help the countries that were affected by World War II. It also opened up the world to me, it made me more aware of other countries and their needs. If you join then you would feel like a better person because you would know that you helped multiple countries recover from a giant war that affected many people.

Including helping countries, you get to sightsee and explore them as well. From what I saw, every country has many beautiful and wonderful places to explore and see. I've seen many places in different countries such as, a castle in Crete, the Panama Canal on my way to China, and I've even taken a gondola ride in Venice, Itay. I got to see these many places just by signing up in this program. That is another reason why you should participate in being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Finally, on the return trips after the animals have been unloaded, there are games that we play in the empty holds where the animals have been housed. So if you think that this job would be tireing and no fun you're wrong. We played many fun and competitive games on board such as baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. Even with an exhausting job you still have a great opportunity to have fun while still helping many countires.

If I hadn't of joined the program I would have had to stay where I lived and would've never seen the places such as China, the Panama Canal, Italy, Europe, and Acropolis.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy, I was able to see the other side of the story from people on the other side of the world. When I lived in America, al So, I joined in on the Seagoing Cowboy program, thinking that just maybe, I would be able to make a difference in this world. Having prior knowledge about what exactly ""hard work""

I was able to get many things accomplished that other people in that program that normally people wouldn't be able to do. Besides just helping devastated people with their homes destroyed from the battles of World War two, I was also able to have unique adventures to places that you don't typically go to everyday. Besides from that, when I was on my second year of being a Seagoing Cowboy, I was serving as night watchman. I was making my hourly reports to check on the animals every hour when I had slipped on the ladder and I went feet first towards an opening on the side of the ship. Luckily, a strip of metal along the edge of the boat had caught my fall and kept me from flying over the edge into the dark Atlantic ocean. Altough I had a few cracked ribs from the inccedent, I was able to find some sort of fun to do while I was waiting for the animals to be unloaded. All of the cowboys decided to get together and play baseball and volleyball in the empty stalls where the animals had been. We also found games to do like table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and game helped us pass time. Not only that, but being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than just an adventure for me. It opened up a whole new world for me. I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Being able to see this, I was able to recruit many international students and exchange visitors for years, and maybe, you will too.

With some background knowledge and determination, eventually you will be able to become a Seagoing Cowboy too.",3,6,0.8076000213623047

I help on my aunts Katie's farm as a boy ,and it had prepared me for hard work. On the ship you had to do a lot of things .Like:water the animals,feed the animals. They had to clean the animals stals. It might sound bad,but it's not .It might seem boring as a brick ,but I promis it isnt.

Luke had watch duty when he was coming back from talking to the captian he sliped on the ladder on his back side. That had to hurt. He had broke his ribs. He about fell over borad in the dark Alantic Ocean. He found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Some of their games they played were baseball and vollyball. They also played :tabel tennis ,fencing,boxing,and more.

""Seagoing Cowboy"". I said yes beacuse it was a ""once in a life time opportunity"". When I first became a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" the year was 1945.

When I turned 18 I had enlisted in the army. On the ship we had to work hard day and night, we had to care for the animals during the crossings, We had to lift the heavy bags of oats and hay. We also had to water the animals two or three times a day. It was hard but it was helpful to me. When I was discharged in 1947 I had made 9 trips that is more then anyone else. But I had some good times on the ship as a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". After we would drop all of the animals off where they were needed we would play game in their stals like, Base Ball, Volleyball,Table-Tennis,Boxing,fencing,and Whittling.

But in the end all of that hard work and time was worth it. I was able to go to so many places!

I went to

Greece to see the Acropolis. I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I took a ride in a gondola in Venice, Itally, with streets of water.

The Seagoing Cowboys are helpfull for countries in need. Luke and Ron helped out countries that were destroyed by World War Two. They did that by dilivering animals to the destroyed places. If they didn't do that a lot of people might have died. Thats why peaple should join.

They could have a chance to become heros and save lives in countries in need. Also peole can have the advantage to see cool sights. Luke and Ron went to Acropolises in Greece, and went to a castle in Crete.

They also looked at the Panama Canal on their way to China. Becoming a Sea Cowboy gives you the chance to go around the world. Being a Sea Cowbay isn't a dangarous job either. Luke only endered one injury on the job from what the story said.

There's also a chance to have fun on board. When Luke went on return trips all the animals were unloaded. The crew was able to play games like table tennis, fencing, and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than going on an adventure. It opens up the world for people who have never been to a lot of places. Luke was very gratefull for the opportunity to be a Sea Cowboy. It makes people more aware of the things that need to be stopped in the world. The awarness stays with you to. Luke went on to host a lot of international students and exchange visitors for the next coming years.

After the last paragraphs it makes it pretty obvious to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It makes a lot of good becoming one also. There is also new experiences to be made to. So if there's nothing working out for you maybe becoming a Seagoing Cowboy will fit yourself and give you a chance.",3,6,0.8817828297615051
b80959a,"Why should you join the Seagoing Cowboys program? Well, there are many reasons. Firstly, you have many chances of adventure. Who knows what could happen, but it could be worth the risk. Another reason you should consider being apart of the great program is the exprience. This could be a once in a lifetime offer that may never apear again. Furthermore, the learning oppurtunities are endless, and maybe even fun.

The places you could go. It almost seems like a dream when thinking about the many chances and oppurtunities that may stand with an open door. You could meet some great, new people. See some great new places. Luke stated from the passage ,""Besides helping people, I has the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" You have the life-changing chance to not only help the needy, but to see things some don't have the chance to. Not only see, but exprience.

Expriencing new things can be terryifying, but can be something incredible as well. You can visit museums, ride bikes through the city, dine at the fanciest restaraunts with some new-found friends. Not only can you do all of those things, you can become close with the animals and other workers while on the journey. You may be busy throughout, but think of the job you are doing for so many in need, It's all worth the work. Expriencing is also learning.

Learning new things is like having money in your pocket. You may need all that you learn one day, and you need to be prepared for whatever life throws at you. One of the many things for you to learn while being a Seagoing Cowboy is how to care for animals. Animals have needs like humans. They need food, water and sometimes shelter to survive life's harsh ways. Another thing you may need to learn is how to communicate in other languages, or maybe how to speak in that language. You may also need to learn how to cook different foods, or how to live in harsher conditions like some do in other countries. The possibilities are endless whe it comes to learning new things, sometimes they are as simple as doing the dishes. But we can agree that there is more fun things to do rather than doing the dishes.

Stated in paragraph 8, ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, esprecially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and vollyeball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading and games also helped pass the time."" Finding ways to entertain yourself doesn't seem to be hard when you have many crew members who would eargerly accecpt the oppurtunity to play a good game of catch.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy seems to be a great oppurtunity for many to exprience. The many fun activites, the great cultures, the amazing people, and new things to learn should be enough to convince someone to become a Seagoing Cowboy and do some outstanding things for those in need.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy will allow you to to experience adventure. And when you experience something for the first time it can be scary and it can be really fun. Also you can visit unique places that some people will never get to go to. And when you go to those places you can tell really good storys. I remember when my family went to Flordia for the first time together and when I got back I had a lot to write about.

By doing something new it could change your future and you might realize you like doing this in sted of doing what you had planed. But you have to want to try something new and you have to give it a chance. When you try something for the first time it might not always work out but most of the time when you keep trying and not give up it will end up going really well and you could learn to like it.

But if you look at it at a diffrent way going into the sea is dangerous and you would have to be really careful. And if you where in a storm you would have to be careful not to tip the boat and you have to remember there would be cattle on the boat. Also you would have to be careful around the animals so they wont bite or try to kick you.

However it can change your life by seeing new things. And you would get to see unique places that a lot of people can't go. You will get to experience adventure and be able to tell great storys about where you where and what you did there. So therefore i think everybody should try something new and be a Seagoing Cowboy.",4,6,0.7800807952880859
b95f77e,"Many people have joined the Seagoing Cowboys lately. Mostly because of the feeling you get when you get to help someone out. World war II has left many Eurepean citys in shambles and with-out the needed suplies. I am here today to list the good and bad facts about this job.

First of all my time at the job was amazing, fun, and not all work. On your trip there you watch horses, mules, and/or cows. That only consist of cleaning pens, feeding, watering, grooming, and exersizing. On your way back you get to see many epic sights and amazing views. You also can relax and play games like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to help pass the time.

Now a bad thing to show you, so you can see its now all fun and games. Once I was night-gaurd and it was raining I slipped and fell feet first down a hole I landed with only a metal rail to stop me from plunging deep into the great unknown.

That feeling of acomplishment is the best feeling ever. Imagine this. When you get there you see hunger people surviving with the clothes on their back and food from the rubble of houses. They smile and you see many kids watch from still standing houses and you smile back as they help to unload the cattle.

Little things do help. There are many little things you can do to help out with this. Things as simple as recycling or not wasting food, its hard to eprectiate what you have untill you see others that have lost it all. I have I've seen people who have been happy and far then lost it all because of war.

I've made eight trips so far and am incuraging you to come helpout with this uphill battle. I hope that I've shown you how important it is to help others, because I have found out that it only takes a simple deed and your on the right track. I hope you will join the Seagoing Cowboys soon.

Even though he got hungry and tired he didn't quit. He discovered unique places in the world and meet other people.

Luke helped people that are in the war and people that does'nt have food, water, and shelter. He would want other men to join the war because it made him feel good about hiself because he repected his country. Luke didn't even think if he wants to be a a military he just said yes because he knew that it would be a oppurtunity of a lifetime.

I think that people should join war, so that we could have our freedom by getting it ourselves, by fighting in war and being courageous like Luke. Luke can inspire people and wanting themselves to join the military. Most military says that ""We die with honor"".    ",1,6,0.41188350319862366

By

the time he was discharged in 1947 Luke had made nine trips which was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy Luke had fun when the animals were releasted out of their cage the cowboys also played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed

thoses games also helped time go by.

Sea Cowboys were much more than a trip to Luke Bomberger it oped up the world it helped other countries and their needs and to help them survive and to stay healthy

and to have a good life and good choices.

That stayed with Luke Bomberger and it led him to leading a number of internalional students and exchange visitors for many years.

Another reasons why I think you should become a seagoing cowboy is because you are helping people. In paragraph 2 it says ""UNRRA hired 'Seagoing Cowboys' to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" This program helped people that are depending on livestock get what they need over seas.

My last reason why I think you should become a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" is that we have a lot of fun on board.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

What you need to know about how to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that you should join it because I love it, I love working with the animals; I have a feeling you would too. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity, you can't pass it up. You will also get to go sightseeing in a lot of cool, different places.

These are some reasons why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Here are some reasons why I took the job; and why I think you would like it.

When I first got out of highschool, I did not think that I would be working two part-time jobs. Or be so busy all of the sudden, the jobs were so boring, it was time for a change.

Then my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Eurpoe on a cattle boat. I couldn't deny it; this was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

I think that you will love the experince with the animals and nature.

But this job can also be very dangerous, I cracked my ribs and couldn't work for a couple of weeks because I fell off a slippery ladder.

You might need a love for animals and nature, and experince with working on a farm; but you also need to be very brave and be ready for anything that comes your way.

These are plenty of reasons why I think that you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. There are also reasons why I became a Seagoing Cowboy and what you need to know to be one. Please take my advice and try out the program. I think you will love being able to see cool stuff in different countries and working with the animals.

For example, you get to go on many trips around the world and go to places such as Europe and China and much more places. Another benefit is helping people and taking care of animals. My final reason is that it helps you be more aware of people in different countries and their ways of living and it's fun.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy gives you the chance to visit many places. I got to go to Europe and China. Seeing Acropolis was special. So was taking a a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with water for streets. I also toured an castle in crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Me and the other Seagoing Cowboys also crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States to get to China.

The other benefit was helping people and taking care of animals. Caring for the animals kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. On my second trip, I served as night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour. We had to help people in other countrys by recovering their food suplies, animals, and other needs.

The final benefit was that it helps you be more aware of people in different countrys and their needs. The opportunity made me more aware of how the people in different countrys lived and how they dont have their needs and how i was helping them with their needs. Being a Seagooiing Cowboy also is fun. On return trips we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had stayed. Table-tennis tournaments, boxing,fencing,reading,whittling, and games were fun ways to pass the time.

In conclusion i think you shouold be a Seagoing Cowboy becuase it has many benefits. The benfits are you got to visit many places and tour many places. The other benfit was that you got to help people and take care of animals. The final benefit was that being a Seagoing Cowboy made you more aware of people in different countrys and their ways of living and it is fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun because you can play games and time will fly when your having fun. You can be the one to take care of helpless animals and feed and water then as well. That is why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy.  ",2,6,0.7538918852806091
bc9b957,"One ordinary day my friend Don Reist invited me to be a Seagoing Cowboy in Europe. I couldn't say no to that getting to help people and getting an opportunity of a life time. While over there I realized how bad those countries are and how many Seagoing Cowboys they really need. For me the answer was an immediate yes, because there's so many reasons to be in the Seagoing Cowboy's Program.

While I was on the cattle boat trips I got to see Europe and China. Not only that but I got to see the Acropolis in Greece which was so amazing to see and probably my favorite. A gondola ride in Venice, Italy with the city streets made of water. I also had the opportunity to tour a castle in Crete, and saw the beautiful Pana Canal on my way to China. All this beautiful sightseeing is only one of my reasons.

I didn't just go over there for that, I went over there to help. Yes, all those magnificent sights were a blast to see. Yet as an affect of World War ll, there were people with out homes who needed help and food. As a small town boy I only got to have few choices of work, but as a Seagoing Cowboy I went everywhere and got to help people. We helped them by shipping horses, mules, and young cows overseas because they had lost all there animals. While helping I got to sail across the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice. Knowing everytime I sailed across either ocean I was helping someone in need. Which made me feel good and not so much like a small town boy anymore. Lots of Seagoing Cowboys are needed and as you can conclude there are many great reasons to join.   ",4,6,0.802496075630188

I went to Europe,China,Venice,and Greece.In Greece I saw the Acropolis.I got to ride a gondola in Venice,Italy.I also toured an excavated castle in Crete,and marveled the Panama Canal on my way to China.When we left the animals in places, we could play baseball and voleyball in the empty holds.We also did tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading and,whittling.

Caring for the animals kept me busy.I had to feed and water them two or three times a day.Bales of hay and oats had to be brought up from the bottom of the ship.We also had to clean the stalls.

As you can see I had a great time.Helping and having fun was someting I did.It was an opportunity of a lifetime.So,you might consider joining the program.You can go sightseeing and help.You may see places you always wanted to see.Helping other people is amazing.You'll be able to have fun once the job is done.

I had a great deal of fun on my trip. It gave me an opportunity to see many countries that I may not have seen on any other basis, such as Venice, Italy as well as parts of China, Europe, and Greece. I also chose to spend my off time playing sports and games whenever the chance came along. Your down time; however, would be entirely up to you though, but these are some unique places and things to consider exploring.

My down time was not the most important part of the trip though. It also gave me an opportuntiy to aid others as well as animals, who's homes where left in ruins. After getting this chance to so something more in my life, I knew that this was a great thing that I had invested my time into.

Extensively, I would recomend this as a career path to any who are interested. The years that I was a Seagoing Cowboy, were a great few years in my life.

Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. ""So i was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

One reason why you should join is you get to help people. The Seagoing Cowboys take care of animals that are shipped overseas to other countries because during the war many people lost their animals. You see, when World War 2 ended many nations formed an organization called UNRRA who hired the Seagoing Cowboys to perform this task.

Another reason you should join is you get see many places and sometimes you get to explore them. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. I also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete and I got to marvel at the Panama Canal which was an incredible experience.

The final reason I will use to convince you is it can be very fun. On the return trip we Seagoing Cowboys would play many games where the animals had been held. We played baseball,volleyball,and many other games.

I know that this is a big choice and that giving you a few reasons will not convince you right-off-the-bat but hopefully what I have said has planted seeds in your mind that will eventually grow and in time you will come around.

People can have fun have go on lot's of adventures and see lot's of unique places.

Seagoing cowboys get to go to a lot of different and unique places by boat. Luke said he traveled to Europe, China, And he got to see the Acropolis in Greece. In the article he said that the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Luke took a tour of an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on is way to China. The author of The Cowboy Who Rode the Waves stated that Luke went to Crete to visit and tour the castle and marveled at the Panama canal on his way to China.

While on his way to China Luke cared for the animals to keep him busy.

The author wrote in the article that Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

Luke fed and watered them at least three times a day. A seagoing Cowboy has to get hay and oats from the bottom deck of the ship and stalls had to be cleaned.

They can also play fencing, boxing, read, whittling, and games to pass time.

bd6f060,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an amazing thing to do. You get to do all kinds of stuff on the sea. You get to do stuff you don't even think of doing. Here are some reasons why I think you should join us and become a Seagoing Cowboy.

One of my reasons why I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is because you get to have so much fun on the boat or other places you stop. You get to help animals, find new people, and when you drop the animals off at the location, you can even play games in the stalls where they were held. Another fun thing you get to do while being a Seagoing Cowboy is going over-seas. Going over-seas is an awesome experience. I crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice.

The second reason I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is, because of the sightseeing. When you see those amazing sculptures or ruins of what you know what they were, you can take pictures in your head and tell people stories of what yoiu saw. A couple of the sights that I got to see were, the Acropolis in Greece, I got to see China, and I also got to see Europe. Seeing these things changed my life completely.

My last but certainly not least reason is that you get to be with animals the whole ride. Sure they ""cost"" some responsibility but they can be fun to play with. Animals are amazing creatures and getting to spend along time with them will make you never wanna let go. When you're on the ship, and you're heading to your destination, you can sometimes get lonesome. But don't forget you have animals to keep you not bored and get your responsibility up.

Seagoing Cowboys are amazing jobs that you can do. Even if you don't like adventures this is still an amazing job. People need more adventures so if you're olne of those peopled, join the Seagoing Cowboys program.",4,6,0.8183334469795227

But, one night it was very stormy and I slipped and hit the side of the boat and broke many ribs. Which stopped me for doing anything for the next couple of days.

But, there were other fun things to see and to do accros the sea. Like baseball and volleyball because when the ship was unloaded there was alot of free space. Also, when you were shipping things you got to see alot of cool and exiting places.

Luke got to explore the world, also found time to have fun aboard after they got all the animals out, they played stuff like Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and those games helped pass the time.

In 1945 Luke was offered to go to Europe with his friend Don and he knew that this was an oppertunity of a lifetime. When he got there he signed up for ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of people and animals. Luke thinks that it was the best experience of his life and that it would be to you to.

According to the text, Luke stated that on his trips he was on a cattle-boat and that it was an amazing experience for him. The text also states that besides him helping people he got to oversee Europe and China, and if you joined you would get to see even more. Luke also got to tour a excavated castle in Crete, so if you went you would probably see something even better.

The text also stated that joining the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" you get to care for animals during the crossings and you had to feed them and give them water to keep you busy. Also going to join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" you have to be prepared for dangers at sea, because if your not you might have something horribly happen to you because you might get the nightwatch job and have to check things and make sure everythings okay and might fall or slip in the process.

Also, when the trips were over you were able to relax or play games while the animals had been housed for a little. Also it opens up a world to people and it makes you more aware of others in different countries in need. It also makes you feel like you accomlished something that makes you feel grateful that you got this oppertunity to make others and yourself feel loved.

In conclusion, if you join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" like Luke did then you might bring joy to people's life and to yours.

For one Bomberger had a blast traveling to many different places, it says in paragraph 5 he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled the panama canal on his way to China .Crazy amazing, right? He was admiring one place on his way to another. What a lucky guy.

Another thing is Bomberger Got to go places that many people may never go. For example He had been to China, Eastern coast of the US, and Europe. Way farther out of North America then Ill ever be. He was probably millions of miles away from where his comfort zone (his house).

Also just the over-all experience you get when you do or try something new. Bomberger states in paragraph 9 that being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun of an adventure. Its all about the people you share the moment with also, they could make it adventerious, scary, fun, or sad.

They could also see alot of places like Eruope and China. They also saw the acropolis in Greece but caring for the animals kept luke busy for a while. They had to be feed and water 2 to 3 times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned to so they needed help.

The program was a great way to help the people and the animals. We probably wouldnt have as many animals if the seagiong cowboys didnt help. Thats why they need you to join. Its very benificial and you can see places you have never seen before its also a great way to make friends since youre stuck on a ship for days you can get to now them just like luke and don.

In paragraph 5,6,7,8 you can see why luke joined. He tryed something new and liked it . He had a fun time seeing all the places and helping the animals .

In the story it tells about a boy who signs up with his friend to be in a cattle boat job in the passage it said "" The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys to take care of cows,horses,mules,and more over seas. Luke and Don signed up for the job."" Luke got to go all around the earth and deliver cattle. Lukes job on the boat was to check the cattle every hour.

Luke got to go all around the world and see amazing places they had allot of free time so they visited many places. Luke visited greece luke got to see the Acropolis. They saw China,Europe,Italy,and more. Luke got to stay in these places and got to see many things. Luke liked the job working as cattle delivers.

In conclusion Luke had allot of fun and Luke got to see allot of things in other countrys. I think it was a good story. At the end of the story Luke says ""I'm grateful for the opprotunity. It mad me aware of people in other countrys."" I hope that you saw Lukes point of view and it convinced you to be in the Seagoing Coyboy in the program. ",2,6,0.7118229269981384
beae3b7,"Luke was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. When his friend Don asked him to go on a cattle boat Luke couldn't say no. It was and opportunity of a life time and Luke knew it. In 1945 the World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins.44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Rlief and Rehabilition Administration).They hired seagoing cowboys to take care of all the animals. So Luke and Don signed up.

In August 1945,they received an order to go to New Orleans. They arrived on the 14th of August the day the pacific war ended says Luke. They got there papers and got a boat called the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed towards Greece. They were delivering 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. Be for they got to Greece Luke turned 18 years old. That ment that he could be drafed at any time to go to war. When he told them that he was on a cattle-boatr trip they told him to do it for the Military Service. Luke had made nine trips that more then any seagoing cow boy has ever made.

The cattle boat trip was an alsome trip for a small town boy Luke say. besides helping people he also got to see different countries like all of Europe and China but when he saw Acropolis in Greece it was special to him Luke says. It toke Luke and Don abount two weeks to crose the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast that is a long time on water non stop that would make me sick and never ride a boat again but sometimes you have to do things you dont want to do.

When Luke was little he helped his aunt Katie's farm ou when he was a boy and he has worked hard ever since that is my dream is to work on a farm. It did not teach him the dangers of the sea though. When he was on his secened trip he was a night watchman. He had to check on all of the animals every hour and that was easy i bet because of him helping on a farm when he was a kid that was the same but it was on a boat. When he was reporting to the captin one time he slipoed and fell on the ground and a peice of meatal stop him from going over board.

So that was my eassy on Luke and his life I really liked this story alot i would have wrote more but i am about out of time so thats all i got. I found out that that peice of meatal craked his ribs so he could not work for a acouple of days witch that might of hert his body every day till it was helled but i do nt know because i am not Luke and that is the end of my story.

bed3294,"There are many different topics and reasons about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy but i'm not goning to mention them all if I did it would take me an excrutiateingly long time. So in cunclusion I am onley going to mention a few of them such as importance, adventure, and sites.

The importians of the Seagoing Cowboys was an extremley important person to be in that time period for saveing hundreds of thousands of cattle, hoarses and any kind of lifestock that was useful to the people. No matter how stormy it got they always tryed there best to keep on cource and never give up. They worked very hard cleaning stalls, feeding the animals, and giving them waterThey were always honored then and I think we should honor them now as well or better as they did back in the time of world war Two.

Oh and just imagian the adventure they had out on the open sea just having the time of there lives. They probably ran in to some nasty storms just think of the waves probabley huge waves the size of a mountain. In the story Luke almost whent flying off the shp but he got lucky he caught a peice of metal to hold onto. Cuold youjust imagian how much that would scare you, if you would have been swallowed by the hungery ocean. They could have even been flung overboard and eaten by sharks it just gives me the chilles thinking about it.

Oh just thnk of the sites they have seen they have probabley been all around the world. In the story it said that Luke he whent to Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. That was only one he even whent down the Panama Canal on his way to China! can you imagian dong somthing like that !? It would be spectaculer seeing those kind of sites. He even whent on a tour threw an excuvated castle now that is like the cherry on a sundae don't you agree?

That is why I think past Seabearing Cowboys shoul be honored for there services and not just ignored like they are today. My goal is to get the word out about the Seabearing Cowboys to show there importance to this country. So they arent just forgoten and cast away and not honored.   ",4,6,0.814976692199707

Luke did not know his life would change soon. It was 1945, World War ll was over in Europe, and many counties were left in the ruins. UNRRA hired "" Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that wereshipped over seas. It says that Luke and Don signed up.

He crossed the Antlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War ll. Luke also found time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

Luke said "" It made more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Then awareness stayed with him. The cowboys played beseball and volleyball games on board when Luke was on. There was plenty of games they played on board.

Helping at his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him is what the paragrph said so what it is saying is when he was little then he went to his aunt Katie's farm and played around and it helped him with his future with animals.        ",1,6,0.6994431018829346

One reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is, you can see many different sites.

In paragraph 5 it states ""I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canel on my way to China."" Showing you can see many different sites. While being aboard a ship, seeing something unforgettable is one of the best things you can possibly even image to see.

Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is, you can be saving a person's life. You being a Seagoing Cowboy can help a family in need of milk from a cow, or a goat for cheese. You taking care of those animals can be a last hope for a family's breakfast/Lunch/Dinner. You could also be possibly be saving other animals, not just the animals you are saving, but animals at a family's house. They might have a dog that hunts, and you could be saving the dog for the family as well. So you can join and save a life, putting yours before theirs.

A last reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is that you can meet new people. In paragraph 8 it says that the after returns on trips the cowboys would stay and play games like Baseball, Volleyball, boxing. All with those games you can meet new people. You can find someone like you because trust me, you will find someone like you. You can find a bestfriend and do what you like doing with a best friend.

When i was seventeen and i joined the program. I did it for my country but then i found out that i can get pleasure from it too you get to take care of animals but if you are like me and used to taking care of animals you wont care about that.

You should join the Seagoing Coboys program because you can see amazing things if you read the biography then you know that in paragraph 5 I saw an exavated castle in Crete on my way to China. You dont just sit there taking care of horses and other farm animals you also get to play games. I do other things too if you read paragraph 8 of the biography about me then you know that us cowboys found time to have fun on board. W e played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds. Sometimes we even played table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling and other games too.

Im not saying thats its all fun and games because its not. One time I even broke my ribs while on the boat as you can see in paragraph 7. Boats will tip over,sink or they might even rock. That still doesnt stop you from atleast trying to make a difference. You can still make a difference for people.

In conclusion being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than adventure it also opened up the world for me. You can also help other countries out that are doing worst than you or that are not doing good at all. As you can see in paragraph 9 that I am grateful for my opportunity to be a Seagoing Cowboy. By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs and because of that awareness my family hosted a number of international students and echange visitors for many years as you can see in paragraph 9 of my biography.

What is a ""Seagoing Cowboy"", you ask?

It is a member of United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA.)

Our job is to keep an eye on the cows and horses that go overseas.

If you ever get a chance to become a Seagoing Cowboy, trust me, you will NOT want to miss it.

One of the reasons I enjoyed being a member of UNRRA so much is that it gave me a chance to build friendships and communities with other countries.

I think that is a very important thing to have because without that bond, you might beome enemies and go to war.

Another thing that I enjoyed was just life as a Seagoing Cowbiy in general!

For starters, I LOVE farm animals so I had no problem with watching a bunch of cows and horses all day.

Not to mention that the scenery is absoloutly gorgous!

I got to see plenty of astounding sights such as the Panama Canal and the Acropolis in Greece.

In conclusion, being a member of UNRRA is and oppertunity you don't want to miss.

You get to spend time with animals, see epic scenery, and most importantly, build a bond with other communites.

Another reason to join is because you can see a lot of exiting places because we sometimes have ""free time"". You can just stop by and take a look at it.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected bt World War 2.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He know it was an opportunity of a lifetime. He had to go. It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recovert their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

Here are some reasons you should join Seagoing Cowboys program. The first reason is that you could travel around the world if you like to travel. The second reson is that you would get to take care of animals, such as cow, horses, and even mules! How cool is that. The third reason is that you can play games!

c18f44f,"Have you ever wished you could help your nation, well I have a thing that you can do. I'm Luke, and i'm a Seagoing ""Cowboy"". Don't think that it's nasty to be a Seagoing ""Cowboy"", you get to do amazing stuff.

On the ship you get to take care of lots of animals, they're really fun to hang-out with. You get to take care of them for a living, how cool is that. Plus your helping your nation while your doing it.

There is also lots of time to sight-see the places you go. I toured a excavated castle in Crete, and was marvled when I saw the Panama Canal. All of it was really cool, but I only got to see it when I was a Seagoing ""Cowboy"".

You also get to do really fun stuff when the animals are deilvered. We played baseball, and had volleyball turnoments in empty stalls, Where the animals used to stay. We also had ping-pong and lots of other games we had fun with.

You also have different jobs like night-guard. I remember when i was on night-guard for the first time. Had some great adventures. My first night i was on the job, I broke a rib, be careful on slippery ladderes, very careful.

Being a Seagoing ""Cowboy"" is all fun and games, it's seirous busniess. You have to give the animals water 3-4 times a day. You have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats from lower holds of the ship.

You also want to be confident in yourself. If you say you can't do, Then you probley won't do it. Plus can't never did anything, but could tried because he could do it.          ",3,6,0.7563254833221436
c192588,"So this is what i think about why you should help the seagoing cowboys. Also why you should sign up.

I think you should join them because they helped people that lost everything from World War II. They would sail to Europe in cattle boats so they could give cattle, and meat to everyone that was devastated by the war. They also got to see alot. You got to sail past alot of places so you could see the great wall of china and all those tuorist attractions. They also got to help people like charity or like helping at a senior home if you are in to that stuff then you should sign up.

In the story it menchaned how they got to see so many diffrent countries. So you would have alot of fun. You could see many tourist attractions like the Great Wall Of China, and thats onlly one think of all the others. You also got to play games on the boat so you wernt always board. There was alot you could do. You also had alot of freedom.

Last but not least the goodness about it. This job would put happieness in your heart because when you bring the cattle, and food you are helping the homeless and the poor. Those people that got everything tooken away your there refuge and to me that would make me happy. So being kind putting other in front of you so they are happy is a good deed.

I think thats why you shoudl join so you can help the people that need saving, and also you get to see stuff you might never get to see again.",3,6,0.8238363265991211

When World War II was over in Europe, many places and countries were destroyed. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can help these places and countries regain what they lost like their food supplies, animals, and a lot more.

This program visits many places that were ruined during the war and one of those places is Greece. If you are 18 and wish to be drafted for military service, this is an amazing opportunity to do so. You can help your service if you join this program because you are helping already by shipping animals to where they belong.

Besides helping people, you are also allowed to experience adventures and visit many unique places. These trips are an unbelieveable opportunity for small-town people. You get the benefit to visit China, Europe, Greece, Italy,and many other places. Seeing the Acropolis, an excavated castle in Crete, the Panama Canal, and taking gondola rides are also other benefits of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is much more than a adventure and it might open up the world to you and many others.

Well you might want to become a ""Cowboy"" who ""Rides the Waves.""

My name is Luke and I'm here to tell you why you should become a ""Wave-rider""

I think you should become a cowboy who rides the waves because you get to help different people in different countries.

You get to have a little experience going on your record.

When you become a cowboy you feel a sense of civic participation and recognition for what you are doing.

Here at UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) we dedicate our lives to helping people.

Here's the benifit of why you should join, you get to go on daily trips to distant countries and meet new people. Evidence from the text that supports my claim is, "" 'Besides helping people, I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,' he says.

'So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.'

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china.""

You can also do fun things on the ship that you are on while you are sailing.

Some things that you can do on the ship are, baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the games also helped pass time.

Information from the text that supports my answer is, ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.""

c252897,"Seagoing Cowboys Program is a program, where you take care of horses, calfs (young cows), and mules, that were shipped over sea. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to travel to a lot of unquine countries around the world. Luke Bomberger was a Seagoing Cowboy and, by the time it was 1947 he made nine trips. Luke's second trip was that he had to serve as a night watchman, who checks on the animals every hour.

We know now that, not everyone would like to be a Seagoing Cowboy, but while you are traveling, there are many new countries you could explore and learn about. It does take a long time to get to other countries, it would take about two weeks because they have to travel in boat, if your going by sea. It would be a tedious amount of time to get to place to place and nobody likes a tedious task. Luke had to make sure that he didn't forget to feed the animals because,you have to feed them two or three times a day. They had to get loads of bales of hay and bags of oats from other ships that transfer the food to him, and you would have to clean the stalls. Some don't about joining this program is that, when you are traveling you, may get stuck in some storms and really hurtful storms too.

Although, there is a lot of traveling, it maybe worth the work because, you got to see new countrires and new landscapes. Luke Bombgerger worked hard and he loved seeing all the new cities and countries, but struggles traveling. There is many up and downs about joining the program, literally, because not everyone likes traveling, but a lot of people do. Now we have airplanes so, if you travel it will be easier for you to get to other countries.

c25a8dc,"The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" Program.

Luke's participation in the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program allows him to experience adventures and visit many unique places. I think many of you should join this program. Here are my reasons why you should join this program: you can save someone,you get a nice experience by traveling to different countries, and when your done doing your job you can hangout with the other cowboys.

My first reason is that you can save someone. You can save a life since the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program is all about taking care of horses,young cows, and mules ,and shipping them overseas to other countries to help people out. Luke knew if he signed up he can help rescue people in trouble. Think about it for a second. You can also help save someone who has suffered because of the war.

My second reason is that you can get a unique experience. Have you ever wanted to travel to China or Europe? Well you can if you join this program since the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program travels to many places to ship animals. Luke got to experience China,Europe, but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special to him. Luke also taked a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. You can get a one of a kind experience from this.

My third reason is that when you are done with your job you can just relax. Also you can go play with the other cowboys sports in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Luke had found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. It is not all about doing work there is some fun in it too.

In conclusion, these are my reasons on why you should join this program. You can get a good experience if you join this program. Bieng a Seagoing Copwboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world for him. ""I am grateful for the opportunity,"" he says.

For example, it was right when World War II ended that the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to recover animals for the countries that were left in ruins. I did this job of recovering cattle even when it was hard. I was helping not only for Seagoing Cowboys it was also my military service.

Another reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys is it opens up the world. When you are delivering animals to other countries there are so many things to see. You get to see marvelous places. For example when I was taking cattle to Greece I got to see most of Europe and China.

There are so many beneificial reasons for becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. You are helping others in need and having fun at the same time;once you have fullfilled your duties, that pleasure of helping out will stay with you forever.

If you are woundering where well you be going, you well going to 9 different countries.

It takes a month to get to China and two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

It also takes resonpablies, becasue you take care of animals. World War II just endend and we have to help out the countries that got ruin by World War II there 44 nations that joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation). Did I say you get to take care of hores, young cows and mules.

When my friend Don Reist gave me this chance, I went for it and now I would like to give you the same chance that he gave me. Exploring this vast world, helping your country and others, and facing the sea with new friends by your side are all things we do.

This world is big and changing each day. You may not get to go to Greece or Venice on a regular day basis, but being a Seagoing Cowboy opens your eyes to the true beauty in the world. I have gone to Venice, The Acropolis in Greece and the Panama Canal on my way to China. Traveling the sea shows you beauty and it honors your country and others.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is no picnic, but it is a true service to your country and other countries as well. After World War II countries were in ruins and in need of supplies. Seagoing Cowboys meet their needs because we bring them animals they may need , food they need and so much more. We serve the 44 different countries that formed the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaion Administration). We not only serve our countries, we face the sea with new friends by our side.

The sea may come across as fish, beaches, sun, dolphins and fun, but it is actually much more dangerous than you may think.

When it was my first time for the nightwatch it was hard because it was raining, the deck was so slippery that I almost got knocked overboard,but the small metal strip kept me from from going of the edge. I was lucky to be alive, but I didn't work for a while because I cracked my ribs. This may all sound bad ,but the sea isn't all seasickness, sharks and cracked ribs either. We know how to have relax because after the supplies are dropped off we have some fun like; playing baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and more games helped us have fun on board our ship.

In conclusion, the sea is full of fun, pain, service, and exploration. I sincerly hope after this you choose to be a Seagoing Cowboy because that is one thing you will never forget. The chance of a life time, to be a cowboy who rode the waves.",4,6,0.8280503749847412
c36a91a,"I think you should join Seagoing Cowboys. I joined when I was almost eighteen, and it was a great experience for me. I am sure it would be for you, too. There are several reasons you should join.

First, it helps many countries, such as China and Greece. This program was formed in 1945, right after WWll. This means that many countries are in need of food, animals, and supplies. We just take care of the animals on the way to Europe. Then, we give them to different countries so they have a source of food and animals.

Secondly, it lets you see many countries. It helps you to experience things you otherwise wouldn't. You can see new things, try new foods, and meet new people. You can also tour and see new places. I saw the Acropolis in Greece, rode a gondola through the canals of Venice, toured a castle in Crete, and saw the Panama Canal. This was a great opportunity for me to broaden my horizons, and it could be for you, too.

Finally, it helps you learn new skills. This job teaches you responsibility, because you have to feed and take care of so many animals. On my first trip, there were more than 300 horses! You have to feed and water each one several times daily. Plus, you have to clean thier stalls and groom them. And that is just the horses! There would also be cattle, livestock, and other animals. You also have to learn how to communicate with people properly. If you are on a boat for two weeks to a month, you can't mess around or fight.

The first reason that you should consider being a seagoing cowboy is that you are helping other people. You are helping them by bringing them cattle or other farm animals. By delivering farm animals to them you are helping them by giving them a food source. The people you help can eat eggs from chickens or drink milk from cows or even just kill the animals for food. Sometimes you might even just be delivering someone their pet that they shipped to safety therefore reunighting those people with their beloved pets. People can also use wool from sheep to make clothes or rope. That is how you are helping people.

The second reason is that you are helping those people's country. You are doing this by helping their economy. By delivering farm animals to them you are not only giving those people food and materials for themselves but, those people can sell them. By selling food, drinks, and materials or clothes those people are helping their economy and elderly people who cannot care for such animals. They wouldn't of been able to help their economy is they didn't have the animals to produce goods. That is how you are helping their country.

The third and final reason why you should be a seagoing cowboy is because you are spreading world peace. You are spreading world peace by giving another country something they need. If you help a country and its people they are going to take that as an example. They might help another country. Then, that country will help another and it will just keep on going like that. That is how you are spreading world peace.

Once, I got to go on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece. Finally, I got to see many parts of China.

The world is a wonderful place to see. Like I said off board we'd go cite seeing. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special."" paragraph 5. Seeing the world is speical and not most people can afford to do that.

Thoes are the reasons you should join. When you do this it's adventurous, scary, fun, and amazing. Those words explain it all. So join the Seagoing Cowboys. If you don't you would be missing on a great oppurtinity. ",3,6,0.7365546226501465
c4d3703,"In the year 1945, World war 2 has ended, With a long lasting war comes celibration, Joy, and freedom that has hid from the people for year's comes to spread joy accross the world. However there are sad things that come too, ruins. With war comes death, dispare, loss of hope, and ruins of what used to be a happy place to some people. The is a man named luke and a very large group of people are there to help.

Luke is a person who was influenced by a friend to join the so caled sea ""cowboys"" who help the broken countrys that were riped apart by war. However he went to many different places like eroupe and china and with that you get to see new places. After the animals dispatch from the boat, that will give the workers of the boat time to relax for a while because they will need to get ready to leave again. that mean's the workers have time to do whatever they want.

When the workers leave the animals to leave to thier new home they most likley have time to do somthing. Also if they are giding the animals by big towns you can most likley see the famous land marks or butifule sights on the way. to Luke it was a great experience.

The docs for a ship must have been near town's so the feel of being in a new place to you is a wierd but good feeling. Seing new places, historical land marks, new people, differnt costoms is wierd and different, but it is what is called home to alot of people. To be on a boat and sailng seas is a dream come true to luke, a one in a life time chance. It must have been a hard and dangerous journy is fun, but saying it was the best thing that ever hapend to you is somthing big, and even still saying that when you alomost die is still somthing.

So in all going around the world, sialing the sea, and helping people is a good feeling and to luke is the best feeling. Luke made the most trips as a sea cowboy. So his adventures were great and long but amazing.",2,6,0.6041691303253174
c4d960b,"Hi, my name is Lucas and I had an amazing experience by being a sea cowboy. I got to visit many places that back then many people cound not visit. Also I made a lot of good friends. When my trip with the animals was over my friends and I would kind of have a party we would play games like volleyball, fencing, baseball ext. Like I said this opportunity opened the world up to me. I am glad that I now understands other countries needs and the people from those countries. When I was done being a sea cowboy my family and I had like foriegn exchange students stay with us. I could also teach my family about the foriegn exchange student. Like what his country was like and what animals I brought to that country. Like I said this opportunity had a lot of good effects come out of it. So if you would like to travel the world and learn what different countries needs I suggest being a sea cowboy.",2,6,0.7777343988418579
c4f9b90,They should do the program because in the program you will learn how to be a cowboy. Also you will learn how to travel the seas and survive in cold wheather. So being in the program could be fun because you will learn how to be a cowboy. Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun. To train to be a cowboy you have go through obstacles and overcome your fears so you can travel the seas. You also want to be able to ride the waves so you be brave and save people from your enemies. You also defenitely need to be strong so you can overcome your fears and fight bad guys so you can take them down so that is why you need to be strong. You also need to be brave so if you get put in a bad situation you will know how to get out of the bad situation so you won't get hurt while you are in the bad situation so that is why need to learn how to get out of a bad situation. You also need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation if you do not stay calm then you will get hurt so that is why you need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation. You need to watch out for the terrible situations in the terrible situations then you will get hurt. In the bad situations you usually will not get hurt or injured. So if you are a cowboy you need to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations because you will get hurt. So that is why you have to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations. So you have to at least tryout for the seagoing cowboys program because you never know what could happen at the program. You could have fun or you could get hurt or injured. So you have to watch out for that so you do not get hurt or injured. If you want to be a cowboy you have guns to protect yourself and when enemies try to shoot you then you can shoot them instead. So you might not get hurt if you carry guns on you for protection. ,2,6,0.7080587148666382

Being a sea cowboy is a great experence for any type of young man. You use all types of skills like taking care of animals, sailing techneces, and even your athletic side gets used.

You get to explore the world and its uneqe sites like Europe, China, Greece, Venice, and more! I had many advencures away from the ship as well as on the ship. Once I toured an excavated castle in Crete. I also saw the Panama Canal on the way to China and took a gondola ride in the watery city of Venice!

You get keeped working hard cleaning and taking care of the animals but you also get a whole lot of fun! Two weeks may seem like a long time at sea but there are many things that make time fly by! When the animals are getting unloaded you can play games like baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals are being housed. There is also many other games like fencing, reading, boxing, and table-tennis to make the time go faster. The opportunity has made me aware of the suffering and hardships in other countrys. Why can't it do the same for you?

This opportunity is not all fun though. Once on one of my16 trips there where 335 horses and the hay and oats to feed them. All of the animals need to be watered 2 or 3 times a day so you can not get lazy! Stall have to be cleaned too!

If you get a great opportunity like this, do not back down! It may be an advencure just waiting to happen!

It made him think about all the people in other countries that are fortunite and unfortunite and their needs. Plus when he was 18 he could of been drafted for the military service but when him draft boat learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. And by the time i was discharged in 1947, I made nine trips-most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Besides the cattle-boat trips were unbelievable, cause i got to help people like; I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. But what kept me busy was caring for the animals during the crossings. They had to be fedand watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out at my aunt Katie's farm had prepared me for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On my second trip I served as night watchmen. My job was to check on all the animalsevery hour. But one night after my hourly checkup I slipped on a ladder and almost fell into the dark Atlantic, luckily a small strip of metal along the edge stopped me from falling. But I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. When us Segoing Cowbays got boared when we had to return the animals I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,and games also helped pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more then just a adventuere, it opened up the world to me.

c5a5c3b,"I, Luke Bomberger, think that it would be wonderful if you participated in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I have three great reasons why you should participate. You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. You would get to sail overseas. You would be able to have free time on your way.

When I say that You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules I mean that there would be 335 for all the types of animals. You would also get to have the chance to sail over the seas and have fun because you would be able to sign up with your buddy and travel together. The last reason is that you would be able to have free time to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime.

After reading these reasons that I stated I hope that you consider joing the Seagoing Cowboys. These are the reasons why I think that you should join. You would get to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. You would also get to sail over the seas with you buddy or even by yourself if you want.

To help these countries recover their food supplies,animald and more,44 nations joined together and formed a UNRRA. The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Like horses, young cows, and mules. So my friend and I signed up. We think you should sign up too.

The UNRRA was hiring ""Seagoing Cowboys"". This was a chance in a lifetime. It is good to join the UNRRA,because you help out people. It also helps you see new places you never been to. It helps you see new things. It a chance of a lifetime. You can buy things from every place you go too. You can tour around places. You can explore that new pace and you can also meet new people or friends. Maybe even if friends of your moved somwhere else you would probably go there country and see them.

It takes about two weeks to get from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern cost of the United States,and a month to get to China. Yes that might be awhile,but you can still do things on the boat. You also have to take care of the animals. You have to feed and watered two or three times a day. There is also a thing called night watchman. The night watchman has to check on the animals every hour. Just because you have work dosen't mean you don't have time to have fun. You can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds. You could also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing,reading, and whittling. The games helped pass the time.

I am just saying that you should sign up. Even though you have to do work you cant still have fun. You can visit new countries. You can tour around buildings. You can also explore the country. You can do many things if you sign up. You also help people if you sign up. By helping ship animals, food, supplies and many more.

First things first, you have to know to know what you do in this job. Here's what you do: you go to different states and continents and give them food and livestock after there has been wars there and fix up most of the tore down buildings to help them recreate their towns again and bring loved ones together again.

But also remember that it is very hard to get a job like this, so if you ever get a job opportunity for UNRRA, then you better take it, just like Luke said,""It was an opportunity of a lifetime.""

One other reason why you might like to do

UNRRA is if you possibly like to go around the world and travel, then this would be a great experience. Also if you would like to help people then this would be a great way to do it.

Also after doing all this work when you get back on the boat to go back to the loading station then you get to play all kinds of fun games, like baseball, volley ball, Table- tennis,

fencing, reading, and even whittling!

And at the same time you get payed to help people, travel, and play games!

I had a friend named Don. He and I were best friends. He invited me on this, trip, to go to Europe on a cattle-boat. I couldn't say no, it was an opportunity that was to exiting to miss.

So, it was 1945, the war was over in Europe and to help the countries that were shattered, we would recover their food, supplies, animals and much more. And there was this group called UNRRA. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"". So, we signed up.

We arrived August 14. That was the day that the Pacific war ended. We got on the SS Charles W. Wooster. It was headed to Greece. There were 335 horses and enough hay and oats to last the trip.

I had turned 18 before making it to Greece. I was discharged in 1947, and I had made 9 trips. And besides helping people, I had the chance to see Europe and China.

On my second trip, I served as a night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals. One stormy night, after making my hourly report to the captain. I slid off a ladder on my backside. My heart raced. I couldn't work after a couple of days because when I slid, I cracked my ribs.

I had some time to find some fun on board. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds of where the animals were kept in after the trips. And some more games like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling also helped me pass the time.

But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special."" In the passage I said .""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water."" I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canalo on my way back to China. I had the privilage of traveling around the world and experiencing different cultures and several coutries' history.

In conclusion, I believe that you and many ruined countries will benefit from this progam. It is something that you will always remember and will stick with you throughout you're life. You will also benefit from it greatly for many reasons that I have already stated before hand.           ",3,6,0.7524458169937134

This might convince others to participate in the program as well as Luke did. First of all in paragraph two it states what you do in the begining of being a Seagoing Cowboy, first you have to take care of horses, young cows, and sonetimes have to ship mules overseas. this is important becaues if you do not know how to take proper care of these types of animals you could lose your job and chances of being one of the Cowboys. Next you have to take orders in and ship them your self. It states in paragraph three you have to ship cargos such as loads over one hundred horses puls enough hay and oats to feed them. This is important becaues if you do not know how to ship the orders or don't know were the shipments go to you could lose your job. After all those requirements of being a Seagoing Cowboy or Cowboy (for short) you get to visit amazing unique places such as what it states in paragraph five, Besides helping people , I had the side benefit of seeing Europe,Venice,Italy with a city with streets of water, and on his way to China Luke saw excavated castles in Crete an marveled at the Panama Canlal. But seeing the Acroplolis in Greece was special,"" he says. This might excite the other people who want to participate in the program becaues, They might of dreamed of going to one of these countries or cities in there furture and this could be there chance to go. Later on after visting your favorit places there can be a risk. As it states in paragraph 7 Luke risked his life by serving as night wtchman as his job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night after making his report to the caption , he slid down a slippry ladder on his backside. he was happy to be alive. But he couldn't work for a couple of days becaues he cracked one of his ribs while slidind down that ladder. this can be a risk becaues you could die just watching the animals but in is a little unlikly if your a very careful. Last but not lest in paragraph 9 it states that, for Luke Bomberger it opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says.""it made me more aware of people of other countries and there needs.

""Seagoing Cowboys.""

Like Luke Bomberger he thought it was an amazing program. Seagoing Cowboys take care of live stock that are being shiped to countrys or states. Luke Bomberger was asked to join with his friend Don Reist Luke could not give up this amazing opertunity so he toke it. Luke Bomberger decided to become a Seagoing Cow boy.

The year was 1945 World War ll had just ended in Europe and many outher contries. The army had just sent some Seagoing Cowboys. The Cowboys were sent to help restore food supplies and animals. 44 nations joined together for the UNRRA. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys."" Luke and Don signed up to help with rebuilding Europe.

Luke signed up for the trip to go to Greece he turned 18 befroe going there. Besides going to places you would have the benifit of seeing sites such as Acroplis in Greece, or taking the gondola ride in venice Italy, a street with water. A Seagoing Cow boy also has very long trips to get to places somtimes like when Luke toke two weeks to get to the Atlantic Ocean or when it took a month to get to China. Seagoing Cowboys also have to care for thre animals and might run out of food to give them on one of there trips. A Seagoing Cowboys has thre advantages and their disavantages.

Seagoing Cowboys would have to leave their familys behind but they new that they would see them again. Seagoing Cowboys had a lot of fun on the trips that they came back from droping of the animals. They like to play games such as table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games. The games helped pass time until they got home to see there familys. One night Luke sliped and broke some ribs his crew would not let him work until he healed up. Seagoing Cowboys are like your family that is away from home.

When your part of the crew you have your own little family. When you go to what all the bad things in the world are you want to help them out . When Luke was done created awarness and that stayed with him. Luke hosted a number of internathinal students and exchange students visitors for many years.

The UNRRA hires Seagoing Cowboys to help take care of animals before we get to the countries. To pass time you would play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

Being in the Seagoing cowboy program will also give you the oppertunity to help people by sending food and animals over sea with you. You would have to care for the animals too as to help on the trip.

A seagoing cow boy can visit many places. Luke got to visit Europe,China,Acropolis,Greece, ride a Gondola in Italy,and tour a castle in Crete.

Besides visiting all the great places when you are still onboard there is plenty to do besides feeding and watching the animals all day. Luke played games and you would be able to also. There is baseball,volleyball,tennis tourments,fencing,boxing,reading and more. You don't have to sit around and do nothing.

It all started when the 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. We went everywhere, including Europe, China, Greece, and even Italy! I even have a spectacular story about me in Greece. I turned eight-teen before arriving in Greece, which ment that I could be in the military, but when they realized that I was a Seagoing Cowboy, they told me to just keep doing it for my service.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy I was even the one who made nine whole trips. The most of any Seagoing Cowboy! Being apart of this, was one of the greatest opportunities for a small-town boy like me. It was helping out on my Aunt Katie's farm had prepared me for the hardwork for the animals like by feedding and water them two or three times a day, feeding the horses bales of hay and bags of oats, and the stalls even had to be clean. One thing I can say about that part, is that it did keep me busier than ever!

There were too many fun times we had, but there were times that we didn't. On my second trip, I served as a nightwatchman, and my only job was to check on all the animals every hour. After I made one of my hourly reports, I slid down a very slick ladder. My heart was like a bullet beating so fast in my chest. I almost fell into the Atlantic Ocean. My ribs were so cracked, they said that they can't even work for the next couple of days, so I didn't.

Although there were scary parts of all the trips, there were fun parts too! I always had fun on board, especially after the animals had been unlodaded. We would play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games all helped pass the time.

parts of the world. Or maybe you can meet new people and make more friends. You can do that by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will have a blast meeting new peole and making new friends.

It dosen't matter were you are you can always have something fun to do. You can take a gondla ride in Venice, Ital, a city with streets of water. Or you can tour an excavated castle in Crete and marveled ath the Panama Canal on your way to china. But thats not the most important thing to do. The most important thing to do is help and save peoples lives. You can only do that when you are finished or taking a break. You can always have fun on the ship too. Like if you finished taking the animals to their countries you can play games like baseball, and volleyball games. Or table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and also games.

Once you start the Seagoing Cowboys program you can't stop. You can have all sorts of different dutties on the ship. There is something for every one. You better be perpared because you can see some really scary things. Like for example, some countries just finished with their wars so they can look really bad.

One reason, is that you get to help animals and people after WWII according to the text, ""World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more,""(2). You get to transport animals to new areas to graze. You'd be able to help people get out of poverty.

You could also get to see places you don't usualy see. For example, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,' he says. 'So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete""(5). Most people would never see those places in a lifetime.

Speaking of lifetimes, most people who live average lives will probably never get a chance to do this. ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy,""(5). After the job, you may never do it again.

While riding the boat, you still get time for fun activities like ""Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.""(8) So, you won't be completely bored while riding to the next area.

Luke(the charicter from the story) also said that ""being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. 'I'm grateful for the opportunity,' he says. 'It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.'

Taking this opportuniy had opened up a whole new world for me. I think you should join because you get to see unbelieveable historic buildings, sculptures, and you even get to visit old towns that have water for roads! Another reason that I thought was cool was to help other people in need and even only if you help one person you feel like a hero, this is the whole point of this program. You also get some free time, you do not have to work 24-7, for example "" The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the emptyholds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tornaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games had also helped pass the time."" The learning of the awareness also opens up opportunities to host and run facilities about this issue of people in need.

There are also times that are just incredible, in your spare time you can go sight seeing.

I, myself went to China and Eruope. Though that wasn't all, for me I thought going to Arcopolis in Greece was awesome. So was taking a trip to a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, which is a city with streets of water, it was amazing! I also went to a castle in Crete and the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys Program can also be a bucket full of fun!

Especially when were on our return trips after the animals have been unloaded. We (The cowboys) played a bunch of fun games that keeped us ocupied and having fun! We played some of our sports were there was empty hold were the animals had been housed. In those places we played sports such as baseball and vollyball. We also played Table-Tennis tournaments, boxing , fencing , and whittling. Reading was another thing to do to pass the time, but not as fun as the sports!

Joining this place will give you a lot of memorise to remember, such as saving animals or even people. You will have memorise of fun times or the sad. Or times you've fallen, or the times you've fallen and gotten up. It doesn't matter what kind of memorise they are, you will never forget them.

Luke also found time yo have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Another reason he join the program, because he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Luke help other countrys with thier needs and to provide food.

My second reason why he wanted to be a seagoing cowboy is because he wanted to help countrys animals, and be a great man. Luke claims that the cattle boat trips were an unbelievalbe opportunity for a small-town boy"", he says. Besides helping people Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china.

My third and final reason is he made about 16 times he crossed the Alantic ocean,and pacific ocean twice.

c8d2ca0,"Have you ever wanted to travel the world? Well guess what , I did whenever I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It allowed me to see the world like I never thought I could .

It was in August of 1945, me and my friend Don Reist received our orders to report to New Orleans . We arrived on August 14th the day the Pacific war ended . We both got our seaman's paper and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster we where headed for Greece . And aboared that ship was the cargo of 335 horses ,hay,and oats to feed them .

Being in the Seagoing Cowboys allowed us to be able to see the world while we where headed for the the places we where suppost to go . What the Seagoing Cowboys was, where assigned to take care of horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped over seas. It also put me on a lot of unique adventures and also a lot of many unique places.

I had turned 18 before we arrived in Greece and that meant I could be drafted for military service . When my draft board that I had been on a cattle-boat trip , they had sais to me ""Just keep doing that for my service "" . By time I was drafted from my draft bored which was in 1947 I had made nine trips in totall , And that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy

It was worth my time to be able to take those Nine trips . I was in Europe and also China . But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was my favorite of all time . It was also very fun to take a gondola ride in Italy , Venice

the city with streets of water . Being inn the Seagoing Cowboys

was one of my favorite things you can say different but I loved it .",3,6,0.8033543825149536

""So, what are you doing when we get back on land?""Don asked. ""I'll hopfully convince some young men to join the program. Last time I didn't get lucky.""I told him. ""Get ready cause we are almost hitting land."" Don told me.

I got of the boat and smelled the fresh air of New York. I had rented a home their to live in while I got some men to participate in the program. I put my stuff in the house, took my keys, got in the car, and rode of into the city.

Once I got there i started to walk around and found a group of men by an abandon building.

""Hello there I would like to talk to you about a program called the Seagoing Cowboys-"" The boys interupted me and started to laugh.

""Wow there we aren't to do some silly Cowboy thing. What are we going to go riding aroung town on ponies?""one boy said. All the others started to laugh while the boy started jumping around yelling ""he ha"".

""This is a serous matter and I would like you boys to listen.""Luke said frusterated.

""Whatever.""the boy said rolling his eyes.

""After WW ll many countries in Europe were left destruction cause of the war. So 44 nations joined together and created UNRRA who hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"". Seagoing Cowboys took care of animals that were shipped overseas. It isn't only that it's also an opportunity for you to go out and see how other countries work. I think you people might like it yourself.""I said but none of the boys seemed interested.

""No thanks.""they said and walked away. Except one boy.

""Uh, can you tell me more about this program you are talking of?""He asked with wide eyes seeking more information.

""Ok well I went to this one place where I......""I told him more and more about how exicting it was. I later learned the boy's name was Billy and Billy was the first one who sighned up.

The next week me and Billy looked and looked through the city to find any other young men who wanted to join. We only found ten. Later that week I called Don and asked him where he was at.

""I'm somewhere near you.""He said.

""What do you mean?""I asked then I heard a knock on the door, ""Sorry I'm gonna have to talk later someones at the door."" But it didnt matter cause he had already hung up.

I opened the door and there was Don. ""How did you get here so fast and still call me I mean there is no such thing has phones that aren't conected to walls! Or are there?""I wondered.

""Nah could never happen,"" Don said, ""I'll rented the house next door.""

""What really?!""

""Yep I'm here to help.""

""Great cause i need alot.""I said.

The next day Don and I met up with Billy.

""Billy this is Don."" I said.

""Don this is Billy.""

""Ready Billy.""Don said.

""Sure am.""He responeded.

That whole week we worked really hard to get people to join the program. Two months later and we were already nearly 200 hundred people.""Ok tomorrow I'm suposed to turn in the forms with all the names.""I said. ""Where do we turn all of them in?""Billy asked while eating bannna. ""New Jeresy.'I told them. ""Here we go!""I said.   ",2,6,0.5991840958595276

To cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, it only takes around two weeks, and about a month to get to China.

Caring for animals always kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship we were traveling on, and all of the stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on my aunts farm helped prepare me for hard work, but not for all of the dangers of the sea.

Luke felt that it would be a chance of a lifetime to go and be a Seagoing Cowboy, and he just couldn't say ""no"" to Don. In 1945 WWII ended and many countries were left in ruins. So Don and Luke signed up to help. They helped for about two years before they were released.

He says that he also has much fun on board as well, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They played games of tennis and volley ball where the animals once were. You'd have much fun on board and on trips.

They arrived August 14, Luke said, "" the day the war on the pacific ocean ended."" The men got thier seaman papers a nd then they boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, was headed to Greece with a cargo with 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them all.

Luke was 18 before they arrived at Greece, whitch ment he could be drafted for military service. "" When my draft board had learned that i was on a cattle boat trip, they told me to keep doing that for my service.""

Luke said besides helping people, had some side benefits of seeing Europe and china. But seeing Accropolis in Greece was special,"" Luke said.

It took 2 weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states of America and about a month to get all the way to china.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

This also let you help people in need. Such as if there was a earthquake or flood. you can help them rebulid everything they had.

It would be a good i dea for more people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because not only do you get to help people rebulid there life, but you get to see amazing places such as Italy, Europe, China, and so many more beautiful sites. joining can also teach you how to speak different languages, live on boat, become closer to animals, see things you have never seen before. This could be an amazing adventure and you could have great stories to tell the family. Not only would this be a great adventure, but it has so many benefits that you probably haven't thought about. Joing the Seagoing Cowboys program would help you so much in ways that can change your life forever.

In the passage Luke mainly talk about how this changed his life because of the amazing places he went to.

Luke talks about how he he was so happy to be with animals on aboat seeing someof the most unforgetable places ever, but what he dosen't say is that these people need more

Seagoing Cowboys. Without Seagoing Cowboys so many people would not have a home, fresh clothes, warm food, or food at all. Luke does although talk about the gorgeus sites. That is 100% true. You get to see some of the most amazing places in the whole world.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboys is so important. Many people wouldn't think that this is something that we need in the world, but it is. It is one of the most important jobs that we need.

Luke is right, how would you feel Jon if someone was yelling at you for getting hurt,said Rob. Shut up,Rob don't you agree with me that it is not fair. Not fair? The mans ribs are shatered.

Shatered? His ribs were touched. Luke yelled at him if he wanted his ribs touched by him. Then Jon backed out scard but he did'ent give up. The reason Jon is doing it is because he thinks that Luke purpesly broke his ribs. You see Jon did'ent have a choice to come here because he was forced by his mom. His mom sent him because he would not move out of there house and she wanted him gone.

Jon dicided that he would go talk to the captin about it. The weird thing though is he did'ent tell them that are else they would come too. So he went to the captin telling him lies. The captin got really upset and went to talk to Luke. The captin was very angry now and he was just about to push Luke over bored but he did'ent because he would go to jail. When he reached Luke he yelled at him. Luke asked why. Wy are you yelling at me captin? You know exacily why I am yelling at you Luke. No I really don't.

I am yelling at you because you purpusely broke your ribs. Where did you get that from captin. Jon told me that he herd you say that to yourself. Look Jon told you lies because even if I did do that I don't talk to myself. You don't, yelled the captin. No,said Luke. Great now I have to talk to Jon. Im comeing too,said Luke. So they went to talk to Jon. They found him in the lounge. They walked up to him and started to talk.

The captin told him that he had giving false infomation. Jon talked back and said he is lieing and he really did do it on purpose. The captin ignored it. So Jon told them his story. The reason I thought he purposely did it was because I thought all the people here were forced to do this too. Luke told him that he joined with his friend because they thought it would be fun so they did it. After they did it once Luke wanted to do it again because he liked it so much. After they told each others storys they settiled there argument and became best friends.           ",1,6,0.20363327860832214
cd3902f,"I think that other people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you could be saving other peoples life. Why would you sit on the couch and do nothing, when you can actually do SOMETHING. Instead of just sitting on the couch and watching Television you could be saving many of peoples lives that have been affected by the war. I'm not saying that everyone just sits on a couch all day and watches Television because I know people have jobs and kids and other important things to do , but I know that atleast 100,000 people in this world just sit around doing nothing. If you have free time on your hands why not help out some other countries that have been left in ruins and are in need of food. I think it'd be a thing to do if you have to much time on your hands.

People should come help other counties with the Seagoing Cowboys program because you'd be able to go to alot of places and go sight seeing while saving people. I know some poeple would love to go and see other places in this world but don't have a really good reason to except to go see some things, well now you do.

You can go to places almost all over the world to help other people recover from the war but while you're there and you have some free time you can also go sight seeing and take some pictures to bring back home if you want. It will be an epic adventure if you help out this program . Im positive that it will be a fun experience.

I know some people are probably thinking ""Well thats not our problem, that's their problem."" but it doesn't matter if it's their problem or our problem. If we were badly effected by a war I'm positive they would help us out. Now if you were badly effected by the war and left in the ruins without any food or any help wouldn't you want someone to help you? I know that I would want someone to help me. Why don't you pretend you're in their shoes? You wouldn't want other people to just sit there and not help out. I'm sure that those people are very thankful and glad that the Seagoing Cowboys program is helping them out. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great opportunity to get to do something and change the world.

Already fourty four nations have joined this program to help others out so why don't you join too? It may be a long trip to the destination you're helping but it's worth it. This is why I think that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys with me . I hope you agree with me and join this program to save lives and change the world.",3,6,0.7354906797409058
cd44a5a,"I am Luke Bomberger. I am a Seagoing Cowboy. This is a United Nations program to bring aid to European countries unable to provide for themselves after the war. We take care of the animals being sent overseas while they are on the boats. Our jobs are to feed and water the animals, bring the food up from below deck, and clean the animal's stalls. I know this sounds like a boring job that's all work, but there are many reasons why this job is so fun.

The first reason is because while you are in the countries you are visiting, you get to go sightseeing. I saw things like the Panama Canal, the Acropolis, and an excavated castle. I also got to ride a gondola in Venice. You may be able to see such famous landmarks as the Eifle Tower, or the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Oh, and did I forget to mention that you get paid for that? If you have always wanted to travel, then this job just might be for you.

Another reason is because you get to slack off on the return trip. On the trip home, you have dropped off all the animals, so you no longer have a job to do. This means you have free time to do whatever you want. When I was on return trips, we would start up baseball games in the rooms where the animals used to be kept. Other times, someone would bring a deck of cards, and we would spend hours just playing poker. Once, we even had a table-tennis tournament.

This is certainly a fun and exciting job. On a more serious note, this job can make you more aware of other peoples problems. There are many troubled countries across the world. You should do what you can to help. You could donate time to an aid cause as I did, or you could donate money to a charity. It really dosen't matter. Just do what you can. ",4,6,0.7296165227890015
cd6586d,"Absolutely Yes, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Why? Because it helps living animals and creatures. Livings things that me and you see every day. So you may be thinking why would I want to do this? Or why should I do this or maybe even what is in it for me? Well, I'm just going to answer those questions with one word,HAPPINESS! You might not know what I'm talking about but, you'll catch on later.

So, earlier in the passage you heard about me persuading you to join the (SGCP).

Well, now I'm going to tell you why. You should

join because there are animals such as;horses,young cows,and mules that need your help.There was a World War II in Europe where all these animals lived and they need help. Many of things where destroyed and people and countries where left to ruins. so, 44 nations joined together to make a group/union, called UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). That group hired us the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the animals.

So, I've giving you details of why and what I'm persuading you to do now I'm going to tell you how helping will be good for them and how it might

bring you happiness afterwards. It might bring you happiness, which it should because you will know that you did something good to help someone or thing else. If you are not happy and feel as if you were used and not getting anything you should stop and think about that because somethings wrong.I say that because you just did something amazing for something that has nothing to do with you which means you clearly have a great heart.

Next, I will be explaining what type of things you will be doing if you join the SGCP. So first of all, if its your turn to be the night watchman or women your job will be to check on the animals every hour. Secondly, the stalls always have to be cleaned, so some one will have to do that. Thirdly ,caring for the animals is a big part also so you have to make sure that the animals are watered and fed two or three times a day.

So you have

heard what I was trying to persuade you to do and why. Next you heard why you should do what i was trying to persuade you to do. Third you heard how helping will make you happy and help someone/thing else.

Fourth what type of things you will be doing if you help. Then, lastly all the details from each pragraph. Now you know why I want you to join the SGCP. ",4,6,0.8165460228919983

They needed the cattle boats for milk and meet to feed the people who had no home because of the war. I will list some reasons why he said yes.

Doing this could make a difference on these animals life. Think about if you were in this situation, wouldn't you want someone to participate to help you and take care of you.

I had two different part-time jobs and when my friend told me about this opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

I joined the Seagoing Cowboys on the day that the war in the Pacific ended.

My very first trip was to Greece. The ships had cows and horses on them. The Sea Cowboys had to feed them twice a day, clean out their stalls, and give them fresh water to drink. There was another job to be done on ths ship there was the night watchman. The night watchmen had to check in on the animals every hour then report it to the captain. This job can be very dangerous at times because one rainy night I went to tell the captain and slid down the ladder and almost went overboard into the dark, churning ocean. A small piece of metal saved my life. I was okay but I did have two broken ribs.

I Luke did the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy. I did sixteen across the Atlantic Ocean and two across the Pacific Ocean.

I also marveled at the Panama Canal on his way back from China.

On return trips after the animals were dropped off the men had fun. They had baseball and volleyball games in empty stalls, they also had table tennis tournements, along with boxing tournements. I also found time to have fun reading, whittling, and other fun games to pass the time at sea.

The Seagoing Cowboys would be a great way to help out others in need. I had a very amazing experience as a Seagoing Cowboy. I would want other young boys to have the same experience as I did when I joined the seagoing cowboys.

thinking about joing Cowboys who Rides Waves look here

For the last few years in my life i was a cowboy who rides the waves. Your probaby wondering how that is possible. After high school graduation my freind Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I helped out with feeding the animals,watching them overnight,and even taking them for walks when we got to land. It was probably the most fun to walk them though.

A few of the reasons I decided to become a cowboy who rides waves is because i love animals. Any type of animal. I also did not want to get drafted. I turned 18 before going on my first trip(it was to Greece) so i could have been drafted. When my draft board learned i was a helping with the animals they said to just keep doing that for my service. I was REALLY happy.

A few other benifits other than helping animals were going on a huge adventure through Europe and china. I once saw the Acropolis in Greece it was so amazing. I also got to see an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It was so cool taking a gondola ride in Venice Italy. The streets were water in Venice.

A really good part all alone is the thought of me helping World War 2 victams giving them new animals to replace one who have been killed or stolen by anyone during World War 2. We also helped give food water and supplies needeed to live to again people who suffered from World War 2.

Even though I got seasick a few times it was okay beause i got to see some of the world i would have probably never seen if i would not have joined what i did also i got to spend time with animals which was double amazing. If i had a chance to do it all over again i would because ut was a really amazing thing to do what i love

I am here to talk about why we should agree that being a seagoing cowboy is a really good idea so hang on tight and just listen, hope u enjoy .

Some good reasons to be a seagoing cowgirl/boy is you get to help animals while your traveling over sea. Also its a good experience and you might want to learn about the ocean, thats a good reason to be a seagoing cow girl or boy and you might want to try it out .There might be some big waves but your with animals traveling and helping out thtas important to do .Its also a beautiful ,wonwerful,aventure to explore .

I support Luke becuase he says thats its an one one life oppertunity. It was he got to travel over seas to Europe ,he went pass Greece . He also traveled over the Pacific Ocean twice,and the Artic Ocean 16 times .Its a good aventure and you should try it one day .

So he got to do alot of things that were totally awsome! I want to know do you think you should try it one day yes or no ? And please right about why you whould and who inspired you ?",2,6,0.793696403503418
d007c8f,"I crossed the Atlantic Ocean over ten times. I crossed the Pacific twice to help people who were struggling from World War II. The article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" writtten by Peggy Reif Miller was not only a story for encouraging people who are down and need to do something, but it also gives the main charcter's point of veiw too. Miller tells us how daring the adventure can be over seas, but what I tell is totally different. When I was over seas I saw many beautiful things. Miller may thought it was scary, but I assure you it is not.

When I was out of high-school I was working two jobs. I worked at a grocery store and at a bank. Then my friend Don Reist gave me a call asking if I wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was an opportunity of a life time. I said yes. It was 1945 and as you know World War II was going on. In August 1945, I received orders to report to New Orleans. We arrived the 14 of August, the day the Pacific War ended. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece. I could become apart of the army. The board saw I was apart of the cattle-boat trip. So they told me to stay on it. I was fine with it. By the time I discharged in 1947, I made nine trips. The most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Maybe one day you could become the Seagoing Cowboy to make the most trips. Maybe you could become apart of the army. If you become apart of the Seagoing Cowboy you can accomplish many things. I told you it's not scary. Your making exhilerating things happen.

The cattle-boats were an unbelievable opportunity for me. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special though. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It was extrordinary! I was done with the tours and we were crossing the Atlantic from the easten coast to the United States of America. I was on duty of cleaning stalls and feeding the animals. I was watch man for one night. I was making my report to captain when I slipped on the ladder. I most fell into sea, but I recovered. I had a few cracked ribs, but I was fine. I had time to have fun on board. I played many games with my friends. Some games we played were volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. A Seagoing Cowboy kind of sounds fun now doesn't it. You could have so much fun with your friends and other new people. You can have fun with the animals. The big part of being a Seagoing Cowboys is getting to say this, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" This awareness stayed with me.

So you got the point of veiw from other people like Miller and people who don't like the army, but now you got my point of veiw. People think it's scary or dangerous. Yes, it's dangerous, but fun. Not only do you get to help people, but you get to see amazing veiws and you get to encourage other people to do great things.

Secondly,traveling the high seas when your on board on a boat it can be somewhat fun. The cowboys play baseball and a little of volleyball to keep their minds bussy. This also includes table tennis tournaments, fencing and boxing, reading, whittling, as for games had also helped the time pass by.

In addition, this opportunity shall make you more aware of your surroundings. For example, the people that have their needs but maybe they don't have food or water to drink and knowing you did something good makes you feel good about yourself. Not only in your country but in other countries and their troubles that you may not think about or outside of your state. Just thinking about how many people out there in the world no matter rich or not they all need our help at times.

Lastly, once again the Seagoing Cowboys program can be a big influence in your life and the way you treat and think of others. Just image the way people around the world need money,clothing, and shelter. Knowing you made a difference little or big no matter what size of goodness changes the way you live and the way others live as well.

He got to spend time with animals, got to play games occasionally, got to be helpful, got to see amazing sights, and got to see his friends. The program was an awesome way to do a lot of things. One example is how Luke got to tour an excavated castle in Crete. He also got to see Europe and China. That is unbelievable opportunity for a boy like him. Luke got to have fun by playing baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be an awesome adventure. A quote straight from Luke was,""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

First, for some people some might think that Luke can convince other to join and I am on their side because if he is't able to convince people that how was he able to convince his friend to go with him. He could have just gone by himself and been selfish but he didn't want to be alone and wanted to be nice to his friend and asked him to come because he new that would have beeen the right thing to do. Luke was just trying be kind and nice ""He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Luke and his friend Don new that after all that time they didn't have to work two part jobs.

On the other hand, some might think that he shouldn't have to convince others to do that if he has to convince them than they really don't want to go. To some it might not have been a lifetime dream for some people or it might not have been a once in a lifetime opportunity. People are different and some are selfish so some might have thought that he really wasn't serious. So for some people they don't think that she should convince peopele to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

To wrap this all up, what I think Luke's point of view on convincing others to participate in thye Seagoing

Cowboys program that he should convince other so go and help because it is the right thing to do. Some think that he shouldn't convince people to go. But at the end of the day everybody is different and everybody think differently so what every you think it is up to you.,",3,6,0.6743277907371521

One day when we returned the animals, we played volleyball and baseball in the empty stalls.

So just keep on reading to see what those reasons are.

I think you should try it out but if you dont right now you might eant to at least reaserching this and see if you would like to try out this seagoing Cowboys program. I think you need to try seagoing Cowboy program beacause in the passage ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" There was a man named Luke Bomberger he loved this program he even experienced going over the Alantic Ocean six-teen times and also went though the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by the World War ll. Would you like to experiance that type of fun.

Also I think you should at least try this beacuse in the passage ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" It states in paragraph two that he helped recover their food supplies, animals , and more , forty-four nations joined together to form an UNRRA (the united Nations Relief and Rehabitstion Administation.) That needed to be recoverdfrom desasters.

I also think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program because it states that in paragraph six that you care about animals on the way back from safty. Would you like to save a pour animals life? It states that ""Bales of hay and bages of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship."" It also states that they have to clean the stalls. that would mean that the pour animals need your help because they need more people to help them out with the pour animals with feeding them and also cleanding there stalls.

Third of all I think you need to at lest try this is because of paragraph four it states that when he turend eigh-teen that Luck Bomberger was going to try to go to the miitary service, but when they found out that he was on a cattle-boat trip they said that he should just keep doing what he is already doing. That just by doing that it helped alot so he did not need to searve in the milatery.

You should work here because you would be helping the animals. You would help keep the animals alive. I think you would enjoy this type of program if you like animals. You would enjoy being with the animals and the people who work here. This is a very good job.

In this essay I talked about why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. In the eassay I talked about what type of jobs you can have. I think the people that like all types of different animals would like this program. This a intersting job to do. On our breaks we enjoy playing games.             ",3,6,0.7568123936653137
d45a14a,"In my opinion I think the Seagoing Cowboys was a wonderful experience. I was asked by my good friend Don to join and I thought why not. This would be a great opportunity to interact with people in need and travel around the world. I automatically signed up.

We started our expedition in August of 1945. I got to see many places during the program. That included a gondola ride in Venice, an Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and much much more. This program is excellent if you aren't a very worldly person, but even if you are it's great to see more!

This program is also good to be more involved in excercise. You have to feed and water the animals two are three times a day. Also, stalls have to be cleaned. When you spend so much time with the animals it sort of creates a bond between the two of you. However it just wasn't work and work, sometimes you have to take a break. Whenever the animals were unloaded we got to do fun activities like baseball, volleyball, fierce table-tennis tournaments, you get the idea. So that's how to get an easy workout!

This program makes you realize how much we take for granted. People are constantly starving or dehydrated, whenever we think that food and liquid is something easy to come by. Also countries are suffering under constant warfare and are very vurnerable. This program allows you to understand what it's actually like to really suffer.

These are the reasons that more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It really opens you up, by helping people all over the world. This is why I believe more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.",3,6,0.7463731169700623

And because he had just graduated from high school. he didn't think it was nessisary to go and he had a leave at home even tho he had a family at home. He didn't want to just leave them at home with out him. Becuase he had no one to watch them when they was at home alone with no one to talk to. He desided to stay and not go so he can be there with them and he was going to pertect them from harmes way. he loved his family to much to just leaver to join a cowboy group with people her didn't know at all so he said No and that he was staying with them. Because if he would have left it would proboly change ther life and his forever. they didn't want to stay home by there self for a long time he wanted to stay and help them out around there house and other stuff. And because it was to danges for him any way that is why he didn't want to go.

d4e943a,"Hello , im Luke from the Seagoing Cowboy program. I`m sure you you have heard about me. We have so much fun aboard the ships some things you might get to do are: playing table tennis, fencing,games of baseball, volleyball, and boxing. If you are not interested in those activities we also read, and play games to pass time. The best part about the job is going to all diffrent countries.

You also have to be aware that you have to do many jobs like: taking hay and oats to stalls, cleaning the stalls, and serving as night watchman ( you have to be really careful if you do that job because if it is raining the deck can be slippery and you could fall and hurt yourself.) You also get to take turns with other crew members while on the ship. When we reach the the country where we deliver the horses you get to explore many other things. Like I have explored a castle before. You also might get to ride the streets of Venice, Italy.

I hope you have read this and are happy to come. Make sure you are hard working , and are strong to carry food for the animals. We will appreciate you coming aboard to help with the animals. we hope you decide to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Thanks again , Luke Bomberger.        ",3,6,0.8063341379165649

In this essay you will be hearing about the best reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.I know it sounds weird but it is a lot of fun. If you said no at the end I will guarantee you would want to join.

Here are some reasons why you should join this program. If you like to travel the world you can go many places this would be the best place for you. My name is Luke Bomberger and I have been to places like on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy the Panama Canal and the excavated castle in Crete. You can even find some fun things to do on board such as table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games can also help pass the time. We even played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

It was so much more than an adventure. It opened up a whole new world for me. It made me more aware of people of other countries. That awareness lead me to lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. When my friend Don Reist asked me to go on a cattle boat I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. I guess I was right it was an opportunity of a lifetime. I actually didn't I was going to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Yet it happened and I am greatful for it happening too.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy is a lot funner than you think. These are just some of the wondenrful things about being a Seagoing Cowboy. There is much more to it. As I said earlier I wasn't expecting to become a Seagoing Cowboy,but it happened. Yet most of all you make a lot of new friends. So if you said no at the beggining have you changed your mind.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see things you might have never seen before. In paragraph 5 it says Luke got to tour a ecavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. He also saw the Acropolis in Greece. You get to see these things maybe once in a life time.

Seagoing Cowboys get to spend a lot of time with animals. The animals are mules, horses, and etc. You have to care for them all the time. You have to take them to the places they need to be. It says in paragraph 3 that you get plenty of oats and hay.

When you have free time you can play games to pass the time. In paragragh 8 it says that the crew men play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournamnets, fencing, and boxing. They play these games in empty holds where animals have been housed. The fun things to do are thoses. So being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun to.

That is why being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun and cool. When your a Seagoing Cowboy you get todo all this cool stuff like sightseeing, games, animals, and you get to be overseas. People might not like this job but I personaly think it sounds

fun. So come be a Seagoing Cowboy today.",3,6,0.8500128984451294
d57a1f8,"The Seagoing Cowboys is an amazing program waiting to happen. I'm Luke and at first, I was unsure about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, but now I'm sure I've made the right choice!

Many don't truely know what the Seagoing Cowboys is. During World War II, many animals were sick and had a scarce supply of food in Europe. The UNRRA decided that the needed a special position for horses and cows. That is the Seagoing Cowboys.

Some people may wonder about the experience and commitment of the Seagoing Cowboys. It is an outstanding experience for anyone! I get the daily benifit of seeing sights in Europe and China like the Acropolis in Greece. I've also rode a gondola in Venice, Italy! What else is on your bucket list? In addition, I've toured an excavated castle in Crete and saw the Panama Canal on my way to China!

Any sea lover or animal lover should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It took a few weeks to travel on the Atlantic Ocean from the east coast to get to China. I attended to the animals and feed them in the ships.

Many people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is no fun, all work. You are wrong! We play activites like baseball and volleyball in empty areas. We always enjoy the competative nature of table-tennis, fencing, and boxing when we are off work. Any readers would love to join, as many Seagoing Cowboys love the places a story can take you. Games are a jolly part of any off day with the team. Also, the experience is even more exciting when you bring a friend. Sure, all of the Seagoing Cowboys are your family, but a friend makes the family even closer.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is one of the most rewarding things that has ever happened to me. I believe anyone should be a Seagoing Cowboy if they want. This experience made me get a better grasp on what other countries (and not to metion the animals) need. I hope that ou will be a Seagoing Cowboy because, it is ""hays"" (days) full of fun!",3,6,0.8497949242591858

If you like animals you get to help them. Animals such as horses, cows, and mules. You can feed them, and bring water for them, and most of all care for them. Cleaning out the animals stalls and putting food in their bales might be smelly but at least you are doing something to help.

You can also have fun. There are so many activities to do with your friends like baseball and volleyball gmes. There is also table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading,and whittling.

You would also get to travel around the world to different places to sight see. Examples of that are you could go to Greece seeing the Acopolis, Europe and China, and take a gondola ride in Italy.

This trip will make you realize and be aware of the people and counties and their needs. Your helping people meet their needs. The more people helping the less people struggleling to make a living in this world. Their are so many people that do not have breakfast to wake up to, or a warm bed to sleep in, or even toys to play with. That is why we need you.

These are reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program. There is so much you could do that it is a really amazing opportinity. To help animals, to help people, and traveling learning about different cutures, making new friends and having fun!!",3,6,0.6652194857597351

The Seagoing cowboy is when you or someone else that helps take care of the animals on a boat , while they are crossing oceans. That is kind of like joining the milatary or the army. You are basically risking your life for other people, some peope you probably don't even know. It can be a lifetime experience.

It also can be a huge opprtunity. Like Luke couldn't say no to for trying something new after he was done with school. He was also at a young age. Starting early. After you are done with trying something new, you will realise that you have done something wonderful.

While you are working , you also realise that you are having fun while doing it. You could be working hard and having fun at the same time . Some people think ,if you do something that can take your life, isn't fun. I'm just saying if you like to do something then work hard to acomplish it.

And I'm not just saying that you have to do that ,but once you do it, you could have fun by doing it. Just like Luke did. Before finishing school , you should make plans for what you want to do. Dont wait to the last minute to think. Making differences is a good thing, not a bad thing. It seemed like Luke didn't know what Seagoing was, but it was something new so he went on and did it.

Seagoing can also give you a opprtunity to have fun with animals , if you like them. Luke grew up in farms, so I guess he liked them. He was prepared to work that job. I wouldn't want to do that, because I'm not a big fan about animals. But you like animals, you should try being a Seagoing Cowboy or Cowgirl.",3,6,0.6842795610427856

First, I knew the adventure the trips held would be great like when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I got to meet new people in the places we traveled to. I even learned of some new cultures. Every trip had something different or new about it. Also,on each journey the other volunteers I traveled with became some of my closest friends.

Next, I became a seagoing cowboy for the exploration. I experienced so many new places for example there's the excavated caslte in Crete or the Panama Canal on my way to China. On some nights the ocean seemed to be a black endless void, but on clear days it looked like a beautiful blue mass. I also saw great foriegn marvels that I never imagined being able to see in person.

Finally, I joined the program to help people. Not only was I taking care of the animals that would bring livestock back to the nations, but I was supplying them with food. The people were always grateful to see us arrive with what was going to help rebuild their home country and their nation. We were repairing war-torn countries.

Each and every reason including, adventure, exploration, and helping people in need, are why I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. Although, I never would have thought about it if my friend Don, hadn't asked me to come to Europe with him on a cattle boat. He played a big part in changing my life forever.

I aslo know this because it said that Don Reist invied him to go Thats how he got to to go to the program and with is friend. i also know this because it said that i was a opportunity of a lifetime.

Luke claims they were good and bad somtimes I know this because it said that ketp luke busy they had to feed and watered two or three times a day. I aslo know this because it said bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. I think that luke had alot more claims but those were the most imporantant ones. The thing that was the harest was to feed the animals and much more and that they had to more and more things to. and to much more. That the claims that luke had to do I think he had to them everyday.

There is alot more claims so here is more I think the was more claims I know this because it said helping out on aunt katie fram as a boy had prepared luke for hard work. I also know this because it said that served as night watchman his job was to cheak on all the animals every hour. I think that help him on his trip across seas because he had more work. That how I know that he was go on the trip and I think that he did a good job. I think is job was hard and did not realy do anything but feed animals.

Luke claims where hard i know this because it said that but not for the dangers at sea. i aslo know this because it said that Luke also found time to have fun borad. I think he got bored alot on the ship and he was tired. I know that he was bored because it said that table tennis tournaments .I think that he had tournaments on ship because they got bored. I think that they had to do some things to get there like get the anmials and load them up and do some things to get some fun time. I think that they had to do stuff to earn that free time and to do alt of things and play games to.

I know that the ship was boring and fun i know this because it said that the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games. i also know this because it said that they have fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time. I think that they had fun on the ship with all the things they could have done and but they still had to work on the ship to.

Helping people and amimals is a nice thing to do. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys then you get to help people and animals. When you help some one, that feels good right. When we help amimals to, that will make you feel twice as good from before. if you were a pearson in neeed of help then u would want some one to help u, so pay back the favor anad join the Seagoing Cowboys.

This program has been a very good experiance, ''luke has said.

I got to learn how to feed the animals and keep watch.

It? even better since Don is with me. I think that this Seagoing Cowboy is a great program. Since this is such a great progam I should convince other people that they should join. There are many reasons why.

People should join us. People should join the

Seagoing Cowboys. The first reason why is that there could be more people feeding the animals,water them two or three times a day. They could make sure thet there was hay for the animals. Also the people can be a watchmen or two. The people could also be night watchman.

They could just help others. Some people could go on an other ship and do other jobs there. They can have some animals in a pen. They can have a person to care for them. They could have the same jobs on the first ship but be on another ship so they can deliver the animals and get more done and be able to deliver them at the same rate.

""If I asked more people to come and help it would be a huge opportuinity for them to take. they would get the experiance to serve the ship and do what has to be done,"" said Luke. Everyone who took the chance or job would be a huge help. We could have many ships go out. They could get the job done.

So explorers, if you would like to have an adventure this is the job you may want to try. People will realize or they will be aware of people in their countries and their needs. As a group effort people make a difference. This job would be good for you. This job isn't all about hard work. There are some fun things too.

On their way, Luke went and seen different places,like China! Convincing others to participate in this important job would be hard. I think it would be hard because it is hard work. You also have to go overseas , away from your family and friends.

It would be hard to convince people to participate, or help. This is because, it is hard work, and your always busy. Here is an example from the article,""His job was to check on all the animals every hour."" That proves that he is always busy. ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" That is an example that he is hard working.

They have to go overseas to Greece to work as a Seagoing Cowboy. Here is an example from the text, ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece."" People would miss their friends and family. They would also be sore from all the hard work they have to do.

Luke was greatful from start to end. In the beginning he was greatful to participate. In the middle, he done hard work , visited and saw great experiances.

d7b6d6c,"People should do the Seagoing Cowboys program because just like I have been in it there are a lot of great things to do out there in the sea. I started out when I graduated in high school when my friend told me if I wanted to go to a trip to Europe. When I accepted to go to this trip to Europe I went to a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" program where I got to take care of animals like young cows, horses, and mules. This helped me how to take better care for animals.

Besides helping all the animals that I could I went on many trips as well. One of the trips that I went to was to China, and also went to a gondola ride to Venice, Italy, and a city with big streets of water. I even toured to an excavated castle in Crete, and even marveled at the Panama Canal when I was headed to a trip to China.

When I was crossing to the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States

it took two weeks and a Month to get to China. While I was waiting to get to China I got busy because I had to feed the animals and watered two or three times a day. I had to check up on them every hour and report to the captain. When the animals got unloaded I had some time to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had lived. After last that I was happy to go to the trips that I went to and helped me with things I will do in the future.",3,6,0.8610281944274902
d7e01ba,"There are many reasons I think you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. But I am going to tell you about some of my thoughts. I was just a small town boy when my friend brought up this proposal. I couldn't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity. You get to go to Europe by cattle boat. You get to take care of people and animals. Who doesn't love animals? You get to bring them food.

These animals and humans have been through too much. It is the least we can do. During the trip I became old enough to go to the military, but the recruits saw what I was doing and they told me to stick to it. I was serving my country in my own way.

I also got to take multiple trips, so if you are really into it you get multiple chances to help others. I think I took around 9 trips. But it isn't all work and no fun I actually got to see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, go on gondola rides in Venice,Italy, explore an excavated castle in Crete, and I was astonished by the Panama Canal on my way to China. I wouldn't have seen any of those places if I hadn't taken the risk and become a ""Seagoing Cowboy."" But don't get the wrong impression it was hard work, definitley. But it was worth it seeing people and animals treated the way they should be.

I also had some cowboys I got to pass time with. We would play baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. We had table-tennis tournaments, we would do fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other various games.

But being a cowboy taught me many lessons. How to not be greedy because there are those who are less fortunate then us. It taught me to take a risk, work as a team, succeed as a team. I gained awareness about the people from different countries and different races. I almost lost my life on one of those trips but I would have lost my life doing something I truly loved. So that is why I think you should become a ""Seagoing Cowboy."" So are you in for the long haul?",4,6,0.8824842572212219
d7f2966,"Hi my name is Luke and I am going to be telling you some interesting parts about the Seagoing Cowboys program that might convince you to become a of it soon.

One interesting part that I liked about it was the cattle-boat trips I went on. On the cattle-boat trips I helped watched the animals so they were fed and healthy. I was also a part of helping many people and animals. Maybe you would like to be a part in that.

My favorite part about the whole thing was I got to see many interesting places and famous sites. I got to go to Venice,Italy to see the streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete. That was amazing! I also saw the Panama Canal on my way to China. I bet you would love to see some interesting historical sites that you might possibly share with some people.

If some of you like fun games like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whitting you would sure love to become one of the cowboys. Me and all of the other cowboys played these games after the animals were unloaded from the ship. We played where they stayed at. It was a fun time!

It wasn't just an adventure for me it opened up the world to me. I was grateful for this opportunity. I hope you will be too. If you loved what you heard then please become one of the Seagoing Cowboys soon!",3,6,0.7610486149787903

You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! Trust me. We all need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program!

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great oppertunity to help those in need to recover their food supplies.

Not only can you help, but this job does inquire some fun! You have the benifit to see and tour special landmarks and places that you have never seen before! It is quite an adventure! It is an unbelievable oppertunity to see all kinds of sites (especially on the job!).

On board, you can also find time to have fun! When you are on return trips after the animals are unloaded, you can play many games such as baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis in the empty holds where the animals stay. Fencing, reading, whittling, fun games, and boxing make some boat trips exciting!

Luke had a friend named Don, wich if it wasn't for Don luke wouldn't be out there. Luke was working a two part job one at a grocery store and one at a bank. Then Don told Luke to go to on Europe cattle boat,and Luke couldn't say no. It was an opportunity of a life time for him.

It was 1945 and World War 2 had just ended for Europe, and many contries that were in war was nothing but ruin. So some people's job now were to help those contries get back in shape, so 44 nations came together and formed a UNRRA. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of animals that were shipped over sea, thats what Luke and Don sigend up for.

A lot of people may say this task is verry dangores and that nobody should do it. But if Luke and Don didn't help ou then a lot of people could die because they have no shelter or food. They helped by going to Greese with horses for all the people and food for them and the horses.

Luke had turned 18 by the time they got to Greece to help out, but turning 18 also meant that he could be drafted to war. By 1947 Luke had already made nine trips to help people out. Nine trips was the most any ""Seagoin Cowby"" has ever went before.

In this story I read there was a man named Luke and he became a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". Luke helped out so many people on his journey. It was important that people would help Luke out. A lot of people would say that this was dangores and noby should do it. So like i said before, if you were Luke would you go and help our would you still work your two time job?

World war ll was over in Europe. Many countries were in the ruins and low on supplies and food so 44 nations jonied together. They are called UNRRA. The UNRRA hiring Sea Cowboys to take care of the animals. I was thinking about it. The next day me and Don went to go sign up.It was August 14, the day the pacific war ended. Me and Don got our papers. So we borded the SS Charles W. Wooster with 335 horses and oats and hay to feed them. We were heading to Greece.

I turned 18 when i was still on that boat. I could be drafted for the military service. I was on nine trips. That is the most any Seagoing Cowboy of history! A Cattle boat trips were an amazing opportunity for small kids. i Have been to lots of places like Europe and China but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was tha best. Also the gondola in Venice, Ilaly was cool. Now i know why they call it the streets of water. I also went in a castle in China and marveled the Panams Canal on my wat there.

It took two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the eastren coast to the United States, but the trip to China took FOREVER to get there. It took one month to get there. ONE month. I thought it was a year, but it was worth it

On my second trip i was a watch man. I never want to be one again. I wanted to go to bed. One time i went to go and cheak on the animals becaues that is my job. Anyways i went to give a report to the boss and i slipped down a siplery ladder because it was raining. My heart raced as i was flying in the air. I was heading to open space on the ship. A metal along to edge stopped on my side. I didn't work for a couple of days because i craked some ribs. But that is better than being dead.

But after all

that happened it was really fun on bored. We played Basketball and vollyball. When the animals had been houseed we played boxing, fencing, and table- tennis. But we didn't just play games we sometimes read and whittling.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was more than just adventures for me i helped my family and i am grateful for the opportunity. It has made me more me think about others and what their need is and to always help.

I am Luke Bomberger and i graduated and i worked in a bank and in a grocery store with my friend Don Reist. Me and him signed up to by a Seagoing Cowboy. That changed my life, and i am glad i did take that oppoutunity of a life time.

UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the hores,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.

They received their orders to report to New Orleans. ""We arrived August 14, "" Luke says, "" the day the Pacific war ended. "" With a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. ""When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. "" By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips_ the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, "" he says. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis",1,6,0.6725468039512634

The details from the article to support Luke's claims is in paragraph 4 Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips- the most of any seagoing cowboy.

It took about two weeks for Luke to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. They had helped the people by helping time feed there animals.

da3c348,"I think that people should join Luke's participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I have four reasons why you should join and you will have fun.You will get to go places to help in the seagoing program.

If you join the program you will get to go to places you'll go on boats. If you never been on one then this could be your first time riding one to the other side of the Earth. One place you'll probably go to is New Orleans. You'll like it if you never been to a different state or different countries. You will get to help people all over the world.

Second is that if you join the program it could be an opportunity of a lifetime. You can miss out a lot of fun stuff people would do if you don't join the program.

Not just the people that join the program would like it. The people that you are helping would like it because you are helping them and taking care of them. Imagine you needed help I know you will like it because someone is taking care of you. So you should join the progarm and help people or animals that need your help.

Third is that you can meet people that are from World War II you'll get to help them the ones that got affected from that war. If you join the program people would like to join too if you tell how much fun it is and how much people your saving or helping. You can invite your friends to come with you too and you wouldn't be alone with no friends it might be better if you bring a friend along with you, so that you have someone to talk to at the trip.

Last is that your encouraging people to come join the program. You might end up getting on tv so that people all over the world can see what you are doing to other people or animals. If people see you what you are doing maybe they might want to do that too and would want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. One animal you will probably see on the ship is 335 horses with enough hay and oats to kept them fed.

There are my reasons why you should join the program you will have a lot of fun. I know I am having a lot of fun helping and being part of the program. I hope you join the program if you do. I will help you and how this program works you can also bring a friend if you want. It is your choice to bring a friend along if you want to, if you don't bring a friend i will help you to get started for the first three days because you'll know how everything works before the fourth day. See you there at the program if you join the Seagoing Cowboys program!",4,6,0.8221355676651001

Also in paragrph 5 it says "" Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China"".

My experience there was very unique and full of adventures. I made a lot of animal friends. I would recommend this trip to anyone who likes to travel and likes to take care of animals.

One reason you people would like to go there is because there are a lot of animals there. Some of them including horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. So, if you like animals, you should join Seagoing Cowboys.

Another reason you should go there is because as a Seagoing Cowboy, I have traveled overseas many times and the reason is because of cattle boat trips. I have went on them nine times. I have also seen Europe and China. Although, seeing the Acropolis in Greece was a special visit for me. Also taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with a lot of water. I also toured a castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal. So that is another reason I enjoyed joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

Last but not the least, I loved when we played games. We usually played after the animals were unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. We also played Table-tennis, fencing, boxing. We read too, these were all the things we did to help pass time.

I hope that when some of you join Seagoing Cowboys, you have as much fun as I did and hopefully you return safe and sound from Seagoing Cowboys. Thank you very much for considering to join Seagoing Cowboys!

You should join because you can have an adveture a great one, so great that you will never forget it, according to the artical.

db2d113,"Hi and im Luke and I am in a program called the Seagoing Cowboys. The UNRRA hired us to take care of horses,and young cows,that we ship overseas. My friend and I joined together. You may or may have not heard of it.

The seagoing cowboys are a group that helps countries recover the food suplies, animal, and lots more. We bring three houndred and thirty five horses with enough oats to feed them to the people. I think you should join them now to help people in need.

There are many reasons to join this amazing group. There are many reasons that you should join. One is you get to help people. But you benefit yourself by helping people in need. You also get to sightsee. At the different places you go. I got to go see the Acropolis in Athens Greece. I also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city filled with water and finally I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marvleled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Some other reasons are that you get to sleep in a boat you don't do that very often. Finally on return trips after the animals have been unloaded you play games. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals were. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

But being one is more gratefull for me than an adventure. It opened up the whole world to me. ""I am gratefull for this oppurtunity"" I say ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

But being a Seagoing cowboy has some dangers. This is during World War Two so enemy soldiers could be roaming around. Or also when i was on the boat. I was a watchman. My job was to check on the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to my captain, I slid down a slippery lader on my backside of the ship. A small strip of metal along the side kept me from slidding in to the dark Atlantic. I am happy to be alive. But I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

I hope you take this into consideration on joining the Seagoing Cowboys to help other people. Also be with your friends and have fun.       ",3,6,0.8850302696228027

So of course I couldn't just say no because if I would have to be just carzy It was a life time opportunity.

It was in the year of 1945, it was the time of World War II. So to help people recover, 44 nations joined to form a UNRRA. The UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So the next thing you know Don and I were signed up.

In August 1945, we received our orders to go and report to the New Orleans. "" We arrived August 14 ,"" Luke said. Which was the day the that the Pacific War ended.

Helping out on my aunt Katie's farm as a little boy helped me a lot to prepare me for this job. But not for the dangers on the seas that I had to face. On my second trip I was watch man for all the crews out on the boats. My job was to check all of the animals for every hour",2,6,0.6218053102493286

Program

Luke thinks that you should should prticipate in Seagoing Cowboys program. I mean,why wouldn't he,he had a great time there and he thinks that you would to. Just in case you don't believe me I will provide some details from the story to prove it.

For instance,in the story he even says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like he knew it was going to be great experence for him and it could be a great experence for you.

Another example is in the last paragraph when he said that he was gretful for the opportunity to be a Seagoiong Cowboy. Now i'm just stating the facts to to you that he is trying to convience people to be a Seagoing Cowboy and if your not agreeing with me yet then I guess there's no way of convincing you.

I have another piece of evidence since you still don't believe me. He also says that Luke also had fun on board. This piece of evidence just proves that he had a good time just being on the boat.

In conclusion, I truly think that in this passage he was trying to convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program and Ithink that you should believe that to. I gave you my evidence and my reasoning why I think this and if you read my evidence you should to.",2,6,0.6598963737487793

If these place sound good imagen all the places you could visit if you become a Seagoing Cowboy.

In addition to going to places you have never been before you also get the chance of helping people that's homes are in ruins due to World War 2. There is and organization called the United Nation Relief and Rehabilitation Administration which is also known as (UNRRA). This organization helps contries recover animals,food suplies and more. 44 nation join together to help these contries in need. So if you want to help these contries than becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is the right jod for you.

A Sea Going Cowboy works for the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relif and Rehababilitation Administration). What I do is I take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped over seas.

Some of the benifits of my job is that if you are drafted into the army you can use this job for your service credit. One other benifit of my job is that I had the oppourtunity to see Europe, and China. But seeing the Acropolis of Greece was the best. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. I also was able have a tour of the great castle in Crete. Plus I was astounted at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Other benifits you might like if you like agriculture would be getting to feed the horses, clean the stalles. and pulling bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower parts of the ships. I definitly liked this part of the job because I grew up helping out on aunt Katie's farm and loved every minute of it.

Plus on your way home with out any responsibility to take care of the animals. you can play games like, basebal,volyball,table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading. and willting. These games also helped pass time on the way back from your journey across the seas.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than just a adventure for me. This experince made me relize how grateful I am. It also made me aware of people of other countris and their needs. It also opened my eyes up to the world to relize not everything is about me and my little small town, and that there are other peolpe in the world besides me who need help. And that awarenes I was talking about has stayed with me through my whole life. Leading to my family to host a numbe of international students and exchange vistors for many years now.

Three reasons for joining the Seagoing Cowboys are that the Seagoing Cowboys help people affected by wars, the Seagoing Cowboys get to see many amazing places, and the Seagoing Cowboys have much fun on their journeys.

Most importantly, the Seagoing Cowboys save lives. The ""Cowboys"" take trips with many animals, and all of the supplies to take care of these animals. When the animals arrive at their destination, they are given away to hungry families. The text reads, ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys""to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

Equally important,Seagoing Cowboys got to see amazing places on their journeys. The Cowboys travel all over the world and went sightseeing evrywhere they went. When they went to Greece, they saw the Parthenon and a excavated castle in Crete. They got to see many differnt sight in China. The text states, ""' So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.'""

Lastly, the Seagoing Cowboys had a ton of fun on their boat rides, despite the fact that they had to take care of animals. They played volley ball in emty stalls. They also had table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. The text reads, "" Luke also found time fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.""

It was a great opportunity, and I got to do so many things that an average small town boy would normally never do.

I met new friends, helped out people and their countries, and got to visit so many amazing places.

I loved that I got to see all the sites.

I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, saw the Acropolis in Greece, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

It was so unbelievably marvolous that I made nine whole trips of exploring and being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times, and the Pacific Ocean twice.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you will be able to do everything that I did, maybe even much more.

If you aren't already convinced, with getting to explore and tour many parts of the world, then you should know this.

With joining the Seagoing Cowboys, you get to help people and their countries' needs.

After World War 2 there is a lot to recover from in Europe and many parts of the world.

By joining us and working for the UNRRA you would be helping by taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules being shipped overseas to the needy countries.

If you like animals and don't get sea sick too easy, I say you join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Going on this journey made me more aware of people of their countries and their needs.

It changed me in a wonderful way, and it will do the same to you.

The new friends, exploration, sites to see, and people to take care of is just a few of the reasons to consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

Some people may get scared because they are in the middel of the sea and they lile to be with there famielys at night so the familys can keep them safe.

There were 44 notions that joined together to help in p2.

Luke diddnt know his life would change so fast that he got a job in p1.

He had 2 part time jobs and his friend invited him to go to Europe but Luke knew he cuoldn't say no.

There were many countries in ruins in p2.

The countries that were left in ruins were in Europe and the month and year was August 1945 in p2.

It took 44 nations to help the countries get food supplies, and more back iin p2.

So then now he has been on nine trips since the first ever trip that he has taken. Luke was always busy tending the cattle during the day. He was having lots of fun even when he got knocked over the boat and broken his ribs. He was playing board games and everything like that to keep him busy while he was healing.

The reason of Luke going on trips across the oceans because he likes it and he was born to do it. Also his freind asked Luke to come with him to keep him company during the trips. Luke was waiting for some thing to drastically change his life and he to his wish off the drastic change. Luke would stop going with don if Luke didn't like the motion sickness,or because there where a lot of storms,or he didn't like tending the cows during the long and tiring journey. If the possibility was that Luke didn't like the sea his freind would be like are you ok and or something like that.

In conclusion Luke loves the sea and he wants to keep going out and adventuring the wild and the unknown. Luke couldn't say no because it was his freind don and he wanted to explore another island. Luke loves the same because he likes tending the cows and he likes his fellow crew mates that are with him on his journeys to the out and the open sea. Another reason that is because he wants to be in dangerous storms and worlpools. Luke want to take the risks in the dangerous sea.",1,6,0.6100617051124573

This journey is not only about sight seeing but also about taking care of the animals. You might be thinking why would I join just to take care of some animals ,but what I think is that it is teriffic taking care of some animals. If your still not agreeing with me I will support my oppinion so you can understand. It sees in the story, Luke knew it was an opportunity of a life time, so he went for the journey.

dd9ca3f,"Hello there! I'm Luke. What do you want to be when you grow up? A farmer? A surgeon? How about a Seagoing Cowboy? No, it's not a job where you ride seahorses with a Cowboy hat (Although that would be awesome). Being a Seagoing Cowboy meant a lot to me, and if you are a young boy in hopes of helping those in need in this war, it is the job for you! So here are reasons why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

First of all, Seagoing Cowboys help countries ruined by WWII by taking care of horses, young cattle, and mules taken overseas to them by us. In a way, you not only help that broken country, but you are helping the U.S. When you help us help another country, they will most likely help us back, forming alliance for war purposes. So you not only help them, but us as well!

Last year in 1947, as a young boy, went on many great adventures to amazing places. Along with helping people, I also went to places like an ancient Greek acropolis, Venice, Italy to ride a gondola, and ancient China, where I excavated a ruined castle. Along with helping those in need, I also got to admire the great Parthenon, or see the Panama Canal. These places are only a small handful you get to go to as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Along with the sights, you get to travel the open ocean. If you are an ocean person, you probably want to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Traveling the sea is an amazing experience, as seing unexplored islands, the galaxy at night, and sparkling blue water is quite a life-changer. Rarely did I ever see a storm out on the Atlantic, so no worries there.

Overall, being a Seagoing Cowboy is the job of a lifetime. I remember doing all these things, and I still do them today! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a way to forget about WWII, and see the world as a peaceful place again. With the right training, this job can help you see the beauty in this fine world. So if you want to forget about war, and help those in need, see extraordinary sights, and travel the sea, then join us! I'll sea you on the high seas!",3,6,0.8558938503265381

Written By: PROPER_NAME

""Whoosh Splat"" those are the sounds of waves crashing against my cattle boat. These are also sounds heard by my crew and I ""Seagoing Cowboys."" We are people who are hired to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. You should look for an opportunity to sign up to be in the Seagoing Cowboy's program because you can go sightseeing, you get the satisfaction of helping others, and you can play games to pass time.

First of all, we can play fun games onborad and just relax. While some of you might say, that we can play games anywhere anytime. Yes, that may be true but playing games on a boat is probably someting not many people have done. For example, We found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We can do these things to pass time when you think things are super boring. Also, you just get a time to enjoy being on a boat wih your crew and relax so you can just have fun.

Second, you get the satisfaction of helping others. People might say they could just do it themselves. They could but the main part of being a Seagoing Cowboy mainly consists of helping people in need. We get to help countries for a good cause. For example, we get to help people recover food and feed a hungry family. The best part about this job is, you get to take care of animals and keep them safe while the family can get set up once again.

Lastly, we get to go sightseeing. Some might say, you could just buy a plane ticket and go wherever you want. While that may be true, we don't have to pay to get here. For example, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,"" I said. You can stop and see countries you'd never imagine going to. You can stop and see famous landmarks that you've dreamed of visiting. The possibilities are endless!

In Conclusin, You should look for an opportunuty to sign up be in the Seagoing Cowboy's program because you can go sightseeing, you get the satisfaction of helping others, and you can play games to pass the time. My job as a seagoing cowboy is to give families hope and let them be joyous because of you. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. it opened up the world to me.

I was helping people affected by world war 2. They were really hurt by it. Every body was crying over the dead bodys of their lost loved ones.

We tryed to help but they refused for us to help them. They said they wanted to be left alone. I do not under stand why they are so sad. Yes their freinds and family is injured and in serious condition or deceased. But i would want someone to aid me if one of my family members was in critical condition. If i was like that i would want some help to. Because we all have heavy duty first aid kits for the injured.

So we helped the ones who wanted aided. And took the ones who needed serious medical help. Others came to we all went back. And then we came back and i met George. he wanted to come back with me. at first i said no stay at yor home. as soon as we were leaving i felt really bad for george so i came back for him.

You can visit famous places and you get to help others. You also get to see the Alantic and Pacific Oceans. those are some reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Here are some advanteges of joining. You get to help familes and visit places like Europe and China. You can also visit the Acroplis in Greece, take a gondula ride in Vernice, Italy, see a castle in Crete, and see the Panamal Cannal. Luke saw all of these things. The artical says "" Besides helping people,[Luke] got the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.""

It also involves hard work to move the animals. You have to feed and water them two to three times a day. Sometime you have to be the nightwatch and check on the animals every hour. The article says ""

Caring for the animals kept Luke busy... Bale of hay... had to be pulled up from lower holds of the ship.""

And when you are heading back home you can play games where the animals use to be. So the trip home is very relaxing. The article says "" The cowboys played baseball and volleyball...""

Luke had a great time going to take the cattle across water. Luke had the opprotunity to see China, Europe, taking a gondola ride, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete, then marveled at the Panama Canal. Luke was lucky to be able to get that job. People interested in joining that program shuld go out there and try to get it. There are seven good reasons people should join that area of job vacinity. One good reason is it will be fun because you could get to see some things you have always wanted to see and you could go places you have never been before.

The second reason you should join is its for an extremely good cause because it helps animals get where they need to go. Another reason people should join is because you could inspire people to do good for the world like start someting new. The fourth reason people should join is they could get an adventure out of it like luke and traveling to Crete to see an excavated castle. The fifth reason people could join is that. The sixth reason is it could start a chain of good things people do for each other. The final reason people should join is it could make people aware about other countries needs and their people.

People should join because it can help the earth them and everyone else. Luke didnt join because he knew he would get more money he joined because ""He couldn't say no. He knew it was an opprotunity of a lifetime.""

""Im grateful for the opprotunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Luke had a great opprotunity and he took it that made him get a better start in life thats another reason people should attempt to get the job when its offered. The job may or may not help them in life but it might help somebody else who knows maybe it will start a chain of good deeds.

In conclusion this could help people get a good start on life and get a start in their country. People should join becaus eanimals need their help- to get across water. Th eting their doing is for a really good cause they are trying to help animals so they basically arent put in confined

spaces. People would do that job because they would want to help animals, the enviornment, and even people and their countries. This gives people the chance to get to work better and get out of working at a grocery store.

Everyone should get out there and join. It

helps everythin and everyone.   ",2,6,0.7259679436683655

Don't loose me here becasue I'm about to tell you some of my favorite adventures, and the lessons I have learned to really see how the world works. I hope by the end of the argument you will be so convinced and enthusiastic about joing the Seagoing Cowboys program as much as I was!

The most amazing place that I have ever visited was probably Greece. I found Greece to be the best because there were so may fantastic ruins and buildings that the Ancient Greece built thousands of years before my time. The Acropolis was a very beautiful sight to see because you could tell that the builders had done a great job of building it, so that it would last a long time. I could proboby write all day about Greece, but I want to share some of the other wonderful sights I got to experience along the journey.

The gondola in Venice,Italy was acculay pretty fun to ride. Seeing the Italian buildings accualy was neat site to visit. You could relaxing on the gondola trying to learn Italian. Venice had kind people, so if you think that you would be mistreated because you're a foreigner, you're wrong. In europe the people are kind and generous to everyone. Going t differnt places might be a klittle nearve wreaking, but after about two trips you'll get used to it, and that's what you'll want to do. The Seagoing Cowboys not only lets you travel, but also learn different languages, meet new people, experience differnt jobs, and so much more. I'm not going to spoil all the fun of being a Seagoing Cowboy beause I want you to fell exitement when you hopefully want to become one. I did miss my family, but the job and traveling kept me very busy and aware of what life was like.

The best part of all was giving a little homeless boy in China some clothes and food. That boy was the sweetest child I've ever seen in my whole life. seeing him with a big smile gave me a better future. tha smile and journey with the Seagoing Cowboys was amazing. I hope you will pariceipate with the Seagoing Cowboys because it will change your life. Joing them was the best deciosn of my life.

It took two whole week to cross the Atlantic Sea. Luke Bomberger had a job as a watchmen once and it didnt go to well he. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour he was going to cheack on theam when he flew and he broke his ribs.

Some things that you might do if you join , like Luke Bomberger is,""To take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" Not much but wait till it turns into an adventure.

Something eles that you might do is , while your on board , you can see a lot of intersting thing that you never knew about. Like different countries,small towns,or little islands. Like when Luke was on his way to China,he excavated castle in Creete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China .

He saw many beautiful places and met many interesting people, as such he would recommend the program to somebody. In the following paraghraphs I will present luke's arguement and hopefully convince you to join ""The Sea Going Cowboys.

Luke starts his story as a young boy [fresh out of high school] working at a grocery store and a bank, when his friend Don Reist invited him to work on a cattle boat with him. He accepted and went off on the cattle boat bound for europe. Luke seems to have had fun working with the 335 horses on their first trip to europe and before arriving in Greece, luke turned 18. As such he was drafted.

Luke was told just to continue working on the boat for his servince so he spent another two years working on the boat. He says that he helped alot of people in China and Europe but he also got the benifit of seeing wonderful sights and places; like the Panama Canal and Acropolis or Venice. He says that aside from his adventures he learned of how lucky he is to have things like food and a job when people in the countries he visited were much less fortunate.

Enough about all this seriousness, let's talk about the fun activities on the ship. Luke said that the men on-board played all kinds of games like Base-ball and volleyball in empty holds when the animals were gone. The men also enjoy games like boxing fencing and best of all, reading; the men also had tournaments for table tennis.

So, in short you get paid for working a third of the time, exploring foreign countries the second third of the time and playing games the last third of the time. There's no other way to describe it other than ""Best job ever."" ",2,6,0.7766207456588745

Get to explore places you've never been to! Just take it from me, ""I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China"" That shows that you can see lots of places, but that isn't the best part!

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helpes pass the time."" We enjoyed the rides back, but even that isn't the best part!

Imagine the waves crashing against your boat while sailing to countries left in ruins by World War 2. They need people to join the seagoing cowboys so they can send supplies. You should join the seagoing cowboys because they help people, visit unique places, and it is a great opporyunity.

First of all, the seagoing cowboys help people in different countries. Some people think they are just sending supplies over seas. However, the cowboys along with shipping supplies and food and animals go along with the shipment. Seagoing Cowboys also headed for Greece with a 335 horses in the cargoalong with food to feed all the horses. I think this would be an excellent job to participate in.

Secondly, the cowboys visit unique places. Some people think on jobs like this you won't see anything. But, the seagoing cowboys have seen parts of Europe and China. A seacowboy named Luke has even toured a excuvated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. I infer that a lot of people see a lot of different places.

Lastly, it's a great opportunity. People may think it's just another job and a waste of time. But, it opens up the world to people who never seen the world before.

He was exicted to go on the Seagoing Cowboys program. Once he did go he already took nine trips. If he didn't like going back and forth he would have been part of the program. This is telling you that you would likely like the Seagoing Cowboys program after all. If Luke point of view can see it, you can see it.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is to help take care of the rhorses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke wanted to help so he signed up, like you should.

why you shouldn't join is because you might fall overboard and noone might noice that you fell. Or the ship might fail at working and sink and you might not have a boat incase that might happen. What if the ship gets hit and you all start to sink.

We whent everywhere the crew and me. Im tell you it was amazing I was about 17 or 18 and we crossed the pasific ocean to China and all kinds of other places!

We joind that program because it would be an exiting adveture. The other most importan reason we joind is because we get to help many peole acrossed the world and isent that what its all about?

The jobs you could have on board are somewhat fun but some are not fun at al like the droppings of the animals someone has to clean thoes up but not all are so bad, my personal favorit was lowering the flag to set sail when the wind was blowing.

Now on the boat you also have to be carefull it is slippery when a storm comes by and you could slip on the wood. But I do have to warn you about lowering the flag, I was up on the ladder on stormy night and I slipped and slid dow the ladder on my backside and heading strigt for the edge of the boad but I was stoped by some metal rims on the side but I still could not work for a few days because of broken ribs! So as I was saying be very carefull on the ship.

The top is also very fun you and your crew could crack jokes and on the way back we ues to play games read, wittel, and boxing so you kids these days can do what you normaly do in your free timelike play on thoes ear phons of yours OH im sorry i ment Iphons or you kindel ices oh fire kindel fire not kindel ices how silly of me but you know what I mean

""Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than just an adventure for him it was a life changing event. Which opened his eyes to see more of whats out there in the world."" Luke said.

Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.

The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowboys, they then both signed up. LIttle did Luke and Don know, this job had a lot of risks.

The Seagoing Cowboys were a great part of an even greater orginization, the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Adminisrtation. This orginization was made up of 44 nations. This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that he was taking, but he wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the people that needed his help.        ",1,6,0.7597556114196777

You might think that it is stupid, but I bet you do not think the military is stupid and that is who you are working for. It might not be out there battiling, but you are saving animals lives and providing food, clothing, transportation etc. When you bring them back to the people. Not only are you helping people you get to see amazing views. Plus there is more than one job on the ship that you can do.

While I was on the ship it was a huge adventure. Every now and then we get to go on tours and explore the world. When we were on the ship and there were not any animals aboard we played games, and just had fun while going to the next stop. We played games where we would have kept the animals. This is a serious matter, but you can also have fun and be responsible. When you are on the ship you have to be careful and responsible, You can have fun every now and then, but you cannot be playing all the time.

This was much more than adventure. I really got to see the world and the people there that had many needs. What the world really was that I had not payed much attention to. This is a lot better then trying to have two part time jobs. I am serving my country, and if you want to but do not want to fight I would say you should do this.

As you go on this trip it does not just teach you about that country it also teaches you about hard work. You can also find a way to have a good time and meet new people. On thins ttrip you will find it is a good way to learn about how people had to live and how it was hard in 1945 for many people to live and have food, as compared to now when everyone is walking around with a iphone 6 and drinking starbucks with lots of food and money.

One reason i think Luke joined because like he say , he think it would be an opportunity of a lifetime . in the passage it states UNRRA hires seagoing cowboys to take care of horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas , Luke and Don signed up . The passage also states in August 1945 , they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans . They arrived August 14 which was the day pacific war ended .

Another reason i think Luke wanted to join , because his friend was their and he wanted to be with his friend , and do what he are doing now . The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle boat , they told him to just keep doing that for his service . The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant he could be drafted in military service .

The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time .

I've been to several places all over the world and all of them have been very exciting. If you were to be a Seagoing Cowboy, you would see several places too. Although it could take up to a month to get to the place you need to be, there are several things to keep you busy and entertained. One way you would keep busy would be caring for the animals during the crossings. You would have to feed and water all of them two to three times a day, but its fun if you love animals. Although it can be fun on the way to your destination, its most fun on the way back when all of the animals are off of the ship. We would play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and others to help pass time and keep us entertained.

You might think that feeding, watering, and cleaning their cages for the animals would be boring, but thats not all you do on the job, I promise. There are so many great opportunities to being a Seagoing Cowboy, so many sites that you could see and be a part of. I'm very lucky to have made the choice to be a Seagoing Cowboy and I encourage you to be one too.",3,6,0.7717860341072083

is to convince others to join the seaongoing coboys program.To do so you must be willing to go out to sea to feed people of the war that went on. It will take two wweks to get to Euope and a month to get to China.But you

have to make sure the animals are healthy. Also you hav to give them watter on very hot days on borad the ship.Last you have to check on them every hour.

The first

reason luke wants people to join is to help people in need. So they can have more help and more hands to feed the animals on the journy ahead.And so there is more clothes and more aid to help injerd people.

and to help unload animals. that is the first reason people should join.

The second reason people should join is because of the great seanery. You get to play games on the way back to get more supplys.And it can open the world.It can make people aware of the suffering of other people that lost there home. And maybe lost family in the destruction that the war made.

The tird reason to join

is to be happy that you are helping people that cant help what the have lost. And to get thanks from people that you helped. Also raise awarness to let people

get help. To donate caned food supplys.and new clothin to peple who need it more.

In conclusion

it would be nice if outheres would join this program. Also you can help the animals. You will be fed on the trip. and you can get very good at helping others with social skills. And you will be very good at being a farmer with animals.",2,6,0.6815909743309021

The SeaGoing Coyboys program will let you experience many amazing adventures. In August 1995, we recived our orders to report to New Orleans. We arrived August 14. The day the Pacific war ended. We got our seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W.Wooster, headed for Greece-with cargo of three hundred thirty-five horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

The Seagoing Coyboys program also lets you visit many unique places. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Eroupe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city of streets and water. I also toured an exavated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on my way to china.

The reasons you should go is that you can see new places that you have most likely never seen before or have never visited before. You will have an experience of how to take care horses,young cows,and mules that would be shipped from place to place.

But along the way you'll find out what it feels like to take care these animals like as if you were on a farm because these are animals that would be on a farm. Besides you could try new food that you could have never tried in your life. You could have a chance to meet new people. Also while in that place you could experience what their culture is and also what they do in that culture. The only places you would go to though would be italy,china,new orleans,and greece.

So on your way these are the places you could explore and visit for a while. So these are the reasons I think you should take the chance to become a seagoing cowboy if you ever got the opportunity to become one.",2,6,0.8187435269355774
e5ea0d5,"Just think of all of the amazing things you could see and experience being a seagoing cowboy. Everyone should become a sea going cowboy. Theese three reasons are why: Everyone would get to see/ go to amazing places, the seagoing cowboys would get to help people in need that were affected by World War ll, and you would get to help care for the animals on board the boat. This essay will explain why everyone should be a seagoing cowboy.

The first reason that everyone should be a seagoing cowboy is because you will get to see/ experience amazing things and places. In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves Luke, the main character, said he went to places like Europe, China, Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal! Who would not want to go there?

The second reason everone should become a seagoing cowboy is because the goal of the seagoing cowboys is to help people that have been affected by World War ll. Just think about how much that would mean to the people that the seagoing cowboys are helping and there family. To have lost everything, but the seagoing cowboys helped those people back to a good life.

The third reason everyone should become a sea going cowboy is because they get to take care of the animals. If they need food, someone gives them food. If they need water,someone gives them water. If they get sick or hurt somehow, then someone needs to help get them healed, etc. If the seagoing cowboys are not going to help someone or see something they are on the boat taking care of the animals.

Everyone can/ should become a seagoing cowboy. They should become a sea going cowboy because theese three reasons: they get to see and experience meny amzing places like China, Europe, Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal, but those are just a few. They are helping people that were affected by World War ll. They also get to take care of the animals on the boat! Just imagine this life, helping people that were affected by the war, taking care of animals, playing games and experiencing amazing places. What could be better?   ",3,6,0.8162691593170166

e5ff050,"Help Change the World

Wouldn't you like to help countries recover from ruins World War II left? Well now you can the UNRRA is hiring ""Seagoing cowboys"" to care for animals that were shipped overseas. It would be nice to join and be known as someone who did something for a country, helped keep animals safe and healthy, and helped countries recover their food, animals, distruction etc.

First It must be a good feeling to be known as someone who did something for a country. Although not everyone may agree, not only will others be amazed but you, yourself could be proud of yourself. Someone once made nine trips which was the most of any Seagoing cowboy. Also you can be a hero to millions by doing one great action. Overall this can be a great lifetime opportunity for many, and you can be one of them.

Also how amazing would it be to know you helped keep animals safe and healthy. However others may not agree, many inoccent little animals pass away because no one was able to save them. But you can make that difference. Caring for the animals during crossing keeps you busy. Especially if you are a animal lover this job is just perefect for you!

Finally, helping countries recover their food, animals, distruction etc is like a miracle to them knowing someone is trying to change the world. Of course not everyone believes this is true, but put yourself in their shoes imagine you lost your house had no food and no one came to rescue. But then that one person comes and changes everything for the better. You can do it everyone can even just by doing the smallest kind of act you can make a difference. Keep that in mind it'll not just be a better world for you but all of us.

Doing something nice, even the littlest act can lead you a long way. You earn respect, respect isn't given it's earned and it's not hard to earn it if you do it the proper way. So what are you waiting for there's a world out there waiting for you to change it. And joing the Seagoing cowboys program is a fabulous start! Good luck!

e630ec3,"The reason why Luke went to Europe was because his friend Don invited him to go. When Luke graduation he had two part time jobs but when his friend Don invited he to go to Europe on a cattle bout luke was happy to go with his friend Don.

Luke was on the cattle bout from 1945 to 1947 because he had to make nine trips from the Eastern coast of the United States to china that is a mouth away from the United States. When Luke was on the cattle bout he found fun thing to do like play baseball,vollyball in the empty holds where animals been housed they even played table -tennis, fencing, boxing and reading whittling.

In Luke point of view he was happy that he got to go on the cattle bout and help people get the animals to Europe and chine but it took two year to get all the animals to Europe and chine. Luke was a seagoing cowboy when he was on th cattle bout. It was more then an adventure to Luke it opened up the world to Luke.

If you were caught up in a big mess in World War 2, I bet you would want people to help you out. If you participate in the UNRRA with me and a lot more other people, you could help those type of people. Think of all the lives you could save and help.

It would be really fun to do this because after you do our work, we play games like table-tennis tournaments, fencing and boxing. We would also read books and do whittling. All of those things are really fun.

If you come with us and help the people in need of things, you could see awesome things like the great wall of China. You would go to France and see and hear Big Ben. All of those places would be awesome to see and if you help us, You would get to see it for real and not on a picture or something.

e661b4b,"I am going to be writing about a story called A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves. the things that I am going to put in here are reasons why Luke's convincing others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Other Cowboys should join in the Seagoing Cowboy program because there are a lot of horses and other animals that they could help take care of. The next thing would be because they get to go on cattle-boat trips that are unbelievable oppurtunities for a small-town boy. The third reason would be because the Cowboys get to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. The last reason why others should join is because when Luke said that it was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger.

Now I am going to tell you details that support Luke's claims. At the beginning of the story it said that Luke had been working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. UNRRA ( The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas so Luke and Don signed up. In August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14, Luke says that the day the Pacific war ended. They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe And China. Luke says that the cattle-boat trips were unbelievable oppurtunities for a small-town boy. caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. Luke found time to have fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. It opened up the world for Luke Bomberger.

So what I wrote about in the story was about a story called A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves. The things that I put in the story were about reasons to join the program and to support Luke's claims. Like for the first one I put that they could like play baseball or volleyball on their free time. That they could get to take care of animals (lots of animals). Like in the second one I used ideas from the story for that paragraph. Thanks for reading hope you enjoyed.",2,6,0.8116690516471863
e66d620,"Do you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy? Well,if you do then join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program consists of many reasons to join. Just one reason is so you can help people out if you join the program. For example,I helped out countries with gaining food supplies,animals,and more. We had to take care of the animals such as horses,young cows,and the mules that were all shipped by sea.

Besides helping people from around the world I had the benefit of seeing diffrent countries,such as Europe and China. But to me seeing the Acropolis in Greece was especially special. But,so was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,the city with streets of water,but other than that I also traveled to an excavated castle in Crete and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. And I was grateful for seeing all of that.

There are also many things that can keep you busy. I know what really kept me busy,caring for all the animals. They all had to fed,at the most two to three times a day. Also bales of hay and huge bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship. And the stalls all had to be cleaned.

If you think that was hard work...don't worry! Life as a Seagoing Cowboy isn't all hard working. I still had fun doing it! I played games with my pals,we played all sorts of them. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where all the animals stayed,we had the time to play table-tennis tourtaments,fencing,boxing,we read,whittling,and the games all helped to pass the time.

But to me most importantly about being a Seagoing Cowboy,was to be able to let it open up the world to me. It made me more aware that people in other countries and their needs are suffering at hard times just like us. I hope that after reading this you learned alot more about being a Seagoing Cowboy than you ever did before, and I hope that after reading this you will want to be one too.",4,6,0.8810046315193176
e6bea39,"Why should luke join this program? Luke should join the program because its a opportunity of a lifetime. Plus, he gets to spend time with his friend. Lastly he will experence new things. Its a good thing he went on with going to do the program cause it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

This program will be a opportunity of a lifetime. In the prompt it states that he couldn't say no to his friend, and that he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Secondly Luke says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable for a small-town boy."" Besides helping others he likes to taking water rides Venice, Italy. Thrirdly Luke was able to tour excavated castle in Crete and Marveled. But mostly went there to spend time with his friend.

Luke didn't go to the program he went there to see his friend. First he gets a phone call from his friend saying ""Hey would you like to come over to Europe then asked about cattle boating. His friend Don Reist confnced him to come out and see him, but not only see him but to go cattle boating with him. But yet not only did Luke do the program and gets to hang out with his friends he gets to experence new thngs.

Luke was able to experence new things while on this trip, and learn some to. World war 2 was over in 1945. Luke was a watchman and he had to check on the animals every hour. Luke found time to have fun the cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table tennis, and more.

In conclusion, I think Luke choose the right chose because he would still be doing the same thing being a cowboy and farming. Since he went cattle boating he's not the same in a good way. Also it was good to go see his friend and cattle boat with him to. These are my reasons why Luke should join.   ",3,6,0.6107738018035889

Well if you think that the Seagoing Cowboys is bad well, let me tell you about it!

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for just a small-town boy. In the Seagoing Cowboys, you can go on avdentures and visit many unique places.

Another good thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you can see great veiws like the Acropolis just like Luke Bomberger

Another reason why you should be a Seagoing cowboy is because you are helping the animals a lot through a tough time. it is kind of fun because you get to see over 300 horses and all the other animals. This also can be a hard job because you have to watch animals allmost 12 hours a day. Another how it might be hard is because sometimes you might have to be the night Watch man and just watch the animals all night. You will also feed the horses 3 times a day since they eat so much.

""No. I don't want to. It seems boring."" Sam said.

""Don and I are doing it. Wouldn't you want to help someone in need?"" I said.

""How about this, I will talk it over wiht my parents and see what they think, then I will make the final decision. Ok?"" he explained.

""Ok. Meet me at the Big Tree tomorrow at 3."" The we bothed walked off.

I really hoped that Sam would agree.

We would be like the three muskateers! I thought.

Don, Sam, and I have been best friends since I could remember. DOn had already been my neighbor, so when Sam moved in a couple houses down we decided to start being friend swith him. I'm glad we did.

Don and I have been apart of the UNRRA for a while now, and we were home for a brake. Our only mission while being home is to try and get people to join. We already got a couple, but we needed more. There is always work to be done on the ship.

""Hi Mom."" I said walking into the kitchen. ""Dinner smells good.""

""Good. How was your day?"" she asked. ""Anybody new recruited?""

""Still working on Sam. He said he would tell me his final answer tomorrow."" I told her.

We ate dinner and then cleaned the dishes off.

""Mom, is it ok if i go back out to town?"" I asked.

""Sure. Just be back before dark.""

I went to the common area because there is normally still a lot of people ther at this time eating, playing with animals, or little kids running around. I walked into the common and sure enough, people were there.

As I was walking, I felt a tap on my back.

""Looks like we had the same idea, Luke!"" It was Don.

""Yeah! So glad you're here. Have you gotten anyone?"" I asked.

""Yeah actually. Those men sitting over there talking."" He pointed to 3 men chatting on a bench.

""Good job!"" I congradulated him. ""Sam and I are meeting at the Big Tree tomorrow for his final decision. He said he was going to talk it over with his parents tonight.""

""Oh good. Let's go get some more people."" he replied.

""Hello."" I said to a man around my age petting his dog. ""I'm with the UNRRA group, the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" and I was wondering if you are interested in it.""

""Hello, and sure. Tell me about it."" he said, with a kind smile.

""What UNRRA stands for is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration and what we do is carry animals on ships to different places. FOr example, we went to Greece and unloaded there. We carry horses, young cows, and mules. We also have spare time on the ship. We do table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, readong, whittling, and we can play volleyball and baseball.""

""That sounds very exiting!"" Where do I sign up?"" he askeed.

I handed him a paper. ""Put your adress, first and last name, and age on here. We leave in a week to head bak c out, so in a couple of days someone will show up and say if you are drafted or not.""

""Thanks!"" He said after signing the paper.

It was getting dark, so Don and I decided to head home together. We talked about small things like where we might go nest, how long we will continue doing this, and we also talked about other jobs we might want.

I got home and went to my room. It was a long day, so I went to bed shortly after.

I woke up to the sun peering into my room through the window. The house already smelled like blueberry muffins.

""Good moring, sweetie."" my mom greeted.

"" Good morning, Mom. Muffins smell good."" I said.

""Eat up."" She put a plate in front of me with 2 muffins. I devoured them pretty quickly.

At 3 I am meeting Sam for his decison. I hope he decides to do it."" I said.

""Me too. It would be fun for the three of you.""

A little later I took the papers of all the people I have gotten to my boss. He lived right in town. It took me about 10 minutes to get there.

I knocked on his door.

""Hello Luke!"" he said.

""Hey Mr. Kyle. I brought you some more papers of people."" I told him.

""Great!"" I will look through them right now actually."" he exclaimed.

""I might have one more later today also."" I said, getting exited.

""Wonderful. COme back and let me know, alright? he smiled.

""Will do."" I walked back to the sidewalk.

I went to the library, the market, and the barn just to kill time. It eventually became 3, so I walked to the Big Tree. Sam was already there.

""Hey Sam!"" I Greeted him.

""I'll do it!"" he exclaimed.

""Really?"" I asked.

Just think how good you would feel if you knew that you saved people lives just by giving them food. Well i'm going to tell you what it would feel like and why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Just think of becoming a true life hero, you could become a soldier,nurse,doctor, or a Seagoing Cowboy! Seagoing Cowboys were people (men) who transported Cows, Mules, and Horses. They transported them from America to Europe,Greece,and China. Europe was left in ruins after World War || was over, so people signed up to become a Seagoing Cowboy. They would get on ships with 300+ horses, cows, and mues and enough hay and oats to feed them. A Seagoing Cowboy would check up on them every hour to make sure the animals were alright. Wow what a job.

This story is mainly about how great Seagoing Cowboys are and what they bring to other countries. They transported animals to other countries who didn't have food or transportation.

Caring for the animals during the crossing kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holdsof the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. This helps to support the claim that,it can be a lot of work, but it is worth it.

So if you are thinking about joining good,and I thank you. If you are not interested it is okay. Some people might have their own opinion about things. Some may think that is cool,I want to join the group. And others may think that is not the right job for them,or it seems boring. But whatever you are thinking about doing just do it .And that was my introduction to my essay.",2,6,0.6464769840240479

It would also say what he thinks about what he is doing,what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to Europe with his friend. Plus we would of know what he thought about the journey,the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what he felt and thought of it. Did he like it or not. And how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. Of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what he has now.",1,6,0.4527586102485657
e880962,"Have you ever thought about joining the Seagoing Cowboys? If you haven't you definetly should. Just go ask Luke Bomberger. I am going to to be talking about his story and his reasons and stating some of my own. This job will actually make you want to get up in the morning to go to work, it's so awesome. Keep reading to find out my reasons you should definetly join this program.

My first reason is being able to travel to all these different countries and knowing your helping someone in need. This program is to bring animals to countries that need these anamils to survive. We are needing extra help to save all these children and family's in need.

Have you ever thought of wakeing up to see the beautiful bright blue ocean with the the juicy red morning sky right outside on the deck, well you can do this everyday on these long trips. Any shift you are working you get nice things like if you work morning shift you get the beautiful sunrise. While you are working you get all these extra nice things, I'm sure you'll love it.

My third and final reason is, YOU AREN'T EVEN WORKING HALF THE TIME. On the way back ,witch is half the trip, you have no animals to deal with so no work. In the article the author stated, "" Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed."" There so many games you can play even while your on the boat, its a win win for you.

Let's do a recap on why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, my first reason was that you are helping the ones in need. Next I talked about the view you have always wanted when you wake up,it's great. Finally I talked about that half the time you aren't even working. Thankyou for reading my this passage and I hope you think about becomeing a Seagoing Cowboy.",3,6,0.7329755425453186
e8d9d6f,"Do you know what Sea Cowboy is? Well its alot of fun. You should become one just like me. You get to see cool places all around the world, your helping the world, and you will meet lots of new people from different areas of the world. This is a great chance for all people, even teenagers. You will ride a boat with a captain all over the world.

You get to see cool places all around the world like China and Europe. You can explore them too. There are also cool activities you can do in these countries. For example, you could eat there type of food,or go sight seeing, trust me its beautiful. There are lots of things to do when you've arrived at a different country. This is a life changing experience that you might not get a chance to do. This might be your only chance to be a Sea Cowboy.

Your helping the world a bunch by giving other countries horses that they might not have because of a war or natural causes and so on. This helps you become a better person and it helps other countries and the people your giving the horses to. This helps everyone in that country because they might not have a car and there horse died ,and that was there only transpertation and they don't have any horses left that they can buy. If we give them horses, now that family has transpertation again. So this will help others and yourself.

You would meet lots of new people in these countries and you meet your crew. You meet Chinese and Eurpeon people and more. You would learn new languages from all over the world. You could learn lots of things from the people in other countries. For example you could learn there culture and what type of food they eat or even there style of houses. This will stay with you forever in memory. It will be one of the most fun experience you'll ever think about. These people can tell you about there life and what they have been through.

This was surely fun for me but I sadly will have to move on next year. I now that if you do this, you'll be sad when you have to move on too. But you'll remember all the cool places, how you help different countries in the world, and how you meet all those nice people and talked about there background. Trust me this was a experience of a life time. That I and you, would never forget.                     ",3,6,0.7626659274101257

I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is a job opportunity to help take care of animals that are shipped off to other countries that were left in ruins. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, I helped others, took care of animals, and got to go to places all over the world.

The Seagoing Cowboy program has people taking care of animals such as horses young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. When I worked overseas as a Seagoing Cowboy, I served as a watchman on my second trip. On the boat, I checked the animals every hour, and I cracked my ribs. Even though I got hurt, it was a good experience to work on a boat with animals. Along with helping others, you get to see many other esqusite places. I got to see parts of Europe and China, but the most special place I got to see was the Acropolis in Greece. It was also special when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. And these are just a few of the amazing places I've visited! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a lot of work, but it sure is a lot of fun, seeing and learning things from all over the world.

How did I become a Seagoing Cowboy, you asked? Well, my friend Don Reist invited me to go with him on a cattle boat to Europe, and I couldn't say no. It was an opportunity of a lifetime. In Europe, we heard about the UNRRA hiring people to take care of the livestock that was to be shipped to other countries. Don and I signed up. This decision changed my life forever. After I signed up, I got to do many things. That is my story of becomoing a Seagoing Cowboy, and now it's your turn to become one.

Now that you all know about my experience, come and see for yourself how great it is to be a Seagoing Cowboy. There are lots of fun things to do, and lots to learn! Have an adventurous time being a Seagoing Cowboy!",3,6,0.8961856365203857

in a lifetime opportunity. Also that he got to travel and exploer many diffrent

places! Another one of Lukes claim was that he was greatful for the opportunity he got to have by being a seagoing cowboy.

A few reasons to join the club it that you get to go places you probobly never been before. Also that you get to travel all over the world and explore diffrent places and see many diffrent things from many diffrent paces, just like Luke!

It may have taken him two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china but, it may have been worth it because Luke got to see many diffrent things and explore unique stuff! Luke would normally be caring for the animals and so it kept him busy for a long time.The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games so, if you like those games you might want to join them! Being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun than an adventure, it opened the world to Luke. Luke said he was greatful for the opportunity.

"" I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. "" That is what Luke said because he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy and going on all the adventures that Luke got to do! Maybe one day if you become a seagoing cowboy you will be able to adventure all the things Luke got to do. There may

be some rough time like what Luke had when he couldn't work for a few days, for an example,

when he was a watchman and it was a rainy night Luke sliped

and fell and he had a few broken ribs but he was saved by a small strip of metal

along the edge so it stopped Luke from sliding. Luke aws happy to be alive

though! Luckly for Luke he recovered in a few days. Luke was happy to be a cowboy and you might too!

If you become a seagoing cowboy can sometimes lead to bad things like when luck slide on the ship and almost fell of the boat but then was caught by a rope that caught his fall so he was happy to still be alive and happy that he didnt go in to the atlantic ocean and when your on board its sometimes really fun especially on return trips when the animals got unloaded the cowboys play baseball and volley ball games in the empty place that the animals ounce were tabel tenniss,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling and games helped pass the time when the animals were gone.

Luke had two part time jobs one of them was at the grocery store the second one was at the bank, then his friend Don Reist came and told Luke if he want to come with him in a adventure to go to the Europe on a cattle on a boat. So that is when he said to him self ''this could be the moment I had been waiting for in a long time''. They both needed supplies to have a life time. Finally the Seagoing Cowboys were hired by the UNRRA to take good care of the horse, young cows, and also the mules that all of them were shipped overseas. When he was 18 years old he thought it was a good idea to join the military service. He choose to go to the military service before he came to Greece. But he didn't choose to be in the military service. So they still traveled it took two weeks cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eats cost of united state and it also took about a month to get to China. So when are carrying the animals it is harder to travel. But for Luke was more than a adventure it opened up his world into seeing stuff.

e9bdad6,"I think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it will feel great to help animals in need. From my experience of being a Seagoing Cowboys felt amazing because I was able to go to Greece and had a cargo filled with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. I had to feed and water them three times a day. Even though it takes a long time to get from place to place, keeping the animals healthy made me feel happy for me and everbody who participated. That's why I think you should participate in this program.

First, If you become a Seagoing Cowboy it could be fun from time to time. When we were still on a cattle-boat trip, I was able to see Europe and China on the way. Another thing that was fun was that one time me and the crew played volleyball and baseball games where the animals had been housed. Other times we would have table-tennis, fecing, and boxing tournaments to help pass the time. So that may be a thing to enjoy while you are a Seagoing Cowboy.

Next, When you are a Seagoing Cowboy it may open up the world to you like it did to me. From my experience, it made me more aware of people and their needs. So after the long adventure, I had lead my family to host a number of international students and echange visitors for many years. This program had mad me become a better person so, I can help people and their needs. I hope you will do the same too.

Then, when you are a Seagoing Cowboy sometimes it can be intersting but, other times it can be painful. One time when I was being a watchman, I had to watch the animals every hour to make sure they didn't wake up. When I went to make my hourly report to the captain, I had slipped on my backside when I went down a slippery ladder. That day I was lucky to be alive because a small strip of metal stopped me from going into the dark Altantic but I couldn't work due to my cracked ribs. I hope when you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you would not make the same mistake that I did.

Finally, from this huge experience of my life, I had enjoyed it for the most part. From the beginning, I started out as a a simple man then become a Seagoing Cowboy. This is why I highly encouraged you to become a Seaboy Cowboy becuase of all the experiences and fun you can have if you join. Sometimes you can have good times and sometimes you can have bad times, but the impotant part is that you are helping out every country in need.

Luke claims that during his adventures as a Seagoing Cowboy that he gets to visit lots of places when the Seagoing Cowboys go to China, Europe, and many other places. Once he got to see the Acropolis in Greece. Another time when Luke got to go a place in Europe is when he toured an excavated castle in Crete. Luke also got to go to Vencie, Italy and take a gonodola ride. Another fanizitic time Luke got to tour was the Pamama Canol on his way to China. That's why Luke claims during his adventures he got to go many different places as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke also claims that before arriving in Greece he had his eighteenth birthday, which ment he could be drafted by the military. When the draft board learned that Luke was on a cattle-boat trip they made a deal with Luke stating that he could work on a cattle-boat for instead of military service. After two years of cattle-boating Luke was discharged he had the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy he had nine. Thats why Luke claims instead of fighting in the military a person could be a Seagoing Cowboy and bringing animals like horses and cows to people in need acrcoss the sea in Europe, China, or other countires that need help and food after battle or a major war that they lost.

For example when Europe was left in ruins as wll as many other countries the Seagoing Cowboys would help them which I can imagine was a tremendes feeling. People will appreciate you more for helping others. Thats another reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy.

In the story it said that the Seagoing Cowboys went to Greece witha cargo of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them so that they would be healthy which also means that they help the animals too.

It is also great for getting to know others, and learning about different cultures. Another very interesting topic that is brought up when you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys is the sightseeing.

Sightseeing is a great part of these trips. You see, when you get to wherever you are delivering you don't have to do the drop off as well. All you have to do is wait for the sailors but until then you get to look at the attractions. For instance, I saw ""the Acropolis in Greece"" which normally you have to buy plane tickets or boat tickets to get to Greece but when you join you get see these attractions virtually free! I also got to ""take a gondalo ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water!""

But the most important part is helping others.

Helping others is the whole reason you should sign-up. You are doing somethining good, not for your self, but for the world, or a specific part of the world anyway. You are also stepping out of your way to help others, you will be rewarded for what you did on Earth in heaven. You will probably, unknowingly save lives while doing this. Helping people is actually good for our brains, it makes us more satisfied with ourselves and we become happier, healthier, and more fun to be around!

You may be thinking we shouldn't go because we like our lives here. Well step outside your comfort zone, stand up for those people who need us, and be the man that says ""I will go and help these people!""

So, in conclusion you should come and join SeaGoing Cowboys and help us help others, see amazing things, and just have a good time! Come and let us save people, have a good time ourselves, and see wonders beyond our home!",4,6,0.7530778646469116

In the text it states ""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water"". The text also states But seeing the Acropolis Greece was special.""This shows unique places that the Cowboys have gone.

Second, . There is so much to explore and to the adventure were long and tiring. In the text it states that ""It took about two weeks to crosss the Alantic ocean from the easterncoast of the United States and a month to get to China"". The text also states that ""Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. The excitment with adventures comes with bravery. This shows adventures that the Cowboys have gone through.

The trip may be to care for the animal when they're on board with us but, it's a great,once in a lifetime,opportunity. Let me tell you some facts that may convince you to join.

You may be onboard to care for the animals,like cleaning the stalls,but there is more to it then just that. When you stop somewhere to drop off the animals, you get to sightseeing.When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, I had the benefit of seeing Europe,China,Venice,Italy,and even the Acropolis in Greece. I saw a excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I went over sea for weeks at a time. Even though the trip was long, it was amazing to see the sights,care for the animals,and,after the animals left,play games like volleyball and baseball in the animal's stalls.

Well,you may have thought that was amazing to hear about, it's better to go and do the adventure for yourself. There are more reason that you should join but,maybe I should let you go join if you let you sign up if you want to. If I haven't conviced you yet, then maybe Seagoing Cowboys may not be for you. I just hope you try to do Seagoing Cowboys and if you don't want to,you don't have to. Well,that's all I have to say,other then, join the Seagoing Cowboys!",3,6,0.8561986684799194

Sign up right now and help lots of people and have the experience of a life time. You will get to learn about the animals and take care of them, have lots of fun, and experience many unique places.

First of all, you get to take care and learn about the animals there. Some people might not like the fact that you have to stay in a boat several weeks with the animals. But after taking care of them and feeding them its not that bad and they become your friends. I had to feed them and water the animals two or three times a day. The stalls where the horses were kept also had to be cleaned. Not only do you learn to take care of the animals but you also learn responsibility.

Secondly, you have a lot of fun. I get that some people think being stuck in a boat isn't fun at all. Some of the most fun was when the animals were unloaded so the return is one of the funnest parts. The cowboys played many games and sports where the animals were housed. They would have volleyball games, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, all which helped pass time. Go try it, who doesnt like an advanture, and some new friends?

Lastly, you get to experience so many unique places. I understand that some people might not want to leave their home. But, I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China. Another one of the coolest things was the Acropolis in Greece. I got to do many things like taking a gondola ride in Venice, Itay a city with streets of water. I saw many things and went to lots of places just imagen everywhere you could go and everything you would discover if you gave it a chance.

You get to learn about different animals and take care of them, have lots of fun, and experience many unique places. Sign up and have a great time maybe even the time of your life.

ec10c42,"Being a sea cow boy is an amazing experince, if you want to be a sea cowboy you might just be in for a suprise.

I think a good reason to become a Sea Cowboy is that you get to see great things. During my time a Sea Cowboy I travel many places. In 1947, I got to go on a journey to Europe and China, and for me that was an amazing experince. Eurpe and China were great, but I think some of my specialist experinces were when I travled to Acropolis in Greece, and when I took a gondola ride in Vienice italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marvled at Panama Canal on my way to China.

Another reason I enjoyed being a Sea Cowboy were the things I got to do in my free time. In my free time sometimes I would keep busy by taking care of the animals. I had to feed them, (they had to be fed two or threee times a day) and stalls had to be cleaned. (helping out on my aunt katies farm prepared me for that) To have fun on board Sea Cowboys played baseball and volleyball, and sometimes even table-tennis tournements, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling to pass the time.

One of my favorite things about be a Sea Cowboy was helping people. On my journeys I helped people in Europe who had fallen in World War II, and that brought joy to my heart

In my opinion being a Sea Cowboy is a fun filled experince with fun, journeys, chances to help people, and an opprotunity of a lifetime.                                                ",3,6,0.7870954275131226

Being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't always hard work and non-stop rushing around all the time. Usually on the trip back when you dont have animals to care for it is super fun. You can wittle, play table tennis, box, read, or play any other game. It is still hard work but it can still be fun. When we take trips back I love it because we all hang out and play games.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see many different places. It is a big opportunity that is very rare. You can see beautiful places such as China, Italy, New Orleans, The Acropolis in Greece, or just see places on the way there like the Panama Canal. It costs a lot of money to just make one of those trips. This way you can see all of those places without spending a dime.

A Seagoing Cowboy is a great way to help other people in need.

It will feel really good when you are on the trip back and you know in your mind that you just helped a city or a country with their problems. Yes you have all of the things you need to live but helping someone else who has nothing really makes you feel good. After that you can go and think to your self I could have just saved a starving child or family.

So in the end I believe you should be a Seagoing Cowboy because it is fun, you can travel to new places, and it makes you feel good. I really hope that you will become a Seagoing Cowboy.

First why do was a seagoing cowbiy is becuase that he was a heardworking cowboy Don his best friend was the one who Invited him to to go on a cattel boat in Europe. And luke just couldn't say no. At that time many contries were left in the ruins. so he sined up for a seagoing cowboy so it was his best friend Don that made his dream come true

Second why they chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that it is a bone breaking job.So they joined this program becuse they could help the contries that were left in the ruins. This is one reason why people shold perticapate in the UNRRA, And people should join the UNRRA becuase People could help the earth be a better place by giving the people food, or milk a dairy cow.

last why he chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that he is strong I think luke's claim is that this is not an easy task Becuse you will get hurt. The text states"" a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlanic"" This shows that you might be left with a few broken bones, Just a few right?

Acropolis in Greece, went on a gondola ride in Venice Italy, toured a excavated castle in Crete.

Another reason you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because if you love horses, cows,or mules you get to work with them and take care of them all day. You will surely be kept busy, they have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats have to be pulled up frim the lower holds.

Not only do you take care of the animals, you also help people in need for the animals for food, and milk. You will also get to experience adventures and vist unique places from all around the world.

2.

Lets say it can be boring on the boat the whole time after the animals are gone, but you will still have alot of fun. When the animals are gone; the room that they were in can be turned into a game room were you can play vollyball, table tennis, read, fencing, boxing and many other things. All of these games will help pass the time, and make it seem like a week journey and not a month journey.

3.

One thing to be careful about is the dangers that could happen. You could fall off the boat and into the sea,or if a storm hit the big waves could drown you. Always remember to be prepared and always be careful while on the ship at all times. Do not play around and walk on the railings of the boat, or then you will fall off the boat.

ee94fa4,"Segoing Cowboys is a good program that I think everybody should join. In the program, you can do things that a cowboy usually does, but you can also do other fun things. Here are some other reasons for you to join.

If you like animals, this job is for you. One of the main reasons this program started was to help countries with animals, and that is a fauna-lover's dream. Another reason is that you can see the different sights in other coutries. The sights are absolutely amazing! You will be able to see the beautiful sunset on the sea and there is pretty much nothing prettier than that. But, if that hasn't changed your minds about not going, then this certainly will.

Some people say that seafaring is dangerous, or that you will not make it out alive if the ship sinks. First of all, there is absolutely no way that you will get killed on the ship, and second, there is about a fourteen million to one chance that the ship will sink, because our captain is the best in the world. Another reason you might not want to go is because you might get seasick. I don't think that is a very good reason to ot go, because one, you will get over it and two, the only reason anyone ever threw up on the ship is because he was watching The Exorcist an eating clam chowder. But that is a different story for a different time, so we'll be moving on.

Please consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. It helps people out, you can see sights, and it will be the best memory of your entire life. You will always be helping somebody, no matter what. ",3,6,0.815009593963623

Also so if you want to you can help out animals in the passage it said, the animals had to drink two or three times a day also a way you can help you could clean the stalls on the ship and they will give you jobs and other stuff and so you won't think it is boring you can have fun onboard to they got a lot of things like baseball,and volleyball and the house it is table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and the games make time go fast and that's why I think you should join the seagoing Cowboys program.",2,6,0.8718599677085876

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds were animals had been housed. Tabled-Tennis tournements, fencing, boxing, reading whittling, and games also helped pass the time."" Another thing is that ""

It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Nations Relif and Rehabilitation Asmmintration). UNRRA hired "" Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke and Don signed up."" Finally "" It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to be fed watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be clean.""

I think being apart of this program would be a awesome opportunity because not alot of people could do this and be apart of a program. You also get to see really cool things like antique artifacts,really old buildings,and diffrent lifestyles. This would be so much fun because you can learn how other people live their lifes in different countries,and explore places you never thought you would even go to. You could also see different cultures and try their kind of food they eat every day,and see how people in different countries go about their everyday lifes.

I think this could be a life changing oppotunity for people. This is a awesome thing to do because it is not an everyday thing for most people to be apart of.",2,6,0.6909003853797913

There is no better job than this! When you are a doctor you have to be extremely careful and have to watch people suffer, a construction worker has to work al day long, a cashier has to sit and wait for people to buy something, but here we help thousands of people and animals while having fun! I have no idea why anyone would out down a job like this! It doesn't even feel like work! You can learn so many good things and meet new people, you can see amazing structures and even explore them! One time I went into a broken down castle and found the coolest stuff. We have gone to the Panama Canal, Italy, and many more amaxing locations.

I think that more people should help because it is for a good cause and we need more people. Another reason as to why I say that is because it can be better pay than most jobs and believe it or not can be fun. You may be thinking how is it fun to be in a ship for months and weeks at a time, well on the way back when there are no animals in the storage area that we keep them in we can play games like Baseball,Volleyball,Table Tennis,Fencing,and Boxing.

Also, you get a great opportunity to see famous buildings,cities,structures,and landmarks like for example I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, I have taken a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy (which was like a city with streets full of water), and the Panama Canal and many more.

If you decide to join i would be very glad and hope to meet you there just rember all of the opportunity you may have there and you may be saving peoples lives. Also, are you working at a place that doesn't pay good thsi would be better because you can be away at sea for awhile and have no bills you would have food provided and water.

Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist had seen many of these places and many more.

In August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. ""We arrived August 14,"" Luke says, ""the day the Pacific war ended."" They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece---with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. ""When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle---boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips---the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

efc5b01,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program that can benefit you and others. The Seagoing Cowboys help people all over the world by taking care of the animals getting shipped over seas, to the countries that were let in ruins after World War ll. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy lets you help others, but have some fun at the same time.

In paragraph 2 of the article, it states ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" The Seagoing Cowboys get to help the cites in ruins by taking care of the animals being sent overseas.

In paragraph 5, Luke says that he not only gets to help people, but he gets to go sight-seeing in different countries. He go to see the Acropolis in Greece, and took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. He also go to tour an excavated castle in Crete and see the Panama Canal on his way to China. In paragraph 8, the article states that Luke especially enjoyed the return trips. ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy would also help you learn how to work hard. In paragraph 6, the article tells the readers that it takes two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean, and one month to get to China. In that time, you have to feed the animals and give them water two to three times a day. Hay bails and bags of oats have to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship, and stalls have to be cleaned.

In conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would benefit not only you, but others around the world. You will learn how to work hard, but have some fun. The Seagoing Cowboy program might open you to the world, like it did to Luke, and it might not.

One of the reasons that everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that we get to go and travel to a lot of places.

Yes,you'd be helping people and their ruined countries,but you'd be on an adventure! Luke went to Europe,Greece,China,and other exotic places. He toured castles and took fun rides on rivers or canals. He got to interact with animals to and from the places he went to. He also ofcourse got to interact with the people of these far away lands.

Now it's not just a bunch of fun and games. You have to do a lot of work. You would have many farm animals to take care of. Horses,cows,pigs,and goats. They need to be groomed,fed,watered,and watched over. Sometimes you'd have to stay up all night to watch over the animals.

I'm not saying you won't have any time to yourself on the boat. when you go to pick up the animals you can read,play baseball,or tennis in a lower deck or you could take long cat naps.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy you get to help people, and save them to. Maybe some of their houses got destroyed, or maybe then don't have enough supplies top trade care of themselves and their loved ones. Well being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to do this for people all around the world. You would definitely be able to meet new people and I think you would have a lot of fun. During 1945 many countries were left in ruins. Wouldn't you love to go help those people find food, find or build a shelter for them, and more? This would be an all around great experience.

In this experience of a life time you would also be able to travel around the world. Wouldn't traveling around the world seem fund? You be Abel to learn so much, like, maybe a new language, or some new facts that maybe you didn't know about that country. You would be able to learn about cultures and have a new experience. Being able to travel around the world would be amazing. Even through you are still doing work you would still get some free time too. It's now just work.

Even though you will be working most of the time, you can not just work, you have to have fun with it. Like you get to see animals and stay with them on the ship. Like when you have the shift to watch over the animals, you get to see them and check on them. Maybe even pet them. Ther could be all sorts of animals on the ships. Who's knows it a surprise.

Also other things you can do is do your chores on the ship like cleaning the stalls where the animals stay, feeding the animlas, and watering the animals. Those are just more reasons why you should become a Seagoing Coyboy.

After you read all of this I hope you decide to become a Seagoing Coyboy. Now you know how this choice is going to be adventure filled, an amazing experience for helping people, and what the things you get to do on the ship.

f2427df,"I was getting lonely on board with the normal crew all day everyday. I had an idea to try and see if some of my friends would want to help me with my job as a Seagoing Cowboy. with my luck some of them said, ""Yeah sure!"", but some of them were too busy. I asked the captain if I could invite some of my friends so I could have more fun, and so we could get more work done on the boat.

The captain thought about it for a little while, and to my surprise he said yes! I was so happy that my friends and I could see Europe together! This all started because my friend Dan Reist invited me to help. A few days later me and my friends were helping out on the boat. Also we were playing games to pass the time. We had to make sure that the animals were safe, secure, and fed.

We all had a spendid time. We could be together until we got all of the countries back to normal, or even better! We could still help people even if we were done helping countries back to normal. I still chose to help people. It was the right thing to do, and most of my friends helpped, too.",2,6,0.6388218402862549
f24da7f,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rides the Waves"" a young adult named Luke signs up for a program that is called the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" that take care of horses, young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys do this because countries that were destroyed need them for travel and food. Now here are three reasons why Luke decided to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Luke signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys because it was an opportunity of a life time. That means that he would not get anymore chances to travel on a boat around the world. This is also a big opportunity mostly because he is a farm boy from a small town. In paragraph 5 and 1 it states ""... Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy, but besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China..."" Also Luke wanted to join because he got to help countries that were damaged from the war. In the two sentences that were right before the first paragraph (the ones that help explain the story a little bit) it states "" Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II (or WWII for short).""

The last reason that Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys was because he got to be with animals. In paragraph 7 it states "" Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm had prepared Luke for the hard work..."" So that means that if he worked on a farm with a lot of animals, and he joins something with animals, that means he likes animals. Also in paragraph 1 it states "" ... Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat."" So that would mean that he wants to travel with animals in a baot or he wants to be in a boat filled with animals because he like animals (this story is kind of reminding me about Noah's Arch, you know the one with the boat filled with animals because there was a giant flood).

So those are the reasons why Luke desided to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Remember he joined because he wanted to help countries that were damaged or destroyed in the World War II, it was an opportunity of a lifetime for him because he is a farm boy, and because he got to be with animals. That is why Luke joined the program.",4,6,0.7764735221862793
f275c1c,"Do you want to join the Seagoing cowboys and dnt know what they do or how many months they'll be gone? i think that everyone should join the seagoing cowboys because in 1945 world war ll was over in eroupe. The seagoing cowboys flew thwir si they could get their food stores back in order because everything waas tore down from the war. You should join because it helps other people and if you're a person who likes to help other people in their time of need then seagoing cowboys is good for you.

Its shows you that not everyone has what you have. That people struggle sometimes for food. The seagoing helps them get their aniamls back their animals back or their houses either because they got tooken away or because somebody burned their houses down. Its a very good program to be in because it helps you learn things about other contries. You get to travel the world and hep people in their time of need. You get to explore the world and explore what sycitey is now. How the world is falling apart, Wars that shoot up houses and food so everyone can starve besides the people who started the war.",2,6,0.8557698726654053
f285fe2,"I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program!

You can help people and animals recover their food supply. You also have time to look around at places you've never seen before.

Like Luke, he says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable oppotunity."" Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice,

Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. If you were to be a Seagoing Cowboy, you could have all these benefits too.

On return trips you can have fun by playing some games, like baseball and volleyball games. They also played Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

It can be a great adventure for you, but it can also open up the world to you just like it did for Luke. It changed Luke's life, and it can change your life too.",2,6,0.8353619575500488
f2c95f1,"Think about it, people all over the world are constantly getting themselves stuck in natural disasters losing lots of the things they need to survive. In passage 2 it says, "" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more''.

All this does is help recover families who have lost family members animals or shelter. most of the people cant survive without their food. Being a seagoing cowboy can be more than helping families but can spread the love and hope of God. In passage 9 it sais "" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him."" Im grateful for the opportunity'' he says.""

Now think if you were in this situation, wouldnt you want to have hope, know someone cares, restore the broken. It would also be challenging to try to live without food no to animals to even rely on for food. Think of someoneyou love, think about if they died. wouldnt you want people to come contfor you. It would also just be a fun experience getting to see new places if not before.

In conclusion if you wouldnt like to loose family, friends, or animals you rely on or just love come help those who have went through those times. Why dont you show those people that you care and want to help. So now what do you think about joinging UNRRA.   ",2,6,0.747813880443573

Traveling is a big part of this amazing program, you get to see so many many historic sites and arcitecture. Being able to cross the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean by boat is pretty cool.

After world War II ended many countries were ruined to help fix this 44 nations joined together to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).

This is the program made for people who love animals. There are always cows or horses on board that are being rescued.

There is always work to be done as well. So, if your strong and like to work that could be a plus. Haybales and grain always need brought up from lower holds of the ship. Stalls always need cleaned and there is always work to be done. Sometimes you can catch a break on the way to another port and then you can relax.

Cowboys help people with nothing.

How do these people end up with nothing you may ask, well when a country is in a war and their country gets destroid the citizens have nothing at all to go back to but rubble.

The UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) gets involved with broken countries by rebiulding.

They use us Seagoing Cowboys to bring the needed cattle from other countries by boat.

We travel by sea with hundreds of horses and other needed aniamals.

They are given the job of feeding the aniamals three times a day as well as giving them water and cleaning the pens.

Also we are tasked with night watch, in paragraph seven it tells us this can be a dangerous.

But the danger is worth it when you think of all the joy the days on boat have.

When the animals are gone we play games where the cattle were held. Another up side would be that you are not only serving your country but your serving someone else's as well.

The boat rides to the cattle's destination is worth the our time as well.

The sight seeing is amazing wherever you go whether it be Itily or China, there are great things you can see.

According to the passage, ""It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China."" and it also states: ""I also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been reloaded,"" This explains why you could have a lot of freetime on board.

The last reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, is because you get to be with animal on board. Now, I know if you're a cowboy, you love animals, so this is a good time to learn about an animal's behavior and learn more about the animal. According to the excerpt, it states: ""UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration) hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas,"" This explains how you get a lot of free time with animals.

With these reasons, the Seagoing Cowboy program is a great place. You should join because of these three reasons, I have explained why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The reasons why you should join are because you get to travel and see beautiful things like nature, you get a lot of free time with yourself and new friends, and you get to be with animals.

it is a good program to do. If you like farm animals, and taking care of them. Then you will really like this job. Be careful not to get hurt. Make sure you take good care of the animals.

The program is fun you get to travel around the world. This job is a one in a life time chance and I like every one will enjoy this job. A lot of people that like those things would be good or great at being a Seagoing Cowboy. I know I enjoy it, so I think you will like it to. You will have lots of fun.

If you are a farmer or you help take care of farm animals then this would be an easiy and fun job for you. If you do it or ever do the job you should encaurage other friends and family to do Seagoing Cowboys.

Be careful and do not get hurt. I smashed my ribbs during a storm, and about went over board. It was scarie and I was glad to still be alive. When storms come make sure you stay in a safe place. I think if you do this job you should always be careful not to slip or trip over anything in the way while feeding the animals.

Take good care of all the animals aboard the ship. Feed and water them all two or three times a day. When you feed them make sure they have a hay and oats or grain.

You will mostly have younger cows and mules on the ship but you will have other animals to. Their will be a few horses because they are going to the World War II and the UNRRA.

These are the reason why I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. This is a one in a life time chance and I know you will like it. ",2,6,0.7955788373947144

So, Seagoing Cowboys, which are a part of the UNRRA, travel back and forth on a boat that carries a cargo of about 300 horses and enough food to feed them. This is a tough job for just a few guys becasue the animals need food, water, and their stalls had to be cleaned.

If you were a Seagoing Cowboy you would have alot of amazing opportunitys. In the story Luke states in paragraph five "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing China and Europe. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

You would also get to help people. You would get to take things that families need to them. Lastly, you could also have fun! On the way back when you don't have any cargo, you play or do fun activites. You could play baseball or volleyball where all of the animals where at on the way to your destination. Also you could box, fence, read, and have table-tennis tournaments.

Some people say they would not want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because of the long trip, but if you were doing fun activites such as reading, boxing, fencing, playing baseball, and taking care of the animals time would pass by. You also have the opportunity to see many new things. You could see China and Greece and lots of other countries. They also don't want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because they think you don't do much, but you get to take care of the animals and play games.

Number two is that I get to help people who were affected by war. I was eighteen when I joined the orginization, so that meant I could be drafted for war at any time. This made me feel me feel worried, but then I went to Greece and I every thing was okay. Now enough about me I am here to encourage you to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

You should join the program. It feels great to know that you are making a difference in somebody's life. Plus, like I said there are a lot of cool sights to see. I have been to nine different places. I saw something amazing in each place out of the nine. You can try all new different things. Like new food, new music, new sports, new almost everything. Now I know what you are thinking that is crazy how am I supposted to adjust to something so quickly that is impossible, but trust me it is not as hard as is sounds.

f65f855,"Joining the Seagoing Cowboys group was one of the most greatest accomplishments I have ever made. If you choose to do something in your life, it should be becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. I have some very good points on why you should join.

The first and main reason is this program helps people. It supports people's horses, young cows, and mules, since this program is for those who are struck by natural disasters or for wars that have taken place where they live. It also supports the animals living space. The cowboys must feed and water the animals 2 to 3 times a day, the men have to haul oats and hay from the lower holds of the ship, and they have to clean the animals stalls.

the second reason is that if you turn 18 while on a Seagoing trip and you get drafted, this counts as your service to the military.

The last reason is when you are going to these countries you have these gorgeous and unique places to visit and sightsee. I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the streets of Italy from the lake on a gondola ride, and I have even seen the Panama Canal on my way to China.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy then you can experience and support all three of these reasons.",3,6,0.8712903261184692

Lukes claims are that he got to see things he never saw before. He was able to nine sea trips around the world.

Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Luke had alot of things to see on his trip, he got to see Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal. Luke also had a chance to take a ride a gondola in Venice and Italy.

This was a great opportunity for Luke to help people all around the world. By

One big reason to join is that you get to explore the world. This is a job where you take animals across was to different countries. I myself visited many countries and loved it. You get to see such beatiful sights while getting paid.

Another reason is its fun. As I mentioned before you go to such wonderful places. Plus, when the ship returns from one destination the shipmate have fun completions the while time, and when you are at whatever place you are you can visit anywhere and have fun anywhere. All while being payed.

One of my favorite reasons is that you help people. Being a Seagoing Cowboy means that you help people. You give to countries in need. Not only do you help them, you also help yourself. I never realized the need of other countries before a became a Seagoing Cowboy. I just love to give other countries animals that are in need.

I hope i will see you in the future. May this be your opprotunity to change someone's life .

One of the most enjoyable things to do is go sitesee. It really makes time fly by so much quicker . I've beenn doing this for what now,2years? And i've already been on 9 trips! Though sitseeing is not the only thing we do we trasport animals to country's in need . So far it's been a huge success and we don't want to look back, not yet.

There are there flaws though it's kinda hard to be constantly on the move with a spouse or heck maybe kids too just at home. So, why not bring them with you i'm pretty sure we would have more then enough things for you children to do. Remeber this is a very serious and dangerous job . I've gotten through a only one bad injury where I broke a rib .(paragraph7). That will be very unlikely to happen though considering none of my parteners have ever had that happen to them.

This proggram is run by UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). They hired me to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. I think you should join this program and help me.

Right away you will notice you can go so many places! If you are a small town boy going on cattle-boat trips, you're in for such a treat. You could possibly go to Europe and China and explore all day. You even get to go to the most special place ever, Acropolis and Greece! Maybe in Greece you'll find yourself at an age old theatre. You could go take a gondola ride in Vence, Italy, a city with streets of water. I got to tour an excavated castle and marveled at the Panama Canel on my way to China.

You may ask yourself,

""How am I suppose to have fun and pass time on board? Its very easy actually, especially on return trips from when the animals have already been unloaded. We all played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. All the time on the boat you can find something to do. You always have time to sight-see while you're on it. You also have time for table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games helped us pass some time.

Even for all the work that had to be done, it wasn't that bad. You had lots of time for sight-seeing since it took a lot of time to get to one place to another. Caring for animals during the crossings kept us busy. It just kept us busy, it wasn't very hard. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lowers holds of the ship. Plus, stalls had to be cleaned. All of this wasn't bad at all, you just had to get use to the routine of it.

You will get a one in a lifetime chance while spending time overseas, traveling to new countries, and spend all of that time with horses, young cows, and mules. Not only are you going to travel to new places, you will also see many different sights you may never see again. After a hard day at sea caring for different animals you can play games, have a variety of different sports tournaments, or just play rounds of games such as basketball or volleyball.

While most people don't call fun feeding and watering horses, there is much more to being a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" that just that. After your turn to feed or water that animals is over, board games or even just playing with a deck of cards are options. After you get off of the ship there are hundreds of activities and tourists attractions in the different countries such as Greece, China, Crete, and many more places all around the world that you can see and do. In Crete there are ancient Greek castles in ruins, in Greece you can see the Acropolis (which was a very special occasion for me). I even took a gondala ride in Venice, Italy. Doing this job has many benefits other than just helping horses and other animals.

On top of all of those reasons for being fun, I also had a great time spending time with the animals. Doing this job isn't as simple as it sounds though. I had to know when you need to feed or water the animals (which is two to three times a day) and I also had to make sure they didn't get sick on the voyage. On top of that you also have to carry the hay and oats for 335 different animals onto the ship. But, although it's not easy, it still was a lot of fun for me and I'm guessing it was also fun for the other people that went on the trip too. I enjoyed this job so much, I did it nine times because it was so much fun. I enjoyed doing it so much I did it the most out of anyone, and I think you will too.

The final reason I think you will enjoy doing this is because this trip is a one in a lifetime opportunity. Some people have never been on an airplane, some people have never been on a boat, but this is different. This is more than just a family vacation. This is an opportunity do something different. This is a chance to go do something most people have never done before.

It does take a lot of time to be a Seagoing Cowboy, but it is so worth it. I am filled with gratitude for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people and other counrtries. I now host a number of international students and exchange visitors.""

I hope you enjoyed that message from Luke. I aslo hope it inspired you to join the UNRRA.                                                               ",2,6,0.8626421689987183
f8cc34f,"The jouneys of being a Seagoing Cowboy aren't always easy.

The waves toss your boat, and the animals are not easy to handle, but the joy you feel when you help people who are in need, all of the rough times are worth it.

On the sea, you are able to help people by loading your boat with cattle, horses, and many other animals, because the people are in need of these animals.

When you deliver these animals to places such as Greece, Europe, China, Crete, Italy, and many more exotic countries, you are able to see the amazing artifacts that are located in these places.

While sailing on the Atlanic Ocean, you encounter different oceanic animals.

When you are able to see their beauty in person, ot helps you appreciate different life forms.

You also appreciate your own life becuase you realize that people are less fortunate, and you are blessed to be able to help them.

You see the uneducated, and you want to help.

While continuing your journey as a Seagoing Cowboy, you become aware of all the problems in the world.

After I served my time as a Seagoing Cowboy, the awareness stayed with me, and I lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

I share knowledge of the sea, and the students become aware of the problems and want to make a difference.

You learn to cherish the people who are around you, because at any given moment, something bad, or good can happen.

On one rainy night, I was serving as a watchman and after I made my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a ladder, and landed on my back.

My heart was racing as I slipped toward an opening if the ship.

A small strip of metal caught me and I was relieved to be alive, but in pain at the same time.

I cracked my ribs but rhe crew, my friends, cared for me when no one else could.

These are the dangersof the sea, but the rush you get when you see the less fortunate people smile, the dangers shrink to the size of a pencil shaving.

If you do not appreciate helping people, the oceanic life, friendship, learning, and teaching, once you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you will, and always appreciate these traits.  ",3,6,0.7602108120918274

Luke didn't know what to say, because it was an opportunity of a life time. So he decided to go, they were to go overseas to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. In 1945 they recieved there orders to New Orleans and they arrived August 14, 1945. Eventually, they headed to Greece with 335 horses also with eniugh hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned the age 18 before arriving to greece which meant he could be ready to participate for military service. When they learned he was on a cattle boat they told me to keep doing what I was doing. Luke had made 9 trips, more than any Seagoing Cowboy ever. It was an amazing opportunity for Luke, he loved visiting ancient things. Luke didn't just have to me stuck in a boat with horses he got to also go out and adventure. It took 2 weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean, from the eastern coast of the United States. Also another month to get china, this seems like hard work. But the animals kept Luke busy, they had t be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay had to be pulled from ship to feed them. Luke had some experience by helping on Katies farm as a boy. On lukes second trip at a Seagoing Cowboy, he was to be night watchman his had to check on the animals every hour. A rainy night he had to go down a ladder, his feet slipped then a small trip of metal caught him from tumbling of the boat. He was happy to be alive, even with a few cracked ribs so he couldnt work for a couple days. Luke always had fun on board though. He got to play games which would make time go faster. Games such as volleyball, baseball, tennis and more. Being a Seagoing cowboy wasnt just an adventure he had fun to and the world open up to him. It made him aware of many opportunities.

Luke liked Greece and the other places so much is in Greece he liked Acropolis. He liked the other places but Greece was his favorite. He also went on nine trips! The most of any Seagoing Cowboys.

Reason he joined the pregram was becuase Luke's friend Don Reist Invited him to go to Europe and Luke could not Reject that. Luke knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime in Paragraph 1. Another reason was In World War II was over Europe to sned animals, food supplies, and more to recover countries. Luke and Don sign up for that. Lukes point of veiw is that Luke had some amazing adventures and its pretty awesome to see around the world and helping other people.

In paragraph 8 it states that Luke also found some fun time on board so it states to you Luke had some fun times and some scary times in his view.

Then you would also have to lift all that straw and bags of oat around the boat. You would have to clean up after them. I have 2 cats and I have to clean up after them and lift the bags of cat food. Boy let me you it is a hard job. But the worse part of taking care of my cats is when they get sick all over the floor.

So I dont really see why taking care of 100 some horses would be fun. unless you like horses. Then you would be working on the boat durring a war. that would be dangeras. Plus you would never be home to see your familay unless they came with you. But that probly wouldnt be allowed.

What if you get sea sick? Or a horse gets sick and spreds it around to the other horses? What if the boat springs a leak? A lot of lives will be at risk. Plus what if an animal that you are alergic to comes on the ship? What if the engine breaks and you cant move? Or you run out of food? What would you do? or if the lights quit working while your in the fog or its nigh, and your right in the middle of an ice berg feild? that would be a very rogh time. Or if some one needs medical attention what would you do? or if the caption got sickand it spreded around to the other crew members?

that would be a verytough time. Plus there would be noone to feed the horses becus evrey one would be to weak.

Who knows, you might end up liking it. Half of the people that read this probaly won't care but be the half that dose care. So, Let me tell you my reasons why you should try it.

First i think it is a fun oppratuinity to try. How often do you get offard this or even hear about it. Just like they said in the strory he couldn't say no because it was an opportunity of a life time. They said he traveled all around the world. I think that would be awesome and fun to try.

Next i think it would be fun to be around all of those animals. I understand that some people don't care about animals or anything that i have to say. I know some people get sea sick or are afraid of boats or sailing. I think that holds you back to much in life to have a fear like that. I think people should get out and try something new.

Last i think that it would be fun and exciting to travel around the world. To see all the sights and accient things. Even thought you have to be a ceartian age to do some stuff,well some stuff you don't need to be a ceartian age. I guess it depends on your udea of fun. But to say you have been there to something you see on TV or in the paper, would be cool when most of the people you know haven't.

Those are my reasons why i think it would be a fun thing to try. You get to see the sights and the animals. I hope more people take into consideration of trying something new most of the time.

The adventure that we go on are eye opening. Helping around the places we go are very fun but can also dangerous . Even though your on a boat or ship you can find fun in spare time.

There are also benefits of going places around the world like Europe and China. Other places that benefits you is Greece you can see the Acropolis, and more.

fc17862,"Have you ever thought of being part of the great union of the Seagoing Cowboys? There are many reasons to be one, like the fact that you have intereaction with livestock, get to visit unique places, sail the oceans, and much more.

Seagoing Cowboys are people who sign up to the UNRRA. The UNRRA is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It is 44 nations joined together to help the countries in need from being left in the ruins after World War II. Being a Seagoing Cowboy also counts as a military service.

While being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to take care of all of the livestock that is getting shipped across the ocean from one country to another. The animals have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. The animals need to be fed either hay or bags of oats, and every once in a while their stalls need to be cleaned.

One of the best things you get to do is sightseeing. You could get to have many trips and see many cool things. We do a lot of sailing on the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. In total I've been on the Atlantic 16 times and the Pacific twice. Don't even get me started on the unbelievable cattle-boat trips. For a small-town bot like i was it was incredible. I got to visit the Acropolis in Greece, sightsee in Europe, touran excavated castle in Crete, ride a gondola in Venice, and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't just about the travel and sightseeing. We still had fun on board, especially on the return trips when the animals had been uploaded and their stalls were empty. We would enjoy playing baseball, volleyball, table-tennis games. We would also play fencing and boxing matches. Last but not least we enjoyed reading, whittling, and other small games to pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was not only fun for me, but it also opened up the world in a whole different perspective. It also made me more aware of other countries problems and needs. With that experience my family was a host to a number of international students, and exchange visitors or many years.

I loved my experience as being a Seagoing Cowboy, and I hope you will too. Welcome aboard future Seagoing Cowboy!",4,6,0.8379799723625183

The day the Pacific war ended I set out on my first trip, which was to Greece with 335 horses, and if you like spending a lot of time with animals, it takes two weeks to cross the pacific, and to go to China it'll take a month. So, if you enjoy to spend time with animals you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to have a lot of fun and do a lot of site-seeing. As a Seagoing Cowboy I always found a way to have fun. We would have baseball and volleyball games, we would have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, we would even enjoy boxing, reading, and even whittling. And to top it all off we saw a lot of amazing sites. We would go all over Europe and China. I have personally visited Greece, China, seen the Panama Canal, and have even toured an excavated castle in Crete. Even though there might be long excruciating trips, we still find ways to have fun.

There are many upsides of being a Seagoing Cowboy. I have only told you a few of the many, many advantages of being a Seagoing Cowboy. So, after all of this I hope you consider joining me on the high seas. ",3,6,0.8272882103919983

UNRRA also known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas.

The Seagoing Cowboys had recieved their orders to repot to New Orleans. They had arived August fourteenth. When they got the seaman's papers they boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece. Their cargo was full of 335 horses plus tons of hay and oats to feed them.

Luke had been given a great opportunity for a small-town boy. It took the Seagoing Cowboys two weeks to get acroos the the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke kept busy by feeding and treating the animals on the cattle boat.

And at the end Luke says that he is grateful for the opportunity that he had to get on and ride that cattle boat. This concludes to my opinion that you don't have to always be someone special to get good things.",1,6,0.7083765268325806

Hellow my name is Luke and im going to tell you the many reasons to be a ¨Seagoing Cowboy¨.First, of all it allows you to go to many countrys that you may not get to afford to go to,and you get to tour if you have spare time to see many historical features like battle grounds. You may even get to see festivals and help thousands of people at the same time. If you have time after you did all the chores for the day you may be able to play games like baseball,volleyball,table-tennis tournaments and boxing but their is not just that theirs lots more to do.

Next, you may find time to go danceing or discover may cultures. You can eat new foods learn new games and spend well earned money on clothing and furniture. If your on your way home maybe you can fish or go sight seeing. If you get lucky you may be able to see the watery streets of Italy or Greece. To me the ¨Seagoing cowboys¨ program helped me see a lot I didnt know existed. These are the many reasons I went and loved the ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ program.      ",2,6,0.7353464365005493

The ship may fall over and you may have a ship wreak.

You are going to paces that are danaged from the war and the soliders there might not know that the war is over and they could shot you.

Even though there are many ways that you could get hurt or killed you will still have lots of fun on your trip across the world and back.

being a seagoing cowboy is much more than an adventure it is also a lot of work. you will also find time to have fun,especially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The UNRRA hired us seagoing cowboy to take care of horses,young cows,and mules.

so far I have told you about all the good things about being a seagoing cowboy it is also dangerous.

On my second trip I was the night watchman my job was to report to the captian every hour to tell him how the animals were doing one rainy night I was making my hourly report

I slid down a slippery ladder and craked one of my ribs

Some details are when he traveled on a cattle boat he travled with literally 335 horses, hey, and oat. the reason why the catle boat trip is unbeliveable is because not many people get to do so. the reason why the two week boat trip could be fun is that if your watchman you get to heck the horses every hour. this is some support of why you should participate in the seagoing cowboys program.

In Conclusion, you should participate in this program because it would be a unbeliveable program for you to participate in. this program would be fun if you love traveling and animals.

First you get to help many nations with food supplies and animals, like young cows, mules, and horses, to get over seas. Second you can see many places across the ocean. The Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of free time on their hands, so they can visit a lot of places. If the Seagoing Cowboys are in Venice, Italy you could take a gondola ride. Or if they are in Greece the Seagoing Cowboys could see the Acropolis.

The third and final reason why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is you could do lots of fun fun stuff with other people. That stuff could be playing vollyball, baseball, table-tennis, boxing, or fencing. You could also do stuff on your own like reading or whittling

Those are three reasons, helping nations, sight seeing, and having fun with other people doing the same thing (or by yourself), are why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.",2,6,0.87870854139328

boy who just graduated high school and has no idea what is in store for me. I am 17 going on 18 and I just graduated high school now my freind Don wants to take me to Europe. The seagoing cowboys is fun, safe, and helpful.

First of all, Seagoing Cowboys is fun. When they're done taking care of the animals we can play volleyball games in the mean time. Some people who disagree might say that it is a waste of time, just playing games, that's just their opinion. Over on the fun side, we can also play baseball for fun. I can tell each and every one of the Seagoing Cowboys, are having the time of their lives on our ship.

Next, it is safe for the cowboys. The ship is espeicialy safe with the war over there's nothing to worry about on that ship. Some people might say that the ship is not safe for people just because I fell. To add on to the fact that the ship is safe they dont have to worry about getting drafted, because the draft board will make you do the Seagoing Cowboys as your service. I can tell from this information the crew is as safe as can be.

Last but not certainly

least, the program is helpful to other people and animals. It helps the animals get to another location so that the owners can rebuild their farm. Some of the people who are against the cowboy idea might say that because they're playing games that they're not taking care of the animals. From this information you can tell that the cowboy program is more helpful than you thought before.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is fun, safe, and helpful to people and animals. Now that I found out what's in store for me I'm probably going to do this for a very long time. Help me out with this argument go to www.seagoingcowboys.com and vote for this program.             ",4,6,0.7348669767379761

You should join this program because it will be a fun adventure for yourself and your kids. You get to go around the world to help other people. You also get to visit Greece,Europe,and China. You get a tour around all these places. You will never forget this memory of adventuring around the world.

There is a lot of fun parts about this adventure. First off you get to meet new people and learn their language. Another reason why it is fun is because you get to play games in the empty holds after they unload the animals. Most people go because that they want to help out the people that lost most of their stuff in the war. What if you lost all your stuff in a fire,wouldn't you want help from other people. That is how these people feel when they do not get help.

They need help and we can help with that. We can send food over to them and we can build shelters to help them out. Luke wanted to do this for the people and that is what you should do too. When there is war people die and some of those people have family at home waiting for their return and some do not return home at all. If that happened to your family how would you feel?

You will be glad if you go on this trip. You will have so much fun with your kids or by yourself. You get to do things other people can not do because they do not have cars or do not have enough money to get done there to aboard the ship. Have you ever been to Europe,Greece,or China .

The Sea going Cowboys are good for the world because they save people's life.

Luke had made 9 trips over the world and the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Sea going Cowboys ride on cattle-boat so they can go around the world. The Seagoing Cowboys help 44 nations to joind together to make the UNRRA.

When we aren't caring for the animals then we are out site seeing or playing games on the boat. In the empty stals the horese, cattle, and mules aren't in we play games like baceball and volleyball they had table tennis tournaments, fencing tournaments, boxing tournaments, they read, and other games that would help pass the time.

This could be a danger if you aren't careful, one time it was raining and I was on nightwatch then I fell and a strip o melat stoped me from falling overboard. I couldn't work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs from me hitting them of the strip of metal.

This awareness stayed with me, this led my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Some other people think it is dangerous to be a Seagoing Cowboy. I do think that sometimes it can be dangerous. That is why there are multiple people on the ship so they can help you when you get hurt, or can take over your job so you can heal.

When I got there and started doing what i was suppost to do I started enjoying it.

A reason I did is because I knew I was doing the right thing by helping with there community and just helping them with some little things also. Another reason is that when I went their I got to explore the acropolis in Greece and it was beautiful I think you would like it to. I also got a ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. I also went to china! It was very fun and so is being a Seagoing Cowboy. I also learned alot from it like we dont have to worry if we are going to get what we want for breakfast because some people that are less fortunate dont even have Three meals a day. It was hard to take that in but it deffinetly changed my whole point of view in life. I hope that if you give being a Seagoing Cowboy a shot that it would change your point of view in life also.

You should give it a try and see if you like it. If you do not like it you do not have to do it but if you do like it i suggest you do it more often, it is helping out and it is doing the right thing.

Luke found his oppritunity of a lifetime; the UNRRA was Luke's oppritunity and experience of a lifetime.

The UNRRA helped Luke out tremeandosly; UNRRA helped Luke understand the situations people were in; the program helped Luke recognize and make him more aware of people's needs and problems that they are having to live with. This program opened up the world for Luke, and Luke used his experience in is lifetime after he was done being a Seagoing Cowboy; Luke housed many international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Luke has helped many lives; Through this experience Luke has made himself a better person, too.

One of the most memerable parts about this experience was the sights Luke was allowed to see; Luke loved the destinations he was allowed to view, for the price he paid to help other people.

Lucas was allowed to view

Venice, Italy by taking a gondalo ride; China; Europe;and the Panama Canal on his way to China.

If you are in the wrong demeanor or you are melancholy all of the time, join the UNRRA program. This program will help you out tremendously; it helped Luke out a great amount.

Even if you aren't the most gregarious person... this program could help you become more of a people person.

The program will give you an I-feel-like-I-know-everyone feeling.

This experience could help you be a better,more exuberant person.

UNRRA is an amazing way to meet new friends; those new friends could end up being your best friend for the rest of your life.

Don Reist was probably Luke's best friend for the rest of Luke's life; Don was the one who engadged Luke's intrest into the UNRRA program.

If it wasn't for Don ever inviting Luke on the trip, Luke might not of ever transfromed into a greater, helpful person.

Luke wouldv'e never transferred the knowledge he learned over to his family; Luke wouldn't of been elligable to house students or visitors; those people would never have gotten the chance to have their own experience of a lifetime.

Luke was very lucky to be able to help people in different countries that were left in ruins after the war ended.

In Luke's life, Don was very important.

He helped him become the person that Luke was supposed to become. Luke is very grateful for Don.

Without Luke and everyone else it would have been a lot harder to transport the animals to different places in the world.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy because you get to experience the feeling of helping others who are in need.

Another reason why people should become a Seagoing Cowboy is because you can take tours and

go see different places.

For example if you went to France you could go to Paris and see the Eifel Tower!

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be very fun!

People need Seagoing Cowboys because they might not have enough money to stay on the boats with their animals.

Also, people won't want their animals to be alone during a long boat ride.

Seagoing Cowboys can also help with giving animals comany.

Seagoing Cowboys are also needed to take care of the animals.

For example, if the captain of the ship is too busy to feed the animals then no one will feed them!

Then the animals could die!

Right there on the ship!

If the animals die, the people have no where to put them.

What is next?

Throwing them overboard?

We need Seagoing Cowboys for many reasons.

These are just a couple of reasons.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is not easy.

Some of the trips that Luke took lasted two whole weeks!

That is pretty long.

It is also expensive.

On one of the trips that Luke took they had about 335 horses plus enough food for them to eat!

That is a lot of food. On that same trip, Luke arrived the day the Pacific war ended.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is also difficujlt because they probably had to cross through many storms.

Also,

they were on the ship during the Pacific war.

Serving as a Seagoing Cowboy takes courage, responsibility, hard work, and possitive attitudes.

That is exactly what Luke had.

We are thankful for what Luke did.

Luke is an inspiration to us all.

We look up to him as a friend and as a follower in his foot steps to become the best person we can be.
