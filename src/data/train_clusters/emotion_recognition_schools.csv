Most people can tell when someone is sad, happy, or mad just by looking at them, but what happens when that person is hiding how they are truely feeling. What then? Well new techonlogy can allow us to see exctly how someone, who is trying to hide there emotions, is feeling. This is unfair for many reasons. The technology may be cool but people have a right to keep how they are feeling a secert.

The computer software works by making a 3-D computer model of the face; the computer watches the different muscles in the face move to identify how the person is feeling. The technolgy delevopted by Dr. Huang can even calculate mixed emotions with the exact percent of how strong the emotions are. Dr. Huang obseres that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" I htought people expressed emotions in different ways though? Dr Hoang also states that ""even though individuals often show verying degrees of expression.""

People have a right to not tell people how they are feeling. Did we really need to know the Mona Lisa was 9 percent disgusted? Now that raises the question of why? Was Leonardo de Vinci's hair messed up? Or did she think he needed to take a shower? What is the point in knowing someone is feelings without knowing why? We do not need technology to ask someone how they are feeling. or even why the are feeling the way they are feeling that way.

There are really no benfits to knowing how someone is feeling without knowing why. The technology is very cool. It is crazy how Dr Huang was able to develope a computer that uses muscle movment to idenitfy emotions. The technology is useless though unless you are prepare and willing to ask why?

0084f6c,"What exactly is the facial action coding system? Well it enables computers to identify human emotions and expressions. This is an interesting way to understand a indivuals emotional expressions. Children in this mordern day have a tendency of hiding some deep emotions and expressional feelings from their peers,friends,and family. Being able to figure out some of their emotions could save a lot of problems long term.

The worst thing a person can do is hide their emotions from people. This can really lead to a bad depression or other sad emotional syndromes. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it stated that ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, etc."" This shows that a person understanding someone emotions is very diffucult. People can hide their feelings really well especially students when even they are having their worst day.

Facial action coding system can really help adults to understand the true emotions of a student. The story says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insturctor."" This by far is an excellent idea. In the US in today's world a lot of students homework is online. Not even just homework at school but in everyday life it has something to do with technology.

By being said the students that can't comprehend the lesson, there can be an alternative assignment that they can to so at least they are learning something. Doing something that you kind of know and bettering yourself at that is way more benefical then doing something you have no knowledge of. A lot of students don't ask for help when they are struggling with a assignment. Most of the time they either skip it or copy down answer without getting the full structure of the material. If the students are not understanding something in a lesson the material is only going to get way harder for them without any help.

In the end, the facial coding system is a great creation and will be very benefical toward students. Teachers a very educated and have the Knowledge to help the students. If they don't know who is struggling though at all times they can't help every student.                                                   ",4,7,0.9172530770301819
00a4469,"Using technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could help students learn in ways that suit them, prevent students from getting angry or stressed, and make them feel valued.

The article says that the computer would be able to tailor lessons to suit each students needs based on what emotions they're showing. This could greatly improve a student's education. A lot of students don't seek help if they get behind or don't understand something, the Facial Action Coding System could help them out by recognizing their confusion and changing the lesson to best suit them.

Speaking of emotions, the Facial Action Coding System would be able to prevent students from getting too angry or too stressed. If a student is showing strong negative emotions, the FACS could notify someone or tell the student to take a break.

Many students hide their negative emotions in a classroom, for fear of looking bad amongst their peers. The FACS could help students, by acknowleding their emotions and change the lesson or the atmosphere. Overall this could boost both grades and school attendence, by making students feel valued, like someone cares about their feelings.

Using the Facial Action Coding System in schools could be a valuable asset to education. It could help students improve, keep them from getting too upset, and make them feel valued.   ",4,7,0.8741369843482971

These Facial Action Coding Systems will be even more of a distraction. Phones are already enough of a distraction this will be even worse. Kids will just make face expressions to find out what emotion a certain face tells. ""Empathy (feeling somone else's emotional state..."" Most kids like to just have their space and not be bothered. This is also spending money on things that are not mandantory so money will just be wasted. At the end of the day like who is really interested in what a face expression tells about you?

This computer can be a problem too some kids. Other kids knowing about their emotions they can be bullied and mistreated for how they feel. Every ""positive"" always has a negative. This can bring hatred upon someone a kid who is always sad and has hatred can be bullied and make the kid even more depressed. ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" This Facial Coding system can ruin some kids this is not for everyone, your emotions are not for everyone.

Why is determining what your facial expression says about you instead of learning? Why are we not focused on teaching out kids great education and personal finance? We are so caught up in technology our kids are getting distracted and in trouble over it. The Facial Action Coding System doesn't belong in schools and shouldn't be allowed too.

Anybody can read a room. Whether it's at a party, an important meeting, a funeral, or a Pre-Calculus lesson at 8 a.m., it's easy to look around and see how the people around you are feeling due to body language and facial expression.

Others don't think so, though. Prof. Thomas Huang and his team of experts have come up with new tech that can recognize all 44 muscles in the human face, and create a diagnostic on how a person is feeling. This is interesting, yes, but some may think that this technology could be used in classrooms to get a general feel on what each student is feeling about a lesson.

I believe that using the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in a classroom setting would have no merit and would just be a waste of time and money in public schools across America, because of how weak the technology in the FACS actually is.

In the text, Dr. Huang says that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" and that ""varying degrees of expression"" can still be used to recognize the feelings and emotions of any human being. When applying this to a classroom enviroment, this can't be correct. That is due to many natural factors in humans.

For example, the world has progressed a lot, and more children with mental disabilities and special needs are being allowed to be involved in regular classes. For a student with a form of autism, it may be hard for them to convey certain emotions on a regular basis. The technology wouldn't be able to read their face correctly. Another example is for a student with a physical disability whose face couldn't be read properly by the FACS. There are too many outliers for the technology to be accurate, unless you had a room of children who all express their emotions like an open book.

The text also says that ""most human communications are nonverbal."" I agree with this statement, actually. It proves that one can never tell what a person is thinking just by what they say, or their facial expressions. The only true place you can know how somebody really feels is in their mind. I, for one, never really say or express how I feel about school infront of any sort of teacher or staff. It's a general rule among students at my school to onlt talk about teachers or lessons outside of the classroom. Now, this may not be how it is in other public school settings. If it happened to, though, then the FACS technology would be obsolete in its purpose.

Lastly, in paragraph 9, the text says that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, ""putting on a face"", or a poker face, actually trains your body to be in a better mood. This means that literally anyone could trick the FACS into thinking that they were in a happy mood when need be. Students could easily ""beat the system"" by manipulating the FACS into giving off a false diagnostic every time, and therefore ruining the FACS's credability. Until the FACS can tell when a group of teenagers are faking their emotions, it can't perform its main task.

In conclusion, Dr.Huang's FACS technology cannot work due to how baseless it's ethics are, how difficult it really is to understand emtions just by facial expression, and how easy it is to manipulate it's process.",4,7,0.8079482316970825
00fd564,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is valuable because it can help students learn the material the instructor is teaching that day much faster allowing the students to have a fun yet educational experience in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System will make the classroom more entertaining to all grade levels even in college, and the system will identify the emotions the user is feeling and will adjust the lesson plan to the students' liking.

The emotions are one of the only ways we can tell what each other are feeling but also thinking at the moment.

These days the only way that communicate mainly is through texting and most people don't like to call each other because people are becoming too caught up in technology to actually talk to the person they are trying to communicate with.

Also the people are becoming too lazy to actually call the person or actually go to the person in person and have their conversation with them.

In the education department of the government they are coming up with all these standardized test to prove that the student is eligiable to go to the next level of education, but in most of the schools in the United States who use these standardized tests most of the students fail the test and have to retake the test again the next year or semester.

With Professor Huang's creation of this tecnology the education system will be getting better and better tests results if this system is implemented into the schools all around the United States.

The Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into the school systems all around the world because every child deserves a good education even if they are poor or don't have money to pay for the schooling.

The reason the Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into the school systems all around the world because the software will help students all grade levels succeed in the real world and have a good education and will help the student find good jobs once they graduate high school or college.

One way that the new new facial action coding system would be good to read emotions of students because it could help figure out people's emotions. One deatil to support my claim is that in the story it says "" for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face , of course most of us would have troube actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy or sad. That means that with the facial scan computer they acn do it with no hassle at all.

Another reason that the new facial action coding system could help is because it can tell if people have mixed emotoins. One reason to support is that in the text it says ""Dr Huang oberves thata artist such as da vinci studied how human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. That means that if someone is having mixed emotions the computer can detect the emotions that person is having.

My third reason that the facial acting coding system would be good is because it can hepl put a smile on people faces. One detain that supports my clain is "" According to the facial feedback theory of emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but can also help you produce them (Putting on a happy face).

018985d,"Identifying Human Emotions

Imagine being able to figure out exactly how anyone in this world are feeling with just a computer. Now software has developed that could help you do just that. The Fcial Action Coding System has applications that will be extraordinary to modern day technology.

Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman created the the FACS. All which have six emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are emotions that are used on a daily basis around the world so they are pretty basic. Video imagery is used that tracks one's facial movements. Therefore it can identify mixed emotions. The video imagery compares each expression with a neutral face in order to figure your emotions.

Imagine being at school on your classroom computer learning something boring, and all of a sudden the topic becomes fun. Dr. Huang predicts that your classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored. It would be useful to many students in order to make and help them learn better. This same technology could make identifying emotions much easier. The boring lesson for you would modify. This way the computer will know to keep giving you boring lessons or fun ones.

Facial muscles are obviously an important item in this. If the technology could not identify the way your facial muscles move, then the technology would not work. Not only do your muscles express emotion, but they also help produce them. The article states that a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. This clearly would help the actors express themselves better, thanks to our face muscles. People may not notice, but we imitate other people's facial expressions with empathy.

Who would have thought that sience and technology could be involved with a big feature of who we are. Sometimes being able to figure how someone is feeling. At times we may even have to bug them in order to figure the emotion. Now with the new technology of FACS, this task will be easier.

One of the reason i think this way is becuase teachers should not have to use a machine is read their students emotions by simple just asking a student on how he or she feels can get the same results. Another reason is the money for a machine like this is very costy, and not every school could afford a machine like this. Also the machine is and invination of privites and some students might not want their emotions read

Most students are under stress by school work and the could easly be read by anyone and it would be a waste of the schools money to read the emotion of a student. Also the student could be sad, angery, or happy about something totally differant from school work, and that means it could throw the machine off.

I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling. I find it very cool that they can use a 3D scale model of the face and maintiain the muscles in the face that move just like our muscles in or face move today.

Once students understand how there technology works they will began expressing themselves through culture, Litilarcery, and so much more. In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it says "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This allows some computer software to recognize emotions.

Facial expressions are a very important detail in every individuals life. Reading someones facial expression can tell you what you need to do next. For example in paragragh 4 it says "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, "" even though individuals oftem show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly)."" So when your friends mad and doesnt want you near her or shes just confused, now you'll know your next step.

Emotions are not just expressions on ones face but body movement as well. Body Language plays an important roll in facial expressions. In paragragh 3 it tells us ""Eckman has classified six basic-emotion shappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movents of the facial muscles."" For example when your angery your orbicularis oris which is the place around your mouth, it tightens your lips up to show your emotion.

Most humans can already tell how our friends, family and other people are feeling just because we can look at them and tell how their feeling its as if we already knew hoow they felt just by the look on their face.

Everybody has an expression that shows how the feel each day a couple of genious's made an invention that changed the world it can tell you how a person is feeling in many different ways but they do it so everybody knows what they are feeling even though they might or might not know.

Everybody feels different emotions some might even be depressed because of maybe a loss of a family member or a best friend so might be angry because of many different things everybody have different emotions me i had depression for a long time and it took me a little bit to realize theres more to life than just sorrow or depression just move on and just try and find someone who makes me happy theres this girl that makes me happy we aren't dating but she gives me hope for the future as i said everybody is different.

Using this new technology serves great purpose and value to us as consumers because it is created to help us understand our history and advance in other forms of technology.

To begin, the facial recognition technology serves great purpose and value because it unlocks new discoveries in our history. With this being said, new beginnings are coming about because we know more about how Mona Lisa was feeling while Da Vinci was painting this famous portrait that is spoken about all across America. It gives insight on the deeper meaning of this painting. For example, we now know that Da Vinci must have studied the human body in order to create such a wonderful piece of artwork. In the text it states,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" Due to his great knowledge of the human body and muscles he was able to paint precise emotions and because he painted such precise emotions, people today were able to unlock how she felt during this time. A new discovery. After all, this advanced tech can now bring this history piece to life. In the text it states,""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This creates a new perspective of how we view our history and it also could unlock mysteries in our histories past.

In addition,this technology advancement was created only to help people. As consumers, we always think about, what would this do for me? With that being said, the Facial Action Coding System could have a positive affect on our medicines, entertainment, and medical technology. In the text it states,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressivefor video games or video surgery."" The one thing I think about when I hear America is sports, which is a form of entertainment. The new technology could benefit our use of televisions and radios or smartphoneswhich we watch sports on. Another thing I think about it when someone is speaking about this country is medical purposes. Our country has amazing medical advances and technology. The facial coding could help create a better understanding or a better alternative for complicated technology. Then again, as consumers we also spend alot of time on social media or looking at ads. Sometimes there are things we are not interested in at all but they annoyingly still pop up. With the facial coding, our faces can be detected if we like the ad and if we do not like the ad. This benefits us greatly because it shows what we do want to see and what we do not want to see. In the text it states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown,the next ad will be different."" Many might say this does not matter but ads are everywhere and our world is only going to rely on computers, or other forms of technology so why not embrace it and try to advance too?

The Facial Action Coding System is a computer software creater of Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the Unviersity of Illinois. That can calculate emotions based of all fortity four major muscles from the human face and classified them as six emotions Happiness, surprise , disgust, fear , and saddness.

For many students it'll be a great experience to open up to the science world to learn further more about the human emotions based of your facial muscle. ""The facial experssions for each emotion are universal"" from Dr. Huang.

It's been founded that the great picture of Mona Lisa painting of Lenardo da Vinci. That Mona Lisa in the art was eighty three percent happy, nine percent digusted , six fearful and 2 percent angry. It's interesting for people to know such little detail from a great iconic peice from old history, where the Mona Lisa was really intended to bring smile to us.

031ab01,"If we had a facial action coding system in every classroom, Would the students have a higher chance of suceeding? Would they get more or less help? Would this gather more attention in class? I would think so. I mostly agree with having a facial Action Coding system in classrooms to tell how the students are feeling. I disagree with some aswell. If the teachers could tell exactly how each student is feeling in class, like bored or confused, I think that they would provide more help to those students, and there will be a higher percentage of people who pass there clases. In the passage making Mona Lisa Smile, they used the technology on the painting of Mona Lisa. I think that if they used it on the students, they would be more engaged and ready to learn.

I think that the students would find more things being taught to them in class interesting. In the passage it has an example that I think would be good for the use of this software to be in schools. ""For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If this were to happen, I know that I would do a lot better. I feel that many other students would do better too. When we get an ad that we like, and similar ads pop up, usually they are watched. If we were in class and we felt happy, or not happy with what we are learning, The teaching style or lesson might change to something that will keep more students engaged. But I feel like their are other things that aren't so good about the software.

If the softwared was installed in every class and you walked in feeling very upset for something that maybe happened outside of class or school, you will most likely feel that way the whole time during that class. The machine might pick that up as if you are not being interested in the topic. You wouldn't get anywhere. Now if you tell the teacher that you aren't happy for whatever reason, thats a different story. But, if you're shy and you don't tell people how you feel especially if something happened to make you feel sad, angry, etc... I don't think the machine would help to much in terms of education. But if you are more engaged in learning because of the software, I think their will be a way higher chance for more people to graduate.

If you are engaged, interested, or into whatever you're learning, You will most likely be paying attention and taking in the information. If you were in class, and the software picks up that you understand whats being taught, more people would focus in that class. If this happens, more people would pass tests, exams, and graduate. After you graduate, you will have learned all the education that you needed to learn to go to college. Sence more people have the education, more people would go to college.

If we had the facial action coding system software in classrooms I think that more people would have a higher chance of succeeding, getting help, paying attention, passing tests and exams. I also think that more people will go to college. I think that more people would pay attention, be interested in what they're learning, and I think it would be easier to more students. If the software were to mess up, I think that the teachers would have more problems to deal with like getting it fixed, or just simply teach without it. If their are no problems with it, I think that this would be a very helpful tool for teachers and students.",4,7,0.835566520690918
03314fd,"After reading this article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I believe that being able to detect and know how to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and could be useful for many. Using technology to know whether an individual is upset, happy, mad, etc. could be used as an improvement on our daily lives. According to the article, they tested this new technology on the famous Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting and defined that ""she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The outcomes from this new technology system could actually be legit and can tell us what people feel. This new sofware can also help the people that are to afriad to express their feelings or don't know how to .

Sense there are some individuals who hid their feelings and aren't that easy to read their emotions by just looking at their facial expressions, by using this system you could read and even track their face movments and even their mixed emotions also. For instance, as stated in the passage ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"".""Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This new software can help those who have a ""neutral face"" and show no emotion.

Facial expressions aren't always going to reveal how an individual is actually feeling or what emotions he is going through inside. For example, in the article it indicates that the Mona Lisa is ""9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"", even though in the painting she looks 100 percent happy. This software will read off your emotions no matter what face expression you are making. Many of us can use this software to figure out what others are feeling when they are to scared to tell others how they feel. For instance, if someone is feeling really upset and has a neutral face and you can't tell that they are upset, you can't help them unless you know how they are feeling.

In conculsion, I believe that This new software ""Facial Action Coding"" that helps reveal human emotions by using technology cn be valuable and useful for certain people.",3,7,0.8781185746192932

Some people will think that someone is happy when they're really just putting a fake smle on their face.""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" With this new technology you can see how their really feeling.

How you use this technology can show if it's valuable or not. Using it to see if a student is having trouble is valuable, but if you use it just for the fun of it, it's not valuable. ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" The Facial Action Coding System can also be used for criminals. When officers are not sure wether some man is a criminal, he can use this technology to see if the criminal is lying.

I believe that the new advancment would be a wonderful idea. I believe that seeing somebody's when they are trying to hide them is gonna bring new thrills to life. Actually knowing someone's emotions could be beneficial for thing such as suicide maybe if we knew what somebody's emotions were we would be able to help somebody to make them feel happy. In the passage article for has a quote saying ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" I believe this is a good quote because it ties in with me saying that emotions could help people but having facial emotions would benefit as well because then we would not only physically see someone's emotion but we would be able to feel the happiness, pain,anger or etc.

So overall I think Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman could possibly have a amazing overall invention there are lots of positives for this invention. Such as having less suicides, or maybe if seeing someone happy could make someone else happy and could start a emotion train.

The real question is, do you want your teacher to know if your happy, sad, mad, fustrated, confused, or board?

To some, the answer is simply yes, the ones who want others to know what ther are feeling are mostlikly a socil-type person.

On the other hand, its a simple no, if you know somone is gauging your emotions, say you didn't want anyone to know your mad, angery, or sad, would you be afraed to make any exprestion at all, or even go to class.

Nowadays, being watched is a normal acurance, but not to the personal level as to your emotions or thoughts.

Many may ask, what good is it to know about how one is feeling, the answer is unclear.

In paragraph six, the artical tells how helpfull FACS could be to the classroom, but if students should learn anything about real life, its crucial for them to understand, you can't please everyone, as much as you try, you won't.

If you have walked into a elementery school in just the past year, you will notice some very different souroundings.

Some elementery schools have laptops for every student, which makes it easyer than ever for a teacher to make and publish an assinment.

As I personly wittnesed my siblings having homework over the weekend, and Fridays, both of which, I never had in elementer school.

To sum it all up, the more tecnolagy we have dosn't always mean it needs to be implamented in a classroom, just becase we can dosen't mean we should.

The Facial Action Coding System could recognize if a student is getting confused and alter the course. So many students using computers for school aren't getting the full potential out of their computers. They stay confused and move on hoping they don't fall behind evryone else. Dr. Huang says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communicaton. So computars need to understand that, too.""

Once again I say that the Facial Action Coding System would be a good thing to use in the classroom. Not only would it help students, but the same technology could be used for video games to make faces more expressive. Or to use with video surgey.

This is what the Facial Action Coding System prevents student from experiencingwhen taught a new topic. This helps student by having the system already knowing they don't understand to topic they had just learned. Although Facial Action Coding System watches your face is wierd, it'll help out teachers and students because it'll help our classroom be more understanding, helpful, and communicate better.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be more understanding.

In the article, it states, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelling simply by the look on her face (paragraph 5)."" It also states,""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears in you screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnet (paragraph 6)."" These quotes show that classrooms can be more understanding with this system. Because if you frown, the teacher will be notified and will ask if you understand yet or need help. And this system will help teachers to more ""calculated"" of what their class needs more work on. And understand the topic they have learned.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms be helpful. In the article it states,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor (paragraph 6) ."" This means that this system can be helpful by providing information to the teacher. And so the teacher can have an effective teaching plan to help out the class in learning the topic better. So they don't get lost and confused on the topic.

The Facial Action Coding System can help classrooms communicate better. In the article it said,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. ""Most humans communication in nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to undersatnd that, too(paragraph 6)."" This all means that this sysytem will help us communicate better. And because most of human communication happens nonverbally. It won't be too diffcult to do. This system will help the students and the teacher to communicate with each other effectivly without saying a word.

In concluion, better communication, more helpful, and more understanding are some of the pros of having the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom. Although having the Facial Action Coding System watch your face is pretty weird. Other than that, it's pretty cool that it can help the student(s) and the teacher. The students get a chance to work together to help the teacher understand them better. This system helps them communicate better overall.

This system can reconize your emotions. Many peolpe tend to hide their emotions .In the Mona Lisa she is eighty-three percent happy,nine percent disgusted,six percent fearful,and two percent angry. This computer system software helped the Mona Lisa's emotions,which can help us too. This process begins when the compyter constructs a 3D computer model of the face all fourty four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Emotion,moving your facialmuscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may even help produce them.

Another reason is this may help you with communication ,this software can help you communicate. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie these muscle cluses are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isnt't being truthful. This helps weather someone fake smiles to you or not. In a real smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. This computer system knows if you are faking it.

This software may also help teachers out. This computer system can tell if students are bored in class,or if they are confused .This system can tell teachers that students need more review on the lesson .This may be a great a idea niot only it helps teachers but,human communcation is nonverbal,including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too.

That is a good idea because this could impact investigation, like cops figuring out who the're dealing with. For example, say there was a bank robbery and the criminals got away, but soon the cops found them and arrested them, they could either sit down with them and try and work their way around to see if the're is something wrong with them or they could just snap a picture and figure out thier expressions by using the FACS, (Facial Action Coding System). that would make it easier on investigators because the artical says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly"". using video imagery, the new software tracks the facial movements in a real face.

04a4399,"The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools to help students. There are benefits to this system, but the bad outweigh the good. This technology used to reconize emotions will affect students in ways that aren't necessary, and cause unwanted problems in the classroom.

Firstly, the article metions this system being used on computers while students are working to analyze their emotions. The author writes "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" (Alto 6). Having a computer watch students' facial expressions while working could make the students feel uncomfortable and give them anxiety. Being uncomfortable while working will effect the way a student learns. They will not be focusuing on the material they are learning, but instead the idea that they are being watched. This is a problem that's not needed in the classroom and can be avoided.

Secondly there are tons and tons of emotions a human can express. The author writes "" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (Alto 3). Having only classified six emotions, is not a very wide range. What if for example, a student were to show an emotion that the computer doesn't have programmed and reconizes it as somthing else, changing the lesson to fit the wrong emotion? This would cause the lesson to be changed when the student didn't need it to be. This creates a technology problem along with the problem of fixing the lesson and wasting time the student could be using to learn.

Lastly, having a computer analize a students emotions while working would leave the teacher with nothing to teach or help the students with. This might seem like a good thing at first, but teachers create the classroom atmosphere and keep students ingaged in learning. Why have a computer analyze student emotions when teachers have been doing it perfectly for years?

The Facial Action Coding System is a great advance in technology, but when it comes to schools, the System should not be used. It only creates problems that are not needed. These problems could be avoided by not using the system.",4,7,0.8913465142250061

You have six basic emotions that this program can detect just by your mucsles in your face. When they scanned Mona Lisa's face she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry.

Now if people start turnning towards this method of telling how people feel instead of asking them to make them feel better then you are shutting yourself off from society and that's not okay. If you want to now how someone feels don't make a 3-D model of their face to have a computer tell you just go up and ask them how they feel and what will make them feel better. It amazes you when you find out how many people turn towards technology instead of face to face converstations.

Fianally if you scan someones face to see if you can make them feel better than you are doing it all wrong. You need to walk up to that person and say ""Are you okay, what do you need to help you"". Also when you do scan someones face they can put on whats called a ""Fake Smile"" and trick the computer into thinking it's a actual smile, so it will say they are happy when in reality you are mad or upset.

There have been many scientists and researchers that are working on this so it can detect your emotions by the muscles in your body. It is kind of like when you are trying to detect a friends emotion because you can tell how they are feeling.

Imagine this a system that can read your emotions based on your facial expressions that is based off of facial muscles. This is something we already kind of do when we try to tell a friends facial expressions. This is something that we humans should be happy to have we hate being bored and a computer would be able to tell that we are, so it would never play that video or ad again which would make it would modify the lesson for each person according to Huang. Also if you really liked that video or ad that was just played they would play simliar ones to it.

Dr. Huang also explains that most communication is non verbal in fact most of our communication is non verbal.

So, what is the Facial Action Coding System you might be thinking. Well the facial action coding system is a computer that constructs a 3d model of each persons face. This must take a while since we do have 44 major muscles in our face. This computer is basically supposed to be able to detect at least the 6 main basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The machine can do so by it can tell the characteristic movements of each facial muscle. The article describes like when you raise your eyebrows you show surpise and when the muscles around your lips it shows anger. This can be benificial in a lot of ways especially when it can tell that you don't like something. Also humans might try to guess facial traits, but we can't describe each facial trait someone has.

Surely you are thinking that a machine can't detect somebodies emotions, but it could detect that the Mona Lisa she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful, and

2% angry. The machine might have some faults at first, but surely if they can make something like that they could improve it. This could be what humans need something or somebody that actually knows how we feel. If that's not convincing if we have psychologists that can detect our emotions based on our smile why can't they help the people coding these machines and get everything right.

In conclusion, is there a machine that can detect our feeling. There could be something or someone that can help in the near future, but currently this is just a project. This is something that could be in the future that will replace our current computers and/ or our smartphones. This is a start to something that could reveal al lot about us, our faces, and our emotions. ",3,7,0.8244377374649048

To me that is personal information that I would want to myself. Plus I doubt that there would be a whoe lot a people who would put money into this to just see what emotion they are. That is just me though. What do you think about this idea? Would you spend time and money on it to just see your emotions and what mood you were in? I wouldn't.

If you keep reading from now on I am going to argue why this is a bad idea, because it is. I mean who would spend any type of time, effort, or money on this just to see what your emotions are or how you are feeling. Honestly who wants to know what facial expressions to use to show that you are happy, I think we already know how to be happy. We dont need a machine to tell us how to look happy. Obviously when someone is happy something great has happened to them or in their lives and they have a great big smile on their face. We also know when someone is mad, obviously when someone is mad they don't like to talk very much, and usually look like they are about to punch you in the face. For example in the text it shows you step by step what expression on your face we need to use to make us look happy, like no I know how to look happy or sad or mad, I don't need a machine to tell me how to do that.

So why do we need a machine to tell us these things when we already know them. Our world is just spending money on useless things and inventing usless things that our world today doesn't need. There is literally no point to the invention. Plus I don't think strangers would want us to calculate their emotions and how they are feeling right now. I mean those things are personal we don't know what their life is like or what they have been through.

To me this is what I am thinking. Is this really what they are spending our money on. The taxes we pay and all the bills we have to pay and they are speding it on these types of silly, usless inventions. Why? Just think, out of the whole world how many of us are going to use this? How many of us have the money to use it? How many of us would think its a great idea? Probably very, very, very few of us in the whole world would use this invention.

That is my take on this Facial Action Coding System. I dont like the idea of it. I think it it useless and would very seldom be used. What do you think? Do you agree with me, or not with me?

You should know how you feel, not letting a computer or any other technology ran device to find out your emotions. If you don't know your emotions that's because you have mixed thoughts. Your facial expression that you show to people as you walk around should tell them how you feel, for instance; looking upset shows many emotions, smiling could mean you're happy or just faking it because you're actually really depressed and don't want anyone to know.

Also, most of these type tehnologies are useful mainly at expensive images such as Mona Lisa portrait. This type of system only helps solve the mysteries behind old images such as Mona Lisa and not students' emotions. The author reveals that. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" (D'Alto 6) This shows that the Facial Action Coding System is mainly useful for such mystery portraits. It only helps solve people's curiosity rather than help students in classrooms.

Lastly the new technology also help make computer expressions more real in video games. Dr. Huang explains that, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive__ for video games or video surgery."" (D'Alto 6) This evidence shows that the new software is more valuable at helping video gemes to look more real than helping students to study harder or to succeed.

Lastly, the new technology, ""Facial Action Coding System"" is not relevant for students in classroms because it is unaffordable, mainly useful for expensive portraits, and video games. There are many disadvantages than advantages for using the new technology at schools. The new system is more useful at video games and expensive portraits such as Mona Lisa's than in schools.",4,7,0.8714812994003296
05fa43a,"Using this technology that could read emotional expressions of students is very valuable. Imagine someone acting to be really happy with a big smile in their face, and then actually being upset about something. The article had a lot of possitive points about this technology.

A lot of people would say no to this technology because they are getting checked by a computer. Some are also very excited to see if the computer would actually say how they are feeling and their imotions they are feeling. It can calculate how you feel just by constructing your face and seeing how all 44 mucles of your face are.

Dr. Huang says ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expresion."" He is trying to say that even when people try to change the way their face acts. The computer may still know how your actual emotions are. These new technology is so amazing because it can even be on your own PC.

Scientst have used these technology to in many things. They have used it specially in the famous art work of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. They have found out how she was actually feeling when she was being drawn. These new technology can actually calculate every emotion. Even if it is in the past.

All these amazing things about this technology should be valuable in classroom. The students would be able to study new things about how this actually works. How it can make everyone feel better about it. The students actually doing this things with these technology would actually make them a bit happier. This is why this technology that reads expressions should be valuable in a classroom. ",3,7,0.894037663936615

We all know someone that says they are fine but they think something else, but we cant fingure out how they also feel. But with this new program it will be way easier and that is a good thing. ""the software can even identifiy mixed emotions.... each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)."" Since this software can tell peoples emotions it could help in therapy with things, like if a person comes in for therapy but says they feel good about it but they dont act like it the therapist could do this test and see what they are having trouble with or how they really feel about the subject at hand.

Some kids can get bored in school and just zone out because the material they are being taught does not click with them but that can be changed with this new program. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Dr. huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" this could benifit both the school system and the child. the child will be more attentive with the lesson if he or she understands it or they think it is interesting and then they might even score higher in school, and have a better futre.

Some people might just look mean when you walk by them, or it may even be you that always gets asked ""You always look mad so i dont talk to you."" nut now since this program came out, the theory that comes with it is that it can help you produce new emotions. "" According to the Facial feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them."" this can benifit poeple in many ways. They might become happier and more out going. They could have better oppertunities when it comes to work because they have a good attutide.

These ads are to prompt customers into buying the latest devices such as the latest computer, mac pad, the IPHONE X, the smart phone that is as thin as a piece of paper, and the widest, flattest television screen. There is something that all of these devices do not have. Now a new system called the Facial Action Coding System is reaching the surface. This system allows computers to dictate how a person is feeling by just their facial expressions such as muscle placemnts in their face, the rise and fall of cheeks and under eyelids. So is this new system valuable, and can it be beneficial to our community?

This system is beneficial to our school communities. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto its says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Hauang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" If computers were able to see how many kids were and were not ingaged in the activity that takes place on computers, then it would help the schools and the state to know what new things to try to keep kids ingaged so they can get the best possible education offered to them. This system is great for Istep test taking as well. Sometimes kids may fall asleep during testing or they may start too dose off and not be as consentrated as they should, and that could have a negative affect on their test. If the computer could read their emotions it would help us to know what the problem is and the reason why kids are losing focus and once we have confronted the problem we can then began the process of finding an affective solution.

This computer would be very beneficial in offices and in police stations. They could be used to help with criminal justice. A suspect can be told to tell their side of the story infront of a computer screen and the computer would be able to dictate that persons true emotions. This could make the officer, and investigaters job alot easier. They could be used in hospitals to keep an eye on how a paitent is feeling maybe after a recovery or when they are lying on their death bed. In the article it says "" They even can indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" So there is no faking of emotions out of a crime. Its also says "" In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" There is no faking with that computer.

This new system has the ability to make our jobs alot easier. Nowadays people dont usually communicate face to face anymore. That means people dont usually express theirselves in person as much as they once did in earlier days when technology wasnt around. So this can be a way to still be able to know how someone is feeling, esspecially if they are less likely to tell how they are feeling when your right infront of them. This can be very effective with younger kids who may not know how to epress how they may be feeling in the right way, shape, or form. This new system gives us a new way to still connect with our community. This new system is a pathway to a brighter future. This new system is valuable to our community.",4,7,0.8120696544647217
0630503,"I would not think having the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is valuable. The fact that not alot of people want others to know how they feel . Especally teens these days. Teenagers hide alot of emotions for multiple reason. Simply because it can lead to alot of questioning about their life. Not everyone would want people to know what goes on in their life that makes them depressed or sad.

Eckman classified 6 basic emotions - happiness, suprise , anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Why would anyone want anyone else to know if they'er sad or disgusted? What if you was talking to some one and they had an awful smell . Then , the Facial Action Coding System just show how disgusted you are. That would not only hurt the other person's feelings but make you feel mean.

Dr. Huang noted ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" ""So computer need to understand that , too"" . Most human are nonverbal because they chose not to be. Not every one just want to sit not and talk about their feelings. Also, Dr. Huang noted , ""So computers need to understand that , too. Understand what? How might a computer understand? Computers are not humans , they should not have the need to understand anything from a human. That how people these days get so attached to technology.

Human changes are when a person can feel a little happy ,but more sadder. In this essay today I will explain how I think whether the use of the technology should be used in the classroms , based off what iv'e just read .

Based off what i just read in the text ""Making Mona Lisa Smile "" the author Nick, was explaining about how the emotion changes to Mona Lisa expressed how she felt based off cacualations using technology. In the beginning of the txet the author talked about the caculations emotions .For an example in the text text the author quoted "" She's 83 perenct happy, 9 perecnt disgusted ,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No, that's not your science

teacher , grading your lastest lab assignment . "" After , reading that example, you should have a question asking "" How did they know that "" ? .The answer to that question is rare , they knew how much percentages of each emotion was worth

because they caculated it using technology and her body strcutered muscles called Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus. That helps shows the crow-feet aroud the eyes to vertify the emotions ; bsaed off body languages.

I feel that classroms need this computred based technology because it'll tell the teacher wether if a student is feeling good, bad, or okay . I know this because according to the text the author Nick was explaing the caculations of Mona Lisa . It explained her emotions and even the percentages of the emotions. I can connect this to when I was in 3rd grade. I was getting ready for the ISAT test. That day i was not feeling good, I was feeling 80 perecnt worries , 5 perent happy, and 25 percent sad. I did not move to the next grade all because of i was worried about how will I do on the test instead of getting it out the way . My teacher couldn't tell my emotions because my emotions was hidden in silence . That's why I feel this technonlogy should be used in classrooms, but if it is being used in the classroms I hoep it change the looks at things .

After, reading my essay I hope you get a good understanding why iv'e thought it was best to have the technology in classrooms . The caculations will explain how each student is feeling each day of class. The computer will show the progress of an happy , sad , worried, or okay student . A student actions and emotions explains their feelings ,but not the percentages. However, I hope teachers and instructors chose to have the computer based technology to explain a students emotions.         ",3,7,0.7717735767364502
0683ac3,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling by just looking at their face? Now, scientist have discovered a new technology to read emotions. The new technology uses recognition of muscle movements in the face. This new technology would be valubale in a classroom with students because you could tell how the students really feeling, you could tell if they are faking emotions, and it could be a learning tool.

First, you could tell how the students are really feeling. In paragraph 9, the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means if a teacher sees an upset student, the teacher can tell them to make a happy face and eventually the student won't be as upset. It would help everyone be happy because everyone will ""... unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

Second, it would help show if anyone is faking emotions. In paragraph 8, the author says ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would also be helpful with students in a classroom because if student his trying a student is trying to hide being upset a teacher could know and then ask them whats wrong. Also, it would work the other way too. The teacher would know if a student would be faking being upset.

Lastly, it could be used as a learning tool. It could be a way of showing how facial muscles work and the emotions that are shown by them. In paragraph 6, the author states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that it would be able to help students learn based off of their emotions.

There many things in the new technology that would be valuable in a classroom with students. For instance, it help tell how students are feeling. Also it could tell if a student is faking a smile and is really upset. Finally, it would be a helpful learning tool by changing lessons by the students emotions. Next time you see a facial expression try telling what emotion that it applies to.",3,7,0.8376295566558838
06aa059,"I do not approve to let people use any type of technology to read emotions. That is when it gets weird and people ask why are you feeling this way. This can sometimes lead to the student getting even sadder or madder than they were. If they are left alone and no one knows what is wrong, they will be fine.

To start off, expressions can not forsure tell what that person is feeling. I have seen people so mad but continue throughout their day like everything is fine. Plus, if that student is just doing a fake smile, that does not mean that they are really happy. The FACS can not read emotions but reads the emotions it thinks you are feeling because of what your facial expression is.

Therefore, to end my argument, in paragraph 9 it says that contracting your smile muscles can help you feel slightly happy. This means it can make you SLIGHTLY happy but not enough to classify yourself as happy and I do not approve to let people read emotions. It is unnecessary and we should be researching something better than this.               ",2,7,0.8292657732963562
06e2db4,"For years and years, it has been said that emotion comes from the ""heart"", when really, emotions are scientific. In a classroom setting, many students feel as if they are in an uncomfortable environment, causing them to become silent and unable to ask questions. With the use of the technology called Facial Action Coding System, the teacher is able to modify what they are teaching to ensure everybody, even those who are quiet, understand. This new technology will offer students who are shy the same education as those who are not, modify a lesson for a certain student who is confused, and allow for a more positive environement in a classroom, making it valuable for students.

When eighteen girls and fifteen boys are put into a classroom, it is not always guranteed that they will have a friend in the class. Many times, when children do not feel welcome in an environment, they will not speak up or ask a question. This causes teachers to be unable to help the student understand what they are trying to learn. In the excerpt, ""Movement of one or more muslces is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, dear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'Alto 3). The technology is able to deeply read the expressions people make due to the movement of the muscles in the face. When someone has an emotion, sometimes, they unawarely show it. With FACS, the program can analyze that emotion , and give the feedback to the teacher to allow he/she to go back over the material that the student gave an emotion to. With the use of this technology, teachers can see how the students are feeling, without having to pull the answers out of the students who rarely talk.

The first thing most people notice when meeting someone for the first time or thousandth time is body language. It is scientifically proven that when someone is public speaking or talking, the focus is 90% body language/tone, and 10% material they are covering. From the way their voice is, or the way their face falls, a lot of information can be given. The new technology Facial Action Coding System allows for a computer to go deeper in analyzing the emotion of the face. A normal person is not going to immediately recognize that when the ""your oribularis oris, which is the muscle around your mouth tightens, it means you are showing anger""(D'Alto). The new program is able to analyze the muscles to give more of a precise and accurate reading of the emotion. Teachers meet students for 53 minutes a day, and are not mind readers who know how their students are feeling. The author claims, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'""(D'Alto 6). Since technology is the new way of learning this century, the computer's ability to be able to recognize confusion, and help modify the lesson to help increase understanding would be very valuable. There are many times when teachers let students go off and do the notes online, and many students may not catch on. With the ability to see they are not understanding, the student will not be forced to ask the teacher, but have the computer explain it. This would substantially help the students who are afraid of questions, and those who are absent from class. Having an instructor that knows every emotion that a student is feeling, and be there if modification is needed, would have a major impact on the succsess rate of students.

As more and more technology is being woven into todays ways of learning, it is important that it is grows along with the generation. Many times, students come into class with a ""I do not want to be here"" attitude. With attitudes like that, it decreases the success of the student. In the excerpt, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.....Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(D'Alto 9). Teachers could use these known tactics and have their students practice certain facial expressions to make them feel a certain way. If they are able to make the students smile, and it can allow for a slight feeling of happiness, resulting in a more positive environment. Students will participate more when put into an environment they feel welcome, and warm in, and by using the FACS program to see if they begin to feel happy, teachers can enforce more postivity in the classroom. The positive the classroom, the more particpation there is from students.

Although this program may not be 100% accurate since it doesn't know every emotion in the universe or what is going on in the person's brain, it can help teachers realize the basic emotions needed to see if their students are understanding. This new technology will offer students who are shy or quiet the same education as anyone else, allow for a more positive environment, and modify a lesson for a certain student if confused, overall making it very valuable for students in the classroom.

06ed983,"In the aricle ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions. Details I found from in the article show that computers can read a persons emotions. It can also tell from a painting or a video. It tells us in the beginging of the paragraph 1 that in the Mona Lisa paiting it shows emotion. According to the new computer software that can read emotions they tested it on paiting. She shows 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 perecent ferful, and 2 percent angry.

I believe this new technology is valuable for our use. It can give us bettter ways to explore and to communicate with computers. It tells us in the artilcle that computers can actually ""calculate"" emotions. It can recognize how a human feels and how humans express themselves. A psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman a creator for FACS constructed a 3-D computer model of a face and all major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. One or more muscles that move is called a ""action unit"". An example, your pfrontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyues) raise your eyuebros when your surprised or shocked .

Using video imagery, the new emotion-regonition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. Humans perform this same impressice ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her or his face. I think to read the emotional expressions of students in classroom is impressive. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It could also make computer animated faces more clear and expressive for video games video surgery. But also most humans communicate in nonverbal, including emotional communicaton.

I think the use to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable. It can help them in the classroom if there confused or distracted. It could really help a lot more then just students in a classroom. I think it could be used around in daily life maybe at a hostpital or military. This is why i think the Facial Action Coding System and technology is valuable.            ",3,7,0.8805479407310486
071de41,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" a technology called Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because knowing the emotions of students can help others in the classroom to react to that emotion appropriately depending on what the program identifies. This would allow people in a classroom to communicate more effectively, know when something may be wrong and should change, and display empathy towards one another. Being able to know how someone feels helps to complement those emotions. If a classmate was feeling happy, sad, angry, or any other emotion, and it was known it would be much easier to know how to approach them than it would be without the knowledge showing why this infromation could be valuable.

Knowing how another person feels makes it less difficult to communicate with them and communication is important in a classroom. In the text the author talked about how the program could tell when a person is not truly conveying emotions.

The text says,""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

This information is useful to a classroom because it shows the true emotions or feelings of someone. If a student in a classroom said ""I understand"", but did not truely mean it a teacher could use this information to know that more teaching may have to be done for students to fully understand the topic being taught.

Another example from the text says,""facial expressions for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly)."" This quote from the text explains that there are many different ways to express emotion and because of this it may be harder for everyone to fully understand how someone feels based on facial expression. That is why this technology could be valuable so that everyone is fully understood and proper treatment can be given to complement emotions.

Things should change in a classroom when students feel unconnected to what is going on, but it is not easy for everyone to know just when students may feel out of place. A quote from the text says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Here in the text the article talks about the technology being able to tell when a student is bored and confused, and then being able to modify a lesson effectively.

With this technology students would gain a full understanding of a topic without needing to ask because of facial expressions. This would be very effective in a classroom as it makes sure that everyone gets to learn the way that they need to.

The text also says,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too."" This quote explains that not all communication is verbal and most is actually nonverbal.

This means that listening may not always be enough and it is important to see and feel how others feel proving why this technology can help a classroom.

By reading faces the technology can help convey one's feelings to another to help gain a full understanding.

By understanding how someone else feels it makes it easier to understand them.

The article says,""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

This quote talks about empathy and how it is important in knowing how to treat people. Using this in a classroom could helpl classmates and teachers get along better.

The use of facial recognition technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because knowing the emotions of students can help others in the classroom to react to that emotion appropriately depending on what the program identifies.

This helps people in a classroom to communicate more effectively, know when something may be wrong and should change, and display empathy towards one another.

If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

In conclusion having the FACS in schools would benefit kids and teachers greatly because they could see how their students are feeling and if they are confused in anyway, and they could see what the problem is and how they could fix it whenever they need to.    ",2,7,0.7599066495895386

Many people can often pull of a fake expression that is good enough for a computer to calculate, like in paragraph seven, which includes instructions on how to do a real smile compared to a fake smile.

Most people cover up cameras on their laptops,computers, and phones for privacy and safety. Anyone who would cover up their camera would most likely not want their face constantly being scanned to tell emotion or what they like and dislike.

My first thought on this opinion is that it must of took a while to actually build this and to think of the idea as to what you could use to figure it all out. When Dr. Paul Eckman built this he must of had to be thinking about other people and the concept of wanting to help others. In pargraph four it proclaims ""By weighing hte differnt units, the software can identitfy mixed emotions"". Dr. Eckman was on the right track building this because any human being can feel up to 3 emotions at once and he knew just that so he figured he would build it be able to detect not just one but mulitple.

In pargraph 5 it says ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial triat that conveys it"".

This being made is awesome because I don't know about you but most of the times i'm down or angery I don't like to tell people why or event talk about it being I will get even more upset no matter the size of the issue. The FACS is just the answer for helping a friend in need when you know they need the comfort but don't want to say anything.

There is so many good things about this new software that only genius could of thought of. A drama coach once made his kids practice making happy and sad faces due to actually feeling the emotions before they went on to a play. Placed before me in paragraph 9 ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" Did you know that actually listeing to you friends or parents when they say ""put on a happy face"" it may help. Study shows that this actually can make you happy and being happy is more of what we need in this world.

I highly agree with this article and give it a 10/10 considering it is a very kind think to do and not to mention a brillant idea.

This is becoming a reality for society today, as a new software, the Facial Action Coding System has promising results for understanding and catergorizing human emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System was created by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illnois and Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. The FACS first costructs a 3-D model of the face with all 44 face muscles. Movement of one or muscles is called an action unit. Dr. Paul Eckman, another creator of FACS, has ""classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated them with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles."" The FACS was tested on the Mona Lisa, and detected her as ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" A computer being able to understand human emotion would be groundbreaking, as ""most human communication is nonverbal, including, emotional communication."" We as humans have a variety of expressions, from huge ones to very subtle changes in mood. Computers need to understand these, along with the subtle facial movements that go with them. A extensive calculation is needed in order to acheive this goal. We humans perform this 'calculation' every day, as we can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face by taking their facial cues into consideration of their emotion. A comptuter that could a similar thing as such would know when you're happy or sad, and then react accordingly. If you were to smile at a Web ad, it would send a similar one. But if you frowned, the next one would be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Hunag predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would allow for a better learning environment and teaching skills for students.

The use of this technology would be outstanding and unbelievably helpful in the classroom. It could accurately identify a student's emotions and change the lesson plan to meet their own academic needs. This technology not only can identify emotions, but can help humans to react to them. With more expressive characters in video games and movies, humans can identify and repilcate such emotions, as we have empathy. Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions, and computers with the FACS software could allow for that and much more to occur. Technology as we know it today could be changed forever. If computers do acquire the FACS software, then it would be able to identify human emotions and adjust accordingly.",3,7,0.8962075114250183

All teenagers these days are very ""tech-friendly"". Therefore it would only make sense that we should incorporate some of these technological adavances

into the classroom so students could be more engaged during class. It would greatly improve many homework scores, quiz scores, and even test scores

thus overall having many improvements to their grades in all.

The new software "" Facial Action Coding System"" has been a huge technological improvement to this time.

In the passage it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements---in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotion."" This can show how in a classroom if students are being active during a lesson and participating. Or if they are dozing off somewhere else with the help of this technology then the computer can change its algorithms to change how the lesson is being taught therefore making the student pay attention during class.

In a classroom filled with some kids that just can't focus and/or do not understand then this technology can come into great use. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" the passage states. This technology could help students that have trouble with some classes or just are not paying attention whatsoever, in the passages it also states,

""Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With this technology it can highly improve on keeping the students attention at all times, this can help the students with making sure they know whats going on during class at all times instead of zoning out then missing something very cruical and overall messing alot of things up but instead keeping them highly engaged at all times.

In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is greatly valuable. The use of this technological advancement would greatly improve students comprehension of some classes in school that they might've not understood before. It would be more personalized to that specific person, the more confused you look the more different ways it would look to make sure you understand the concept. Thus making the student very proactive and improving their overall grade. ",3,7,0.851536214351654
07f4106,"Facial Action Coding System allows computers around humans to read their emotion based by the look on their face. Dr. Huang tells that this device can tell your emotion because of the muscles in your face and how they are either tightened or relaxed. FACS should be used on students so teachers can help them talk it out, help them understand the material that is being teached and help them learn the emotion of people around them.

Using FACS on students should be allowed. If using FACS in a classroom full of teenagers, a teacher will just see a room filled with hormonal teens. They will just ignore it and think they are just moody. Or a teacher could see how upset a student is and ask if they are okay. This computer could become useful in helping students when they are upset or angry. If could allow the teacher to talk to them and check up on them every once in a while. FACS can detect the six basic emotions such as surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer will detect these emotions through the movement of the muscles.

Teachers can use FACS to help students understand the subject more clearly. Learning and understanding school is very important to young students, they need the knowledge to go and be successful in the future. Teachers want to know if a student is getting confused while listening to a lecture. It is important for teachers to know how to help their students. This computer will help out with the use of studying and scaning how their facial muscles are being moved or how their eyebrows are being lifted.

Knowing how someone around another could help out a lot. If this FACS could really detect human emotions just from the expression on the face and movement of the muscles then it could help a human understand how the person next to them is feeling. Zygomatic major are the muscles that begin in your cheek bones, they life the corners of your mouth. That muscle can determined if someone is giving a forced smile or genuine smile. This could help a person know when another is upset and needs space or if another is in need of comforting. It could also help to see if someone is angry and needs time to cool down.

FACS is able to help people talk out the emotion they are feeling, help them understand material that is being taught to them and help them learn the emotion of people around them. FACS will be able to conclude a feeling of a person and will possibly be able to help someone. Knowing how someone is feeling is very important because then people will know how to appoarch them and how to talk to them. FACS would be very successful in helping others out and it could be used to know a person feels. ",4,7,0.8450348377227783

in my opinon i do not think their should be a machine that could read my emotions ever i belive privacy is important and the will for someone to express their emotions to someone whom they may care about is sometimes sacred or personal varying on the person. technology that tracks the way our muscles move could be used for other puposes the machine can even track if were angry and how our lips tighten around our mouth ,this other ways we could use such as facial recongtion, best said himself "" even though indiviuals showing varying degrees of expression"" these could identify someones facial muscles even if they had face suregy or we could use this as machinery as facial reconstructions benifts .if its able to identify muscles of every unique person even famous art work like the mona lisa then this could have other benifts we could even look into the past to tell how historical figures were feeling in paintings or older photos. or we also could use to know animals emotions and how we can make an animal have a better day or stop animal related accidents from happening such as animal attacks. One good reason is if women could know if how we really felt about that dress the one they asked our opinons about then the trouble comes. often times emotions are the reflection of the human spirit emotions are things that leads rebilons agaimts broken systems or start movements,emotions are what gives us the extra inch for the push, emotions soemtimes give a door to grieve, our even hold our opinons , see we have feelings inside that no one should look threw in todays society alot of mans virutues once held have gone, emotions are something that is deep imside us that we can hold onto , humanity always wants to know even it breaks or passes the limit but , if emotions were able to show they could stop so much possibilties , imagine if slave masters knew their slaves emotions, or britian during the american revoultion knew, emotitons is how cover ourselves .

But for me you can tell if an person is in a good mood or in a bad mood by the look on their face sometimes. But the crazy thing is that some people hide their problems away so you realy dont know what they are going through.

As a human bean you know when someone isnt feeling so good or they are feeling so good , and the only they you can do is ask them is they are alright or cool. But the big thing of all I dont think technology can read the emotion expression of people because its an computer and sometime computer be have mistakes and even diffuclts.

There millions of reason why it not valuable well for one a person could be looking happy in the picture but be reallly sad emotional . I see it everyday at in the world .Like for explain when someone die and they go to a furel you got to look cool or happy ,but on the inside your heart broken and never be the same . And you take a picture on a computer and it would say you are happen but you really not because computer don't know emontional they just know knowledge .

I mean don't get me wrong it a good tool it see people emotional . But that why we got eyes for , to look and see things .We dont need computer to see people emotional we can tell by the way a person talk . If that person sound like he or she got a additon (come back) that mean that person is in a bad mood and don't want to talk at that time . A computer wouldn't even know he or she in a good mood or not by the way they talk. Another good reason why it's not valuable.

Does computer even have emotional?

I don't think so but they can't tell people emotinal . Compuer don't know what true happence or sadness mean they just tell us whatever they programer put inside them. True happness is something you don't feel its just there . Sadness is somthing thats doesn't feel good something that hurts on the inside.

So yea computer really can't read people expressions just from the face . If it so great im looking in the computer now can you tell me my expression they probably say im sad but im not m just worry . to pass his test so yea computer are not valuable to expression for people emotional ",3,7,0.6775650978088379
084cdc4,"I think the computer the students are using to identify human emotions is valuable. It could useful for many things in the world or can use for important uses like if people are lying. This techology could be helpful to scientists for many uses or like in the article says for identify paints or surgeries. In the following paragraghs i will give my reason why its a good reason to the FACS and evidenece.

The reason i agree that they should have the FACS is because it could be used for alot of things like see who is confused or lost, and if someone is lying when they are introuble, and even if they need it for a painting like this artcle. I think people always questioned if mona lisa is happy or mad, or even confused. In the artricle on paragraph 3 it says that the computer can classifi if someone or some painting is happy, sad, anger, fear, and disgusted. So what they did is they made the painting 3-d and scanned her face to see what was her emotions were during da vinci was painting and also it says that the computer can also major 44 muscles on our face and can tell if we are happy or sad. on paragraph 1 the result of what emotion mona lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful andf 2% angry. this result could be right or just what the computer thinks what her emotion was in that very moment da vinci was painting her.

In conclusion i do think FACS is valuable because it could help figuring out emotions on people in paintings like da vinci, help during surgery, help the teacher know if people did understand the lesson or not, and help people know who is lying or not.",2,7,0.7538942694664001
08c6a31,"Using the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in a classroom. Many students often get bored, distracted, or just lose focus when being taught a lesson that doesn't interest them. Of course you can't just not learn the lesson, since you are learning because it will come to use later on. Therefore, I believe that with help from your computer screen, you could stay on track with your work.

Often times, teachers use different teaching styles based on what allows their students to learn most effectively. With the Facial Action Coding System, computers could do so, too. For example, say you're reading an excerpt on the computer and it's not really on a topic that interests you, most students would immediately lose attentiveness to the reading. This is not a good thing, especially if the information was important, useful, or for a grade. But, with the Facial Action Coding System, this problem could be solved. The system could be used to spice up the learning, or keep the teaching style stays the same way if the student is staying attentive.

Many people learn in a different way. Some students are more effectively taught by learning visually, others hands-on, and some verbally. The Facial Action Coding system could recognize these based on students facial expressions. If the student is looking focused while seeing a diagram, the system could see they're a visual learner, and keep teaching the topic in that way. Otherwise if that doesn't work, the system could see if the student's emotions would change based on if they could listen to the information instead of reading.

Based on the positive characteristics of the Facial Action Coding System, I believe we should have the technology at school. The system could really be put to use, especially if it could help students learn and understand topics in an easier way. The emotion reading technology would be extremely valuable to have in a classroom.   ",4,7,0.7656521201133728
08cdf6e,"We all hide our emotions at one point or another but, what if we had the technology that could detect whatever were feeling despite if were trying to hold them in or not. The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is just that piece of technolgy that is capable of detecting any given emotion. Dr. Huang inventor of this software has even modified it to were it can find out any emotion or emotions all at once. It's been questioned should this kind of technolgy be used in classrooms for students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in the classroom because, if any student is having troubles on the actvity at hand the Facial Action Coding System could detect that modify the prompt and make it easier for the student to then understand. Second, this software could help you better understand someone and their well-being being able to see exactly what's making them happy and what's making them upset. Third, it's better way for human and computers to ""communicate or interact"".

Anybody couldn't say that they haven't had problems understanding something at any given point in time. Simpily because, everyone can't understand everything right away with no problem/obstacle getting in the way weither it being how the words are phrased or if the vocabulary is too hard to comprehend. FACS could solve this issue right away. As presented in the passage ""Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" therefore making it easier for the student or user to understand what is being asked or written. Solving probems much quicker than the instrustor could explaining the information piece by piece.

Understanding emotions when communicating with someone is key. Yet, we might not recognize all that are being distrubed to us. Another great reason for FACS to come into play. As stated in the passage ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This is all very true we can't comprehend every emotion that's more dull or hidden. So why don't we get a little help at recognizing more emotions. With FACS we can better understand someones true feelings inside and their well-being. This can than lead to possibly help solving some of the persons unsolved issues and other ""troubling thoughts."" Helping them become of the better verison of themselves.

In our generation today technolgy is something that we live and breath. It's important that we become familair with technolgy and being able to use it properly and effectifly. ""Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate."" Now isn't this perfect? Huang can help us better understand computers and help computers better understand us. If students will be using computers 24/7 why not have the proper setup for them. If the software gets used in the way it's meant to it can overall have a positive effect towards the situation. After some time the computer can develop how the student or user works and operates and what they can understand and can not. Having a large postitive impact. Greater increasing the student's grades, confidence, and potentional in class. Allowing them to fully understand the content be covered better than they would ever before.

In conculsion, the Facial Action Coding System or FACS is valuable in the students classroom because, it can modify the content of the information to be better understood. Being able to see and recognize more emotions for peers. Lastly it can help the user better ""communicate"" with the computer. ",5,7,0.907698392868042
08dcd91,"Current education in schools are based on standardlized education with all student having simmilar classes, even if student are confused or bored with class. Which could cause more possibility to fall credits. Because of these problems, the recognizing emotional expressions of student by computer are valuable to prevent left behind than other students.

The emotion recognition technology could bring more computer based education with more personalized class even if one of the student are confused or bored. According to Professor Thomas Huang, from Beckman Institite for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, this technology brings ability to ""Classroom computer could recognize when student is becoming confused or bored"" and ""Modify the lesson, like an effective human instuructor"". Computer emotion recognition techology could bring more ability to make class attractive and prevent student from falling their grades and credits or even giving advanced education for each person.

Also, faking emotion recognition technology is difficult. According to ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, if someone is trying to fake smile, ""mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius"" which makes sytem to recognize false smile. From this technology, with educatuional purpose such as recognizing emotional expressions to prevent left behind student, this will give another creditbility to system even if student tried to deny their actual feelings, such as confuse.

The emotion recognizing software would be valuable to prevent many student from falling grades. The facial recognization have some of problems such as teachers could be easily unempolyed, or privacy problem.

08fa0b3,"When we use facial expressions it lets the person you are directing the expressions to know how we are feeling. We smile because we are happy, we frown because we are sad, we raise our eyebrows because we are shocked or surprised. We use usually identify those pretty well, but a computer can identify them better. I am for the value of using techology to read student's emotional expressions because teachers need to know what bores them or what excites them.

When I first began to read this, I thought how can technology read our emotions? Then it states in paragraph 3 that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. With all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. This computer can identify 6 basic emotion: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. With that type of skill, teachers can know what students like and don't like.

Students get easily bored when it comes to school. When they come into the classroom, they don't want to do the homework or the classwork that was given to them. They want something that will entertain them and help them learn at the same time. With this new technology, student's facial expression will be identified when they like or don't like something. Teachers then can change the way the lesson is taught without changing the lesson at all as told in paragraph 6.

This is a new way to change how schools teach. More students would want to come to school and teachers would have an increase in successful students. Knowing what we didn't know is creating more ideas to the future. ",3,7,0.8992858529090881
09e6583,"The Facial Action Coding System being applied for a student in the classroom can lead to many benefits and improvements in the classroom. This system could be applied in way that help develop the learning and how to teach the student to be more interactive in the classroom. Ways that this Coding System can be used to improve students in a classroom in that the System can determine whether or not a student is interactive in the class, if a student is cheating or lying, or whether things outside of school are affecting/bothering the student.

One way that this Facial Action Coding System can benefit the teacher and student is whether or not the student is interactive in the class. If the Facial Action Coding System were to take pictures of the student throughout the class and see what kind of emotions students are experiencing throughout the class, this could actually help the teacher. For example, if the student shows expressions of happiness throughout the class, then the teacher should continue her approach of learning, because happier student tend to be more interactive in the class. If the Facial Action Coding System were to analyze students feeling disgust or sadness throughout the class, this would be beneficial for the teacher in that this implies the teacher needs to change their approach and if the teacher were to question the student, how and what they (the teachers) can do to allow the students to be more interactive. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (Huang, paragraph 6). This shows that even online learning could be changed using this Coding System and that using this technology would be beneficial throughout different kinds of learning systems and different kinds of students. Also, as I said before, if the Coding System is able to detect students feeling bored or becoming confused in class, it may lead to the teacher changing his approach on how to teach the lesson.

Also, the Facial Action Coding System could also be helpful in that the system could help teacher find cheaters and dishonest students in the class. An example of this is that if the Facial Action Coding System were to detect fear or surprise if a teacher confronts a student on cheating, this will help the teacher on deciding if the teacher actually cheated or whether the student was actually innocent. Also if the student decides to lie and fake an happy expression, the machine would also be able to detect this. This author states the system is able to detect a fake expression when he states, ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus makes crow feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the smile is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; thes muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" (D'Alto, paragraph 8). This quote shows that the machine to detect a faked expression and if the student is lying or faking an expression, the teacher will be able to call him out on it using the Facial Action Coding System.

The Facial Coding System could also detect whether things outside of school is affecting him and whether or not the student need help. For example, if the student were constantly to have a sad and fear expression throughout the school, the counselor/principal may be able to ask the student what is going on and why the student constantly is feeling this type of way. The counselor/principal may discover things that could be traumatizing to the student and proceed to get the studen help or aid.

In conclusion, having a Facial Action Coding System may be beneficial for both the student and the teacher in a classroom. With this system, teachers are able to identify whether they should change the way the way they teach the class, if a student is faking an expression when caught cheating or lying in the classroom, and if something is concerning a student outside of school. All of these reasons prove that schools should start implementing this new system into their technology such as video cameras, computers, and tablets. ",4,7,0.7915038466453552

I'm explaining what I think about people using a facial recognition. This whole facial recognition thing is awesome and I think that it is safe for us humans. These people can actually use it for there iphones now. For example a person uses a facial recognition for his phone,that's good because because can't nobody else can get into his device.

The thing about it is who was the person to come up with this idea I think its cool but there using up all this technology. I think that there is a reason for everything and I wonder what made that that person come up with that idea. Another reason why I think this is a cool idea is because it knows who you are even when you have on different face expression. That's amazing how a computer can express how we feel .I 'm so surprized that a computer can do that. I some time ask myself how do they do that.

I think that computers would need a lot of energy to do that I don't know it's amazing. I sometimes think that it is not impossible for this to happen but it really is. I think about all the gadgets that my mom had back then. I would usually say that they're going to make alot of different things in the future. Their already trying to make self-driving cars.

This story is amazing. I think that there are going to be more things that are going to surprise me. This one is the first greatest techonolgy I ever heard about. When I grow up I dont want to use all of this technology because I think that it is to much for me. I would consider only using something simple.

This story told me alot. It told me what a computer could do that i never knew about which is surprizing. I just told my story about how i'd feel about all this new technology.

0a28113,"I think the Facial Action Coding System to identify human emotions is not a good idea because some people might be keeping things from other people that might make them sad, mad, or disgusted about someone and then there will be a problem with those people. But also this could be a good thing because it could help with what people are going though in there life. And this could help cuicide problems for alot of places.

This might be a bad thing because it could cause conversy with people and might split people apart from there family, friends, or co-workers. For an example if two people are in a relationship and if one person is disgusted, mad, or sad and the other might ask what they are disgust, mad or sad at the other personor something. And because they did Mona Lisa it doesn't give an good example and it only shows the positive side and if did this on a high school student like they want to it might show more of a negitive responsed.

But in other terms this could be a good thing for some people because it could help people with what they are going though in there life. This could also possible lower the number's of cuicide percent for some places and mostly for people. It could lower places cuicide rates by if they mad, disgusted or sad people could ask what they are though and maby get that thing of there cheat could be a good thing for them. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and2 percent angry"" this shows that it does indeed work and if were going to do it a different person or painting you will get different percent's that will better understand what some people might be going though in life.

I truely think this could be made for good reasons if used right and not for only student but people all around the world s we could see what is going on someother places. But if it used to much it could start some bad things with student, familys, and co-workes.",3,7,0.7641993761062622

I don't think this software would be valuable in the classroom because it is invading the kids personal space. Having the teachers or the computers always knowing how you feel is creepy. In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Simle"" it states that humans perform this task or calculation of reading people's emotions everyday.

The reason why the the Facial Action Coding System would be bad idea for school is the cost. Where will the school get the money from for them to get this high technology from. Who will be the paying for them. If somthing was to brake on the Facial Action Coding System it would cost a arm and a leg to get it fixed just because the high technolgoy used to make it.

We need these in the class room! if we had the new technology in the class room we love it ,because when you get bored the technology would recoernized that and will swicth to something else.If you are still un happy the technology will know and will keep switch to it see a change in emoition.If you are still un happy the technology could even put up a smiling face to make you smile, because sometimes all you need is a good smile.

I think the new technolgy is a good resource for the classroom and can really help and improve the education in the class room.",3,7,0.883765697479248
0ad0588,"Facial expressions can tell a lot about you, but do you really know what your facial expression is actually showing? Well being all about the new technology will tell you a lot about your self. Being about the technology will tell you about facial expressions, how the muscles in your face can tell how you really feel, and how the technology works for people. This technology will tell how a person really feels.

Facial expressions can tell a lot about a person and how they might feel. When someone is frowning others may think that your mad or sad. But when someone is smiling others may think that they are happy or excitied. Facial expressions can tell a lot about people but noone really knows what the true facial expresson is. When a person is happy they might simle, when a person is scared they might make a frightened facial expression. Each facial expression means something different.""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."".

Muscles on your face tell what expression a person is using. Someone who is smiling muscles are shaped different from when they are sad or mad. Depending on how you feel is the way your muscles are shaped. ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above our eyes) raises your eyebrows when your surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."", said Dr. Paul Eckman.

You may be wondering how this technology works and what it really does. Well ""this process begins when the vcomputer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."". ""Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit.."". "" There are six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fera, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles."" By weighting different units, the software can even indentify mixed emotions, meaning that the weight of it can tell. Each one of the expressions that are used are compared to neutral faces.

Imagine if a computer can tell weather your confused or mad or even sad. What if when it could tell what facial expression you was meaning it woud change to your intrest. This technology could help a lot of people. For an example it could help school kids become more intrested in school work if it could tell you was bored and made it more intresting. By showing the students facial expression this technoloy can better the student just by changing it into something that makes it better for them.",3,7,0.7489120960235596
0b23a57,"I think that sometimes it would be good to use FACS, but at the same time, it would also be smart to not use it all the time. FACS is a Facial Action Coding System that detects the way someone is feeling. It can tell if you are feeling sad, happy, energetic or tired, just by your actions. I think we should only use it if we HAVE to, otherwise, just use our human instincts and look at each other to tell how one another is feeling.

I believe we should use FACS if it is a necessity. If someone is showing signs or actions that are just merely impossible to interpret, then yes, we should use FACS. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" says Dr. Huang. If someone is just smiling kind of broadly, like the article tells us, and not really showing us if they are smiling or not, I believe that is a time that we should use FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Some people though, think that we should not use it, and I agree with them just a little bit.

When should we not use it? I think times that we should not use it are when it is easy to tell the way someone is feeling, or if someone has a medical problem that would be affected by this. We also should not use this if you are at home. I know that in today's age, most homes probably don't have a PC that hooks into the wall anymore. Nowadays, most homes just have a laptop that everyone will share, and they will call it a home computer. Either that, or most people probably just have their own personal laptops. What I am trying to say though, is that we should not use it at home because as the article say, a home PC could not handle the complex algorithms that FACS requires.

Now, if you are one of those people who are somewhere in the middle, you don't know if we should use it or not, I would say just look at how it works. All FACS does, we as human can pretty much do ourselves. It just takes movements that you do, and then says what it thinks your emotion is that you are feeling. But, if you think about it, we can do that do as humans. So, there might be one reason that you start leaning more towards not using it. You might start to think again though if you think about what i said earlier. If someone is smiling broadly, we can't really tell how they are feeling. So, that might be a time that you would say use it.

Now, even after looking at all of this information, I will probably always be one of those people who just don't know if it would be good or not to use it. If you don't, then you would just use your human instincts and try to tell what someone is feeling. You might just be one of those people who likes to do everything old school. If you do, then that must mean you just don't want to try to tell what someone is feeling. This could be laziness, but who knows. Maybe that is a time that you should use FACS.

0b2bfc4,"This artical is about, FACS (Facial Action Coding System), which is a new software

that has been developed, it improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. This computer software was made so a computer can detect your emotions to understand what you like and dont like. The author states that, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.""

I believe that we should use this process on computers at the schools, so that the computers better understand the schools students. The author states that, ""This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of industries."" This software can express many different emotions such as, happy, mad, sad, ect. It can also store infromation, as to what you like and what you dont like, by the way your muscles movwe in your face. In paragraph 5, the author states, ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical infromation as electronic code."" It can also help a student if he/she is having trouble on the computer, it can do that by reading the emotions on your face by the way your facial muscles move in a certain way. The author states in paragraph 6 that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

The author wrote the article, FACS (Facial Action Coding System), to help computers camunicate better with humans, by reading the way their muscles on their face move, or react, to express how humans feel. This new computer software would be a good thing to add to the schools computers, that way the computers can better communicate, and help, the students if they are confused or bored. Even if you have different face expressions, or mixed emotions. the auther says, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). Computers need to be able to better communicate with humans.",4,7,0.846347987651825
0b700a7,"Would you want somthing that reads your emotions and finds out weather you are happy, sad or depressed. If so read more to find out some more information about this device to see if you would want this at your job or school.

The reason why this can be a major impact in the class room is that it can read your facial expresstions. Teachers can see if students are struggling or if they are goofing off in class. Teachers can use this type of tool in the class roon to see what they can't see from their desk. This device can read six emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also can associate with peoples movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weightign the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpice). Each expresstion is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

We has humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/hers face. Of course, msot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that the facial recognitinal machine works wonderfuly and would be amazing in any class room.

In conclustion, i belive that this device should be in schools all round that United States. My reasoning is when people come in the school that system can do backround checks on parents or adults that come into the buliding. That makes sure they keep the school safe for teachers and students in the process of everyone else in the building at that time. Plus they can have data that will be saved for when they know when that person can to the school and left the school.        ",2,7,0.857256293296814
0b869b2,"Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valueable. It can help actors learn how to make a smile or frown look real, it can help a teacher figure out if a student needs more help just by scanning his or her face, and it can help us figure out what our friends are realling feeling.

First, movies are a big part of our life. It is never fun to go to watch a movie and see that the actors arent good they either look like they dont know what they are doing or they try looking sad and actually look like the happest person on earth. with this technology like the arthour says "" Drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage"". This shows that even just practicing a fake smile for a movie or for when you are on stage could make the play seem better than it already would be of the actors didnt know how to put on a real smile.

Facial action coding system can also be helpful in the class room so when you have a kid on the computer you can see if they are strugging and they need more help or if they are powering through it and need a bit more of a obsticle to go through. like in in the article "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confussed or bored...it could then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could help a teacher out cause they cant always tell of a student is having trouble. they also dont always see the when they are doing their work at home. This is like the teachers second hand man when coming to helping students get the help or challenge they need.

Lastly, you may have a friend that you cant tell if they are sad or happy because . The article states "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"". You never if a friend is putting on a fake smile to keep you from getting down, but thats just hurting them even more so you sometimes have to do things yourself and get them the help they need.

In conclusion, I believe that being about to see someones emotion just by scanning their face could be very helpfull to get kids the help they need or the challenge, helping a friend get through a rough time, and making movies better. ",4,7,0.8230166435241699

Only because we have so many different ways that we communicate to one another.

""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?""

That quote from the story almost explains why that would be a big problem for the computers.

But trust me computers would be very valuable in classrooms on the positive side but on the negative side it just gives another thing to go wrong in a classroom.

I mean don't we already have enough technology in classrooms to helps us out and distract us.

Plus what if the scaner just decided to start malfunctioning and get the wrong facial scans then you could be feeling one way, but the computer could say another.

And who says that a computer tells you how you feel only you and you only knows how you really feel.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.""

What this quote does to theargument is it sort of shows that it would be extremely hard for the computer to know how each and every single persons own facial movements.

And a computer probably cant tell you how your feeling even though you might not even know yourself how you feel.

""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his or her face.""

This quote from the story also shows that humans can figure out faster that a computer how someone is feeling even if they are have mixed feelings.

But we also have the ablility over a computer to be able to communicate to one another about our own emotions.

The bottom line is that you cant program every single human emotion into on single computer no a million computers.

Becasue not everyone is always feeling one emotion inside at all times.

We humans feel mutiple emotions at all times.

For instance you get and a on a test that you really might have need to pass and you start to cry but they arent tears of sadness they are tears of joy.

And a computer will see the tears and say that this perons is sad when really that person is so overwhelmed by happiness that they cried tears of joy.",3,7,0.7735031843185425

If a student is in the subject of photography or painting anything artistic FACS would be very useful indeed, but if a student has no interest in any part of it they will not take it serious. Now someone who is starting a business or wants to pursue a sream and be a great artist such as Leanardo da Vinci they will find FACS helpful, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, For example if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a smiliar ad might follow."" It will allow them to see how a client feels about the artists work or how they're feeling that day maybe it's not a good day to take photos or such. The work that goes into FACS is great the ways they compare a persons facial muscles to a photo with no emotion to simply see the difference that much easier. Taking anatomy would be such a good help if intrested and to make it way easier to figure out a persons facial changes that much eaiser. ""Studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey a specific emotions."" FACS a good project that was developed but it has no big use for students, their feelings shouldn't be forced if you're doing something for the student they should go ahead and be open about it ""MOst human communication is nonverbal, including emotinal communication."" allow someone to see how they truly feel. An artist could get their feelings hurt by working with a client and then seeing how they truly feel about their work or about doing the project. You can't really just get emotions from someone with a quick snapshot you really have to put work in taking the photo so you get their true emotions.

0c9e34e,"The emotional expressions in a classrooom is valuable because many people have many different expressions. Using technology would be a good idea to tell the different types of expresions because imagine someone being really mad and you did not know. I think technology would be a good idea because they could have many different options to choose from.

For example on paragraph 3 it gives really good reasons on why technology would be good. It show that a computer can construct a 3-Dmodel face showing all 44 mucles in our face and it would move like actual human muscles. The movement of our muscles are called action units. We have would have six emotions to tell to someone and a computer could do it all by its self.

We humans may have the same expression on a daily day basis because most of the time we are not happy consedering the fact that most of our facial expressions are angry, sad , happy , surpris fear, and disgust, so this means that with just a computer you can do anything when it comes to facial expresions. Also on paragraph 4 it says that '' using video imagery'' would be really good to tell the emotions through facial movements or on a painting like Mona Lisa. A new software would be good to tell the facila emotions for example like on the masterpice of da Vinci that the expressions are compared to the natural face of a person.

This idea of computer emotional expressions would be a good one because with just a scan or a picture would be great because they wouldn't have to be asking the person what is wrong with them. I think this would be way much easy to tell wheather the person is mad, sad, or surprised this idea would work also on pictures that may not show no expressions

In my opinion i think this would cause good controversials because your emotions would simply be easy to reach like in Mona Lisa picture. Your expression can change real quick as to when your standing in the mirror or when you are really happy , sad, or mad. This would help for when a person is showing a fake smile or when a celebrity is being truthful with the camras.

0cdf1ff,"Having a new technology that can detect facial expression is not valuable in classrooms. Having technology that can detect when a student is enjoying a specific lesson or action, is not valuable due to the fact that the student's facial expression may have more to do with than just the lesson being learned. The Facial Action Coding System would be able to tell if a student is sad or happy, or frusterated, or disgusted. But it does not have the technology to determine prior emotions, or the cause of them. Therefore, Facial Action Coding Systems are not valuable in classrooms. However they may be useful elsewhere, such as doctors offices, and airports.

Although the author gives a practical use of his product, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a studnet is becoming confused or bored."" Students go through a fair amount of stress throughout the year, and can witness or partake in many activities which can be detromental. This is where the author's claim is no longer valid.

For instance, maybe a second grader gets into school one day, and is distrought because his or her mom and dad got in a divorce the night prior. This is a scenario where the Facial Action Coding System is not going to be able to benefit the kids learning based off of his or her facial expressions. Another example includes highschoolers. What if a boy or girl is being bullied and not reaching for help and bottling all of their emotions in. A system that recognizes facial expression would not be worth having at that time because the system would base its opinion off of what the student is learning, even if the student may be enjoying what they are learning. This is just one case where the Facial Action Coding system would not be valuable.

Although the Facial Action Coding System may not be useful in school classrooms, their is practical application outside of the classroom. For instance, what if a little kid gets signed out of school because they are sick. The mom would most likely take the kid to the doctors to get them examined, if they are truly sick the Facial Action Coding System may be useful to tell if the kid is truly sick, or if they are most likely faking it, prior to the actual visit with the doctor. It may also be useful in principals offices. The Facial Action Coding System may be of use when a student makes a report. If the students emotions can be told as angered, or distraught, it may further prove that the student is actually being truthful, not just trying to get someone in trouble.

Another great use of the Facial Action Coding System is in airports around the world. The system could be of use to tell if someone is of threat or is in an unstable condition prior to boarding the plane. Airport officials could analyze reults of suspected threats before allowing them on a plane. This application would be more practical than it being used in classrooms.

Although I believe that the Facial Coding System is not of use in classrooms, the technology would be great if applied elsewhere. The authors opening sentence in paragraph nine may be the solution to classrooms. ""Putting on a happy face actually works.""

The Facial Action Coding System help the teachers identify the emotion of their students. The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy.

The first reason is the Facial Action Coding System is valuable because it help the teachers identify the emotion of their student. It said in the article ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Some of the students in the school won't talk about how they are feeling in the classroom, and some of them would be scared to ask question when they are confused. The new technology would help the teachers so much on how to find out if their students are understanding the works they did in the classroom.

The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. Everybody in this world needs someone that could tell if they were happy or sad, so they would feel like someone is understanding them at lest. "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". These are the great things Eckman has classified that can help us and make us smile.

The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy. Sometime we can tell that the person is happy or sad, but we can't not tell it all the time. We can makes the wrong assumption about a person by the look on their face.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. So we need the new technology to help telling us about a person feeling.

0e8864c,"Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again. The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is unbelievably valuable.

Technology in the classroom has already begun to advance rapidly with educational websites such as ; Google Classroom, Edulastic, Khan Academy,and Mathia. The facial recognition technology could enhance a students comprehension to maximum potential. In the passage "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts.""then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,""notes Dr. Huang."". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.

Many parents or administrators may not agree that this sounds real or possible, but the logic is right before our eyes. In the text the author states how the technology performs the task of reading emotional appeals. For example, in paragraph 3 line 1 the author says,""The process begins when the com puter constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". So apparently this process goes beyond just looking at the face,but actually looking for the movements in facial muscles. The author also talks about the muscles that present certain emotions such as the ; the muscles above your eyes (frontalis oars lateralis) raise when you're surprised,the muscles around your mouth (orbicularis oris) tightens your lips when you're angry, and more. This shows that the computer breaks facial expressions down to a science.

So now what do you think? Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning. Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms. Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before! The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education.",4,7,0.8665481805801392
0ec99dd,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile ,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Now for this techology to be used in the classroom I have mixed feelings on weather this is appropriate to use. In the other hand it could potentially increase the student body to be more compatiable with being in school and truly enjoying the enviorment and space that they are in. Due to the fact that the teachers know how the students feel or mentally react to on what is happining.

The reason that I feel that this should not be used in school is the fact that it violates all of the personal and private feelings of a student and the lack of emotions it can tell, According to the text it states "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger , disgust, fear and sadness"". There are more emotions than that. One out of the six actually represent something good and happy the other five are more on the sad and unhappy emotions. Another quote from this article states "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". If that is true then there would no point in for an emotion to tell you how they truly feel. There is nothing better than another warm blodded person with emotions aswell to say something such as hey i can understand what your going through I feel the same way you didn't have to tell me but I knew.

On the other side of the spectrum and saying how this could benifit the students and the teachers is how to make the class or more engaging to the students. As stated in the article "" "" A classroom computer could recpgnize when a student is becoming confused or bored ,"" Dr. Haung predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" "" That could help a lot of students especially the ones eho normally dont like school. Plus this machine will potentially make you happier stated in the article "" The Mona Lisa demonstration is realy intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much this computer can do."" This coul help people with persay deppresion and confusion on making a choce or big decision on something.

This manchine the "" Facial Action Coding System"" could help with you arround your freinds or a crush/ significant other on how they truly feel twoards something. Aswell as trying or attempting to make them feel better. In the article stated it sites "" For instance, you could probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"" This could say help the autistic kids who cant read emotions or conversation ques, and understand them so they dont hurt somebodys feelings. Furthermore, the text states "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them. "" Doing so could help your freind whos having a bad day have a happier one or a loved one because thinking and trying to be happy will actually make you happy.

In conclusion in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I have personaly mixed emotions about this being used in schools as seen. Then again my overal feel of this is posiitive and sholud be regulated within schools.

0ed8aad,"It seems that technology gets upgraded yearly. Recently, Apple has created a software called Animoji. This software allows you to have an emoji replicate your facial actions. This ties into the new software, the Facial Action Coding System. This software analyzes your face and can tell you how much percent happiness, anger, sadness, fear, suprise, or even disgusted you are displaying. Since we already have facial recognition, why not have the software to tell you your mood. This software would benefit education and provide a safer area for students through recognizing extreme signs of depression or anger.

Our mood can either help or damage our learning processes in school. If you are in a bad mood, you will not care as much as you would if you were happy. This software would be very benificial for any classroom. Having this software could help students learn. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huand predicts. Then, the software could modify the lesson to suite the students need. This software could boost the students grades, because the students would be more focused or not get confused due to the Facial Action Coding System. Not only will the software boost the students education, it could also help the school identify if someone is extremely depressed or angry. This software could prevent anything drastic from occurring. It could prevent suicide, shootings, fights and all sorts of things. It could save someones life, if not many peoples lives.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System can benefit our education and learning processes in numerous ways. It can recognize when a student is confused, and then it could modify the lesson to help the student understand the topic. It could also recognize when a student is bored, and then modify the lesson to be more interesting. It could improve the school's awareness to when a student is extremely depressed. It could also improve the school's awareness to when a student is extremely angry. The shool could then help the students who are depressed or angry to prevent anything drastic from happening.

0f22798,"Many people go through many different emotions throughout their day. They show their emotions with facial expressions which also let's other people around them know what their current feelings could be. Although some people's expressions are hard to read due to them not showing emotion in their face or hiding it,they can go through a process in a computer system named 'Facial Action Coding System' in other words FACS ,which makes the computer determin their feeligs. This is also a good system for when historians are trying to figure out old pantings like The Mona Lisa. This computer system can work well because it determins a persons feeling,it can help make better computer-animated faces more expressive,and it can help modify a teaching lesson according to the student liking.

First the computer system can tell what a person's feelings are. In paragraph four it read ""By weighting the different units,the software can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared againts a neutral face"". Another example can be found in paragraph five, it talks about how the computer software stores simliar codes to figuring out emotions and also talks about Da Vinci studing human anatomy to help him paint human facial expressions. These two examples show somewhat how the computer system works and how effective it when it comes to facial expressions.

Secondly FACS can help develope better computer-animated facial expressions. In paragraph six it read ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery"" Another example is found in paragraph three when the author talks about 3-D computer models of the faces. He also talks about the muscles used when we make an expression. This two examples can show how FACS can help figuring out which facial expression is used and how to demonstrate it more strongly.

Lastly FACS can help figuring out lessons based on the students facial expression. In paragraph six it said ""A classroom computer cpu;d recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor. Another example is found in paragraph four when the author talks about individuals showing vary degrees of expression making it hard to tell exactly what they feel. This examples show that knowing a students main emotion to a lesson can help modify a special lesson making them enjoy it better and learning more.

In conclusion FACS can be very usual when it comes to determening and knowing exacly one's feeling. It can also be useful when historians need to figure out emotions people felt during erlier times based on a panting. FACS also can show the many different moods a persons facial expression can contain. FACS will be used when determining a persons feeling,makeing better computer-animated faces more expressive,and help modify a teaching lesson according to the student liking.",3,7,0.8903896808624268
0f2a7d9,"Do you think this would be a good idea? In the reading Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto, Mona Lisa is mostly happy a little disgusted and a little fearful and a little angry this is about mixed emotions and coming up with a new technology about reading yoiur emotions and calculating them for you to see whos really happy or faking happiness. This is about calculating emotions on a three D computer.

First off, Mona Lisa is mostly always happy and she wanted to come up with a way to see if a lot of school students are happy or just faking there happiniss and hiding there real emotions. there is this three D computer that can take calculations on your emotions and tell you if you are truly happy or hiding your real emotions.

secendly, theres ba computer that contructs a three-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles in the model must move around like the human muscles. there are six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness the three-D computer can detect all six of these emotions and calculate the emotions and tell you how you really feel. you can tell when someone is truly smiling because there muscles in there face move a serten way and if it is a fake smile your muscles move a different way therefore you can tell if the smile is fake or not.

Therefore, yes i think this new technology would work because the three-D model can detect the true feelings you have and calculate it i think you shoukd try this if you ever get a chance.",2,7,0.8091553449630737
0f50ec4,"I think it is very capable of being used in a classroom or elsewhere to use. In paragraph 3, it states that the technology scans 44 muscles in our face precisely, to determine how they have moved to show emotion. If a prinipal was talking to two students in his/her office who were in conflict, the prinicpal could hear both sides of the story, and then use that technology to scan the students' faces to see how they were feeling. If one felt 83% angry, and the other only felt 36% angry, he could talk to the kid that was more angry to try to get him to calm down. If he thought one of the kids was only pretending to be happy, he could scan their face as well and determine what emotions they were actually feeling.

In paragraph 7, the author explains how the technology can pin-point the facial muscle movement in order to precisely tell how the person is feeling. If a person was faking a smile, the scanner would detect that, because it says that when a person is not genuinely happy, their ""smile"" goes more sideways, and their cheeks don't move up. When a person is showing a real smile, their cheeks go up and their eyes squint, like crows feet.

So if a student and another student were in a principals office over a fight, instead of the principal asking them ""How are you guys feeling?"", he could just simply scan their faces' 44 muscles and let the software determine how they were feeling.

I like the idea of the facial scanning technology, but realistically, we probably won't have this in our schools anytime soon. It would cost too much and it isn't really a need. It is a helpful tool, but teachers and administrators don't need it when dealing with students.    ",4,7,0.8151883482933044
0f5c12f,"One thing that robots have never been able to do is having emotions. The Facial Action Coding System can provide a new opportunity for emotions to be incorparated into technology. The software allows for computers to read emotions on human's faces and interpret that data. In a classroom, this software can be extremely valuable to educators.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom can prove to be an extremely powerful tool to educators, as long as it is used in moderation. An educator could use the tool during a lesson to make sure students are engaged, and if a student is bored, the teacher could adjust the lesson plan for that student. The teacher would also know when to help students if the machine is reading them as confused. However, the technology should not replace a teacher in the classroom, as Dr. Huang Suggest, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto). The software can read the emotions, but it can't provide it's own emotions or give the same one-on-one connection a teacher can to help a student. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should not be used as a teacher, but by a teacher, so as to help every student get the most out of their education.

While this new technology can be a fantastic tool, if not used properly, it could have a terriblle outcome. The machine can read a face and give percents of emotions someone is feeling, as shown in the first paragraph, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto). However, if humans start using this software constantly, it might begin to replace our own emotion reading skills. However, the ability of the software to detect certain muscle movements associated with faking a smile and other complex emotions, can prove extremely useful in a school. Educators can usually read emotions pretty well, but when a face shows mixed emotions and a student is trying to hide some of them, this system could help a teacher understand what's going through a student's head.

The Facial Action Coding System is a huge leap in computer and human interaction. Used carefully, this software can allow for teachers to be even more engaged in their students and know how each person is doing with a lesson. This technology is very valuable to the classroom and should be implemented to benefit student's education and to further our knowledge of emotions.      ",4,7,0.7853422164916992

If someone has an IEP the robot could tell the teacher that the student needs more help on this on subject. The robot could possible help the student understand it.

Dr. Huang, the prof. of the Beakman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, have created a way for us to figure people emotion. He created the Facial Action Coding System. Facial Action Coding System is a system that make you understand a person emotion by the muscles in

their face. The use of this technology to read emotion is valuable for many reason.The reason are that it will make us understand how our friends are feeling, to make sure the politician or celebrity is being truthful, and it help us with our

everyday life.

The first reason is that the Facial Action Coding Stystem will help us understand how our friends feel. According to paragraph 5, and line 2, it stated that "" you can probable tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" There always that friend that doesn't express herself well. If she need help with her life or when she is sad she won't understand how to express these emotion to her friends. This will help the people to understand how they feel and know when they need a shoulder to lean on.

Futhermore, the technology will help the citizen identify whether the politician or the president is being truthful. Paragraph 8, line 4-6, it explain, "" these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful."" If we don't have this type of way to figure out if our politician are worth it, then the world would be a mess. We would never know if that person is very truthful in his or her job. Also it a good way to find that good president that will guide us with real emotion and not a fake one.

The last reason is that the tecnology will help us with our everyday life. According to

the last paragraph, it stated that "" moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.(""Putting on a

happy face"" actually work!)"" When we have work or when

go out it always important to have a happy face. When you look mad and depressed, other people around you will know and they will judge you. Having a happy face will make the other think highly of you. You will be able to get along with your co-worker very well. It to make your life easier and better.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System is valuabe because it allow you to understand your peers emotion, when a politician is being truthful, and help you make many friend. Some may argue that it personal and it not our buisness to know how a person feel. In order to make our world better, everyone should understand each other emotion for it to be easier to communicate.

Joy, sadness, anger, doesn't matter, it's a part of everyday life. Facial Action Coding System, a software made by Professor Thomas Huang, is allowing us to read peoples emotions, based simply on their faces. As cool as it is, there are some real life applications that can be used with this. Whether it is for fun, or for research, FACS can change the way see emotions.

FACS can be used for fun, research, or both at the same time. In the article, to test FACS, they scanned the Mona Lisa and came up with the result saying she is, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This is when FACS could be used for fun. Imagine going to museums with the worlds most famous painters paintings, and scanning their faces. You could see what the artist wanted them to have their person feel like. Also, you could use it on animals to see if your dog or cat really is excited or faking it. It doesn't have to be used soley for research, but can have a joking or fun aspect with it.

Now, it comes down to research. Within the article, they explain its possibilities in classrooms to see if students are bored or losing interest. This can be used in classrooms to change the way the person is being taught if they are starting to lose interest because it can change the lesson to make it more interactive. If a person looks frustrated or stressed over a a lesson, the computer could find another way to explain the subject. Or even if the person is excited, then it could make it more challenging to push them to do better. Possibly, on the more controversial side, you could use this to detect malicious intent. If someone consistently seems upset and angry, it could warn the school or the persons counselor to have them talk to them about any issues they're having. This could prevent possible future issues. Lastly, they could use the information collected to make flexible lesson plans for entire schools or classes. There would be little to no downsides to having FACS in classrooms.

Lastly, FACS can be used for both fun and research. Similar to the first paragraph, one could scan their animals face to see if it is excited, sad, or angry. Not only could it be used for fun by scanning your pets faces, but it could be used for research to detect animal patterns or if an animal is sick. All that could help prevent or detect future problems in our pets.

In conclusion, FACS is a software that lets one determine someones emotions based on the look of their face. It can be used for research, fun, or both at the same time. FACS could be put into classrooms to help make better learning plans, used to detect patterns between animals emotion for the well being, or just used to tell if your dog or cat is excited to see you.

0fe6e52,"Have you ever been so confused when it comes to reading and understanding a person that you just ultimately cannot? A new technology system has been released to give exact percentages of a persons emotions just by looking into a camera. The Facial Action Coding System was designed to decode by using ""some new computer software that can recognize human emotions"" (1). The test subject, the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da VInci, has answered many questions when it comes to what she is expressing. The FACS can be valuable in classrooms because it can help with the studies of human anatomy or psychology, and it can help others understand each other.

Calculating another persons emotions can help with understanding human anatomy and psychology classes at schools. For this software, human anatomy has a major role and ""stores similar anatomical informtaion as electronic code"" (5). The research going along with this system shows there are ""action units"" within facial structure that signifies the movement of one or more muscles. Each of the six basic emotions that Dr. Paul Eckman has classified are all associated with the facial muscles. It is important for students to know these muscles and learn how they work. According to Eckman, ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises eyebrows when you're surprised"" and the ""orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"" (3). This up-to-speed technology comes up with information that no human could, but helps students become knowledgable of how it works. Society is based on technology as of right now, and is the forefront of the younger generations, so this software should partake in a students learning.

Emotions are something that are unbelievably hard to understand when coming from other people. One typically cannot tell how a person is feeling just by the way they are looking, unless they are close with them personally. Being able to understand someone's emotions will benefit them and their surroundings, as they can get help if they are down or can have reassurance if they think someone is mad at them. Students can become more aware of each other and can give more support to their peers. With a program like this, the most accurate percentages are provided, giving a description of how the person feels. In the Mona Lisa for example, she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (1). What other technology can get those numbers? The more understandment of each other that is within society is valuable and can potentially create peace amongst us all. The reason the world is in such a bad place is because there is that confusion within each other and nobody knows how anyone truly feels. If students can grasp this concept, this entire generation can change the hatred and all come together.

As the years go by, society is becoming more and more aware of technology, making it have a greater effect on the population as a whole. In schools, technology is the greatest way of teaching and learning because curriculums can be made simpler. Technology is all that will be there eventually, so we might as well use and understand it now. The FACS can answer many questions about a person or group and how they live. The constant wonder and confusion in the world of how people feel about each other can come to an end and create peace. This can only begin with the young generations.

1013fcd,"The Facial Action Coding System is an unnecesscary piece of equipment. The software that would be able to detect the emotions of an individual would have several negative affects on society. The reading of emotions is a useful tool when it is detected by someone's natural instinct, but it would not be helpful to only have an understanding on someone's emotions due to the results given on a screen. The Facial Action Coding System is not a valuable to students because it would decrease the rate at which students learn, identifying someone's emotions will not change how they are feeling, and it would decrease their motivation for work in the future.

The ability for this device to detect the emotions of a student while they are working would be detrimental to the health and responsibilty of the student. The author states that the machines will ""recognize when the student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective intructor"" (D'Alto 6). This would be harmful to the students determination to learn. It would also cause several students to fall behind in their education. Every student experiences boredom in class, but the teacher is unable to change the lesson everytime to best fit one individual student because the other children will fall behind. Students are still capable of learning material when they are bored even if it is not as effectively as when they are interested. Students need to also learn how to work through their emotions to better their ability to improve. When these students get into the work field, they can not call in sick or slack off every time they experience a negative emotion. This device would be teaching children that they should only be productive if they are intrigued by their task. This would not be a proper lesson to teach growing individiuals.

The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels. Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.

The technology that recognizes emotions in order to change the student potential will decrease their motivation. The skill to be compable of working through tough situations is essential to posess. Modifying a students' workload would harm their motivation. These students will no longer be motivation to be their most effective because they will expect everything in life to be modified to their liking. Unfortunately, this is not a trait that can be successfully transferred to real world issues. Therefore, these students will be less prepared for potential problems they may encounter. This system would also decrease the dependence on human connection. The text states that computers need to understand emotional communications because ""most human connection is nonverbal"" (D'Alto 6). Although that statement is true, there is little use for computers undertsanding how humans feel if they can not help the individual with their emotons. This may cause people to reply more on the machines, which would lessen the amount of human connection that exists--much like previous technology advances have done. Human connection is essential to a striving population, therefore it will have negative affect on society.

The Facial Action Coding Sytem would be wasteful to the society, and would cause several negative effects. It is not something worth investing in because it would harm the developing youth. Not only do these machines prove useless to emotions of people, but it will also decrease the motivation of students and future employees.",6,7,0.8777375221252441

Another reason would be that the face scanner wouldnt mess up because it gets all of your face bones. Their is a doctor who studies all the basic emotions what are called happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear and sadness and the doctor who descovered these are Dr. Paul Eckman and they all had charcterastics movements such as your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow when your suprised. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. We always perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look of their face. Meanwhile muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows feet around your eyes. According to the faial feedback Theory of Emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Some of this may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!

The way someone stands, moves, or sets their face can tell others more of what they feel then what they are told; however, these social cues aren't always understood. Technology is impacting the world greatly and the Facial Action Coding Software may seem like just another gadget, but it could change the way of teaching to specialize for individuals. Though the thought of computers identifying all emotions is slightly unsettling there are many benefits that may clome along with the software.

In schools, there are many students who struggle with the cirriculum because they do not understand the way it is being taught. From the teacher's point of view, it may look like they are not engaged because the aren't interested in learning the material. It may actually be because they are not understanding the material. A face that looks bored is usually a straight mouth and dull eyes, a confused face could look similar but with furrowed brows. There may not be a noticable difference between a bored face and a confused face that a teaher can spot especially while looking at many faces at a time.

According to the article, the software detects facial movements and compares them to a nutral face to calculate the percent of an emotion someone is feeling. Having this software in classroom computers could benefit both the students and the teachers in many ways. Along with modifying the lesson, the computers could collect data of how a student was reacting during an assignment or during a lecture and then notify the teacher or professor about the results. If many of the students are confused by what is being taught, the teacher could re-word the lectures in a way that might be more clear. If the students are becoming quickly bored of the material then the teacher may need to make some assgnment a little more challenging. The software can also show the teacher when students get exited about certain topics or when they are frightened by an assignment. When assignments are turned in and the result is bad grades, many teachers may assume that the student isn't trying their best, but there may be many other reasons why the work wasn't what was expected. With the facial action software, the teachers would be able to understand why the student didn't do the work properly. If they were confused then the teacher could suggest way to understand better, if the student was bored and didn't try, the teacher may talk about the importance of grades.

Even if this software isn't able to be avalible in schools, learning about facial actions and cues can benefit everyone. The article give instructions to make a happy face by highlighting points that are present in a naturally happy face. Learning instructions to making the faces of many emotions can be a helpful tool in classrooms and in many other environment when communication is needed. Emotions are a very personal thing and it should be the person's choice whether to show their emotions or not; however, this technology in class rooms may improve the teavhing style so that there aren't as many kids struggling to pass their classes.

1042884,"Have you ever thought of reading expressions but by the use of technology.? Today scientist have created a system that helps read expressions. It reads six basic emotions and many others like happiness, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. Do you think is should be used for classrooms?

Mona Lisa is an example of the use of the Facial Action Coding System. They detected that she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Also, this system is the use to recognize emotions that was invented by Prof. Thomas Huang. The process

of this is when the computer conduct a 3-D model face. The Facial Action Coding System recognize the emotions of Mona Lisa. Computers chould do the same. As a matter of fact, a computer should know how you are feeling towards the ads and webs. In the article, Dr. Huang states that

""A computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then is could modify the lession, like an effective human instructor"". However, this system could also be used to make computer animations faces ""more expressive"". Lastly, this system could be useful for schools because it will know how students will feel towards the lessons.

In conlusion, the Facial Action Coding System should be used for classrooms. To begin with, It shows that Mona Lisa was a great example or the use of this system. It detected of how she was feeling. So when a computer detects a students face of a ad, it will know what he/she don't like. In fact, just by using our minds will be difficult to describe an emotion but by the use of this would be a great help. ",3,7,0.910300612449646

The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The use of the new technology to read students expression should be used because it can help communicate, it can help identify certain things, and it can help teachers.

The new facial techonolgy could help with communcation in classroms. In paragrapgh 6 it states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang."" ""So computers need to understand that, too"". This shows how this new technology helps communication between other humans be more understanding. Also, knowing what someone is really feeling when a conversation is being held in a classroom. Instead of students hiding their emotions teachers will really know how kids are feeling.

FACS, the Facial Ation Coding System is improving other techonolgy. According to paragrapgh 8 it says that to an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. This reveals how identyify humans emotions could be accurate even when they face may look like something else. Also, being in a classroom it would help determine if a student is lying by a guilty look students may try and hide. This technology could help the classroom in many other situations.

The FACS could help out teacher in various situations in class. In paragraph 6 it cites that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. This shows how the coding system could help teachers spot out the right students who needs help. In some situation where teachers may ask students do everyone understand something and someone is not brave enough to speak up and say no and move one without knowing what to do this could help teachers know wether students truly understand or maybe not on task. The new technology, the Facial Action Coding System gives teachers relieable and accurate information about students which will help out teachers tremendously.

The use of the new electronic device used to read students expression should be used because it can help communicate, it can help identify certain things, and it can help teachers. Using the Facial Action Coding System in class to determine emotional expression of students is valuable.The techonology provide helpful use according to Dr. Huang. ",4,7,0.8823061585426331
10dbcec,"The use of this technology that allows people and teachers to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. This new technology can be used to detect whether a student understands the lesson or is confused on a subject. Professor Thomas Huang has developed a new way to use technology that can recognize how each person is feeling, based on their facial and emotional expressions.

Artist, Leonardo da Vinci, studied human anatomy all his life and used this study to create paintings that can percieve a certain facial expression to convey certain emotions. Leonardo da Vinci's painting, Mona Lisa, was used by the technology Dr. Haung created to determine what exactly she was expressing. In the painting, she seems to be, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This was all shown by using the technology many people are trying to get into the classroom to help students and teachers better understand each other. The software broke down each expression she has on her face to figure out how da Vinci wanted her to feel and show through facial emotions.

In classrooms, teachers can often tell whether or not a student understands the materials based on there emotions the student gives out in the classroom. Dr. Haung has researched over this concept and has made this software that allows, ""A classroom computer [that] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would allow teachers or college professors to better teach students that do not understand the materials, like some students would. The computer's software could also allow teachers to understand if the students are benefitting from the lesson or if they understand the topic being taught to them.

There are many different facial muscles that can show a certain emotion based on how you are feeling. The ""frontalis pars lateralis"", which is found above your eye, will raise your eyebrows when you are feeling surpised. The ""orbicularis oris"", which is found all around the mouth, will tighten your lips to show that you have been angered by someone or something. Dr. Haung has been working with Dr. Paul Eckman and his FACS machine (Facial Action Coding System) to better understand what and how facial expressions can be found. The FACS machine is something that can classify six of the major emotions that can be found on your face like,"" happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" These muscle based emotions and the use of the FACS machine can let the teachers in the classroom know, if a certain student is struggling or if one student is excelling in the topic or class in general.

Facial muscles, emotions, and new discoveries with technology are all ways to determine if a student is having trouble in the classroom. It is a beneficial way to read emotion expressions of these students and is considered a very valuable discovery of technology. New emotions can be made clear by expression or using the FACS machine.

10fda69,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" D'Alto describes a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. One of the creator of this software Dr. Huang said his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code ( paragraph 5). Going on, it knows your feelings by the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bone) that lifts the corners of your mouth. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because this new modern software can tell you how your peers are feeling.

Furthermore, imagine being able to detect exactly how your friends are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotion. Pretty awesome! For example, "" They even indicate the difference between a geniune smile and a forced one"" (paragraph 7). This shows that the software can even tell the difference between a fake and a real one. So, that means if your friends are feeling down you can just notice by trying that new software. Another example, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in a painted face.""( paragraph 4). This example shows that a software can identify mixed emotions. Also, we humans perform this same calculation everyday, but in a different way. Thus, faces don't lie: those mucles ( zygomatic major and risorius) clues are sometimes used to stop when a smile is fake or real. Therefore, this software can help you know what your peers are feeling and each facial traits that conveys happy.

Going on, this software is very modern. For example, ""All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" ( paragraph 3). This shows that the creators are trying to make the software scan a person's facial as close as possible. Another example, "" happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness""( paragraph 3). This shows that the software can alnost detect every feelings. Which is a great news. Thus, if you tighten your lips it shows anger and that's how the computer knows your angry. Pretty smart!

In conclusion, using this technology to read the emtional expreessions of students in a classroom is valuable. It can perform precisely specific emotions of your peers by simply scanning their faces. Thus, mention in paragraph 6, it can also pick what ads or video games to show by judging your face to make sure you are happy.

express their feelings.",3,7,0.8881485462188721

11c2627,"The article ""Marking Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D' Alto is a good article talking about how the system called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I believe this system is great for a student in a classroom. The system will help a teacher by telling weather or not a kid likes something. Another way the system is valuable is because the system can tell if a person like an ad on the computer or not. The system will read your facial expressions to tell weather you are happy, surprised, angry, disgusted, scared, or sad.

The first way the Facial Action Coding System is helpful is by telling the

teacher weather or not a kid likes something. Each facial expression is different from every person. For example, if a kid is reading a book on the computer. The computer will read the kid facial expressiones to tell the teacher weather he or she likes the book or not. The computer will send different percentages to the teacher on how the kid feels about the book. If the student does not like the book, the teacher could help the student by giving he or she another book to read. This system can also be helpful for companys that play videos. When someone watches a video and an ad comes on, the system can tell weather or not they like the ad or the person dislike the ad. If the person disliked the ad, the company that plays the videos and ads can play a different ad that the person may like more. I do believe this system will be valuable for the human world. The system will give percentage on how the person feel about something. The system will tell weather he or she shows happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, or sadness.

Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has a awesome idea of a system that read people facial expressions. This system will be valuable in the world. It can help in the classroom of school or outside of school. The Facial Action Coding System will tell if a

person is happy, angry, scared, sad, surprised, or disgusted. Every person has a different facial expressions. This sytem will help tell if they are what their facial expressions say they are.    ",4,7,0.8501150608062744

I think that the Facial Action Coding System isn't a value because all technology is NOT 100% correct. There ould be a time when the computer glitches and mess up. Its not just a computer that glitches, its all electronics. Such as phones,tablets,video games and any other electronics you can think of. The FACS has no use because you can tell when a person is sad or mad or even angry.

Even if a person dont show facial expressions on how they feel they will feel that way deep inside. For example, students could be happy coming to school talking to their friends,just be in happy mood but when they get home they are depress and they start to act different. As days go on this student is changing as a person and people start to notice when you change. Everbody has different facial expressions each day if a person is not feeling that day they will show it. You can't use a computer just to show how people feel. The computer can tell people that your happy just because you smile all day but really your mad,sad,and depressesd but no one will ever know because of the way that the technology is set up. i still feel like the FACS shouldnt have never been created.

i still feel that way because,like the text stated ""you can probably tell how a friend is looking simply by the look on their face."" you can also tell when you hang around a certain person everyday and they start to change and their facial expression start to change, their body language will also start to change. Just because you smile alot dont mean your happy .When you smile you muscles in your smile starts to change but that don't mean your happy your still sad. if your were to get tested on the machine they would considered you happy just because you smile alot but really you just depressed .

i know all of this imformation because when im at school i get serious and focus on my school work. During lunch i laugh and play with my friends and giggle all the time but when im at home its a different story. By me being the middle child i get treated differently so i always look angry when im at home . 95% of the time i try to keep a smile on my face but the other 5% i try to stay away from, because i dont want to be angry all the time i wanna be happy and make other people happy too. if i was to get tested the computer would say 100% happy.

No one should use the FACS if they know how they feel. Everybody know what wrong with them and what their issue is. You shouldn't need a machine to tell you something you already know. I know im not the only one that feel this way but everybody has their own opinion. This concludes on why i feel like the FACS should of NEVER been created.",3,7,0.8399595618247986

Most human communication is nonverbal so computers need to understand that to so this system would be perfect for a classroom envirment.

Being a student I know that if you don't enjoy or understand what your learning about then you won't understand it that's why the Facial Action Coding System needs to be put into classrooms. Plus it would help the teacher out a lot teachers are smart but the internet is smartter, endless, and full of knowledge. As humans we perform the same ""calculation"" every day for example we know when our friend is happy, sad, or mad just by looking at their face. Their are some facial trait that we would have trouble finding like worried but with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) we wouldn't have to look for it the computer can find it and caculat a new problem for the student.

Did you know that when you smile the people around you tend to smile? According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your face muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. So if you smile your body will make happy thoughts if you frown your body will make sad thoughts. Facial expressions for each emotion are universal even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression so even tho humans can ""calcuat"" what emotion other people use we truly don't know how they feel or what they are thinking. This is why I belive that a Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in a classroom envirment.",3,7,0.8566796779632568
126187d,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technoloy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The new software has been developed that imroves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The software is the lastest innovation from the Prof. Thomas Huang of illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam.

Dr. Huanga and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans. In the fact these humans can perform this same impressive ""calcutation"" every day. LIke you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. The Mona Lisa can really really bring back a smile to her face.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huamg predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Those were some of Dr. huang predicts. The computer can write some simple instructions that can make Mona Lisa smile with different emotions.

While looking in the mirror:

* Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth.

* Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the coners of your eyes

* Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes.

In the fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My conclusion, this new technology that Dr. Huamg is pretty amazing. This system or computer is a good thing it can make people smile and it can make Mona Lisa smile. It can also make the students smile or they can know what emotionl.  ",1,7,0.8407931327819824
126c1a9,"In this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author talks about Facial Action Coding System, this enables computers to identify human emotion. This would be very valuable in the classroom because it can help us understand if a kid is confused and needs help or if they are doing good. It can also identify mixed emotions. This article says that showing emotion is good for you and this would enable kids to show more emotion. Having these technologies in the classroom would be valuable.

""A cumputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr Huand predicts."" If they had the Facial Action Coding System it would help the teacher to know if he had to change his way of teaching or slow down and go back if students are confused. This could help them as teachers to help their students really understand what they are learning and make it stick. Not all people learn the same and having this kind of technology could help us figure out better in which way we learn.

The Facial Action Coding System can even show mixed emotions, so it can get the best identification of our feelings. ""By weighting the different ubits, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This could help our computer to but the adds up that apply to our mood. Such as if we are sad put something that makes minds think of happines. Or if we are anrgy put something up there that makes us laugh. This technology can really help us change our bad moods into good moods everyday.

Showing emotions like putting on a happy face can actually work according to this article. The article says ""Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotion, but also may even help produce them."" If we put these in our classrooms it will help kids want to show good emotion. This would overall help the mood of the classroom feel a lot happier. If kids feel more happier in the classroom the more they are going to want to work hard.

Having these in classrooms sounds like an amazing idea! The world is becoming more and more reliant on technology, the more we show our kids technology and teach them how to use it the better they are in the future. If we get our kids to show their emotions more and get computers that help to changes their emotions to better ones would only help. This system is so smart that it can even read mixed emotions. These things can helpt teachers truly understand how to teach in a way that is positive fore their students and the way that they best learn. The Facial Action Coding System is a truly wonderful thing and we should have them in the classroom.",4,7,0.905098021030426

13554fc,"There is now a new technological software called the Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions. I personally believe that the use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. There are many details in the passage that support my argument.

In paragrapgh 6 of the article, it proclaims, "" "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" ""Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" In the real world today, students often begin to get bored during, or simply just very confused on the material they are working on. When students begin to get confused or bored, their engagement in learning declines. To have a technology software that could modify the lesson like a human instructor when students are confused, or bored is very valuable.

The text also states, "" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" When teachers are finished teaching material, they often ask if anyone has any questions. Some students will lie and say they understand the material when they really don't, because they are too embarassed to be critisized if they don't know how to do a certain problem. With this new form of technology, teachers could actually see if everyone is grasping the imformation they are learning,and not just sayig they are when they are not. This is a major advandcemnt in leaing for all students.

There are many reasons as to why the use of the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions, for stuents in the classrooms is valuable. Students often always have negative attitudes or emotions that affect their productive learning. Having this technological system will help teachers understand how students are feeling, and will better approach students. When teachers correctly know how to approach certain students, the students learning will prosper.              ",3,7,0.8472400903701782
13724f7,"I think the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions would be a good idea because ""imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" You would be able to tell if the are mad, happy, or upset just by using the Facial Action Coding System. With this new technology you will always be able to tell how a person feels instead of assuming or them lying about it. Instead it's just one scan and there now u know their emotions.

For example people have always wondered what Mona Lisas emotions were in her painting but according to computer soft wear she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" With the Facial Action ACcording System you will always be able to tell by a person feels. Now the technology is able to calculate how you feel yes ""calculate"" emotions-like math."" Just by using a computer of a 3-D model face it is able to move 44 major muscles similar to human muscles. According to Eckman each person has about six basic emotion happiness, surpised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Dr. Huang says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". Another thing Dr. Huang said is ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" in the painting of Mona Lisa the software was able to identify the mixed emotions. Do you know how you can just look at a friend and know how they are feeling? Well that's basically how the Facial Action Coding System works it is able to tell a person emotion just by scaning their face.

It's a little strange to know that a computer is able to tell your emotions when your happy, mad, or upset. According to Dr. Huang the Facial Action Coding System could be a good thing because "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Also that ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" With this new technology I think it could be very usefull and helpfull for teachers and other jobs as well.

This software has classified six basic emotions-happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Having stated this, this software can inform teachers on how their students are feeling. In paragraph 6 of the article, it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If teachers know exactly how their students are feeling, they can provide better aid. This is only possible if the Facial Action Coding System is implemented in schools.

Although, we can probably tell how a student is feeling simply by the look on their face, it is not as effective as using this software. Teachers do no have the time to be guessing how their students are feeling. It would waste too much time. If this technology would be implemented in schools, teachers would be able to help more students in a more efficient mannner.

The implementation of this technology in schools would be amazing, hands down. Not adopting this technology would be an ignorant choice. Knowing what students are struggling in would be made easy. Also, teachers would be able to provide aid to more students than before. Its benefits outweigh any negatives that might be present.              ",3,7,0.8845624923706055
13dea5a,"The Value of Emotions

""Many teachers cannot tell when a student has something emotionally wrong with them,"" my mom, OTHER_PII, stated. My mom is friends with many teachers and talks to them about their students and how they can tell when something is wrong with a student. In today's society many teachers throughout school corporations struggle with knowing if their is something wrong with their students. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is valuable in the classroom because it can help the teachers understand the students, help know when a student is emotionally not stable, and help the students not get too bored or confused during a lesson.

The FACS is valuable in the classroom for many reasons, including the fact that it will help the teacher understand their students. From a student point of view, many teachers do not understand their students fully when something is wrong. While many kids come to school and look fine, there may be more going on in their home life than a teacher knows about. If the Facial Action Coding System was in place in schools, teachers would be able to find out what emotion the students are feeling and see if they can help them in any way. In Paragraph 4, Dr. Huang states, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" This explains how the computer will recognize any emotion that the student may have, even if it is not the same as everyone else. The computer system can read your emotions and come up with different advertisements on the screen to make a person happier which would also benefit many people. In paragraph 6, the author states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" These computers can read your emotions and change the content on your screen just based on how you reacted to it. The FACS would be valuable in schools because it would help the student be happier while in school and help the teacher recognize what is going on with the student and understand them more.

The Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the schools because it can help the teacher know when a student is not emotionally stable. Many teachers do not realize when their is something wrong with a student and the FACS could help with that. Thousands of students throughout all the schools in America have issues at home and show that at school with how much work they do not participate in and how they treat others at school. There is an underlying issue within the school system because many teachers are not able to recognize when these students have problems and issues like this could lead to more school violence acts. In paragraph 4, the author says, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements--in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" The FACS can track any emotion in any person which can be helpful in school because there are many different kids throughout the schools that have different emotions. The computer system can recognize these emotions with the facial movements of a student. In Paragraph 3, D'alto states, "" Eckamn has classified six basic emotions--happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness--and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" Depending on what emotions the students have and how they convey that with facial muslces, the computer can read this and help the student get on the right track and fix that emotion if it is a negative emotion.

The Facial Action Coding System can help recognize if the students are bcoming confused or bored. Many student get distracted, confused, or bored when they are working in class. In Paragraph 6, Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would help the student and teacher because when a student gets bored they automatically stop paying attention and do their own thing, but with the FACS the computer could help them not be confused or catch their attention so they are not bored. In Paragraph 6, the author states, ""It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The computer system could act as a teacher and help the students if maybe the teacher is busy which would be an advantage to both the teacher and the student. While many people think this would not be valuable because it has no place in the school and would not help anyone, the Facial Action Coding System would not only help many students, but many teachers as well, while not being too invasive.

The Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in schools because it could help the teachers understand their students, it could also help the teacher know when a student is not emotionally stable, and it could help the student with not getting too bored or confused with a lesson. This would be very valuable in schools because of the daily emotions students go through in a school day!                                                             ",4,7,0.8203526139259338
14174ed,"Facial recognition, a thing of the future, at least that's what people thought. With the new age of innovative technology, a special field of new technology has come to the public, facial recognition software. One of the most prominent softwares in the facial recognition field is the FACS, or facial action coding system, which is what was used to figure out exactly what emotion Mona Lisa was feeling in her painting. However, this software could be used in many other fields. The ability to read and detect what emotion some are feeling is very powerful and could be implimented into certain areas such as the classroom. The usage of FACS could be very beneficial to schools for reading students emtions so teachers could see how their learning plan affects the students, organize and figure out which subjects students may enjoy more, and also allow schools to see what areas of the school may need to be improved on the most.

By using facial recognition, teachers would be ablel to read the expressions on students' faces and see what their learning plan make the students feel. A prime example of how this could be used in the classroom would be in paragraph four, where the author states "" 'The facial expressions for each emotion are are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements."" This specific example is important because by using this software, the facial movements of every student could be tracked, without worry of missing something, and could therefore help teachers distinguish how all their students feel about their lesson plan. Along with that, in paragraph six the author states something similar to this main point ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is exactly what the point is, the computer could tell what needed to be changed and why.

Along with seeing how the teacher's plan affects the students, FACS could also potentially allow students to be organized and grouped up by what subject they appear to enjoy the most. Computers and computer programs are used most often for the usage and organiztion of data, that is what defines computer code, sets of data being used in certain ways. Well, the same type of usage could be had in a classrooom for organizing which subject students liked more. In paragraph five the author writes ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specfic emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical informatino as electronic code."" This points out that code already stores the data that it takes in and knows how to use it. That takes out a step in the process of using it in the class. By having it store data, the computer could then organize it into sections based on what students appeared more happy in certain classes and help with finding interests. Also, in paraghraph four the author states ""By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This is especially important due to the fact that sometimes students can feel mixed about the class they are in, which means the computer can help figure out how they may feel truly about the subject.

Above the learning aspect, schools could see where students physically feel the best or worst in the school or class. While the majority of use would be for the learning portion of the class, FACS could also be used quite often to help discern what physical things may need to change in the school. Maybe a student in a poor chair shows discomfort and the school learns it needs better chairs. In paragraph five, the author writes ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" While this is true, many people are able to easily figure out what a face may mean, the computer would have an even easier time doing it with lighting quick judgement and fast calculations to back it up. The usage of these quick calculations could be beneficial and allow the school to have a better input system and see exactly how the school feels, rather than relying on teahcers to figure out how the students may feel. Another good example of how the FACS could help improve school's physical aspects would be in paragraph six where the author uses and example of improvement themself by stating ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This example shows very well how the computer recognition could really tend to one's needs and how one feels, therefore helping improve the quality of the school.

Overall, facial recognition software is a very promising and prominent idea for the future of classrooms. The computer's ability to see how the learning plan affects the students and change the plan based on the response to the FACS being able to organize and find which subject the students like more in their school is extremely crucial to the new innovative learning process. Also by helping improve the overall quality of the school, the software is something that certain schools should look into. Hopefully this idea of facial recognition software in schools can become a reality and eventually become a nationally recognized function to aid in the learning process. Once an idea of the future brought into the modern day, the Facial Action Coding System truly has an eye for all things emotion.",6,7,0.8772561550140381
141df49,"This technology that can read students' emotional expression is good. Because it can read student's behavior.

For example if there's a man in your back and he's trying to hurt you,you can act quickly because the technology will tell you and you can run away from that man.

142c979,"Reading this article on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" there would have to be an agreement on technology to read the emotional expressions of students. Well technology to begin with now adays is so advanced almost anything is possible. The reasoning behind how computers can read peoples emotions is proven by The Facial Action Coding System.

The sensors in a computer can decode how you are feeling just by the movement in a persons face called the ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, has already classified the six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is based off the movement of our facial muscles. There are different muscles in your face that help our cheeks, eyes, mouth and forehead to move different ways when we make different facial expressions. When we are angry, we squint our forehead together and our mouth tightens. When we are happy, the eyes squint and rise, along with our cheeks and mouth. it opens wide and the corners of our mouth also rise. along with our other emotions, FACS detects the movement of these muscles and determines whether we are happy or just faking it. Even by the slightest different movement, when a smile is on your face but isnt't real. Everyday, its seen on someones face normally their true emotion. If a person is smiling but not a big, and you are surrounded by this person, you may be able to tell if it's real or not. FACS proved that it van detect emotion through videos, images, or even in a mona lisa painting.

Yes, I agree with the article that was written becuase not only from the evidence that was supported in the article, everyone has put on a face that wasn't real and had been called out on it. Even the expressions a person makes are instinctual. When you get angry, sad, or happy, you make a face unintentionally before you even think about it. A person doesn't put on a front when they stub there toe. That persons face will cringe and they may cry or scream. FACS is accurate and even without it, it's sort of a given how someone is feeling by their facial expressions.",2,7,0.8572116494178772

The software can use muscle detectors to analyze and detect how a person is feeling. From my perspective, I think this is a great software to have, especially for certain situations. Some situations may include popping up media.

One reason why I think this is a great idea is because of it's function where it recognizes what you're feeling, and make modifications based around it, so you'll feel better. In the text, it mentions of how the software can detect whether someone is confused or bored, and can make some modifications to better suit the person. This shows that when it does that, it can help students better understand the topic. In the text, it mentions how when the software detects your emotion, it sends over an ad based on how you feel. This shows that if someone is feeling sad, they can send them an article about how to get better or how to overcome a loss, which is really useful. This is great for using media to assist you, but of course, it has a human-caused benefit.

The software can help you make random faces, and when done, it can help you with your emotions. In the text, it states that making fake smiley faces actually causes you to feel slightly happy. This shows that when you're making a fake smiley face when down, there's a chemical in your body that actually can help you get better. In the text, it states that Stanislavsky has his students make happy faces and frowning faces, due to the previous fact to help them better act. This shows that the software can help you detect whether or not you're actually acting a feeling well or not. Now, there is a benefit for those who don't have a software.

The software can detect facial muscles, and that helps it point out what a person is feeling. In the text, it states that the software succesfully recognized Mona Lisa's facial muscles, and it showed her to be 83% happy. This shows that the software can go through many paintings and easily detect how they're feeling. In the text, it states that with it's muscle-detecting technology, it can detect whether or now a politician or celebrity is being truthful or not. This shows that the software can detect whether or not a celebrity is lying, and that can helpful, especially in an allegation.

Overall, I believe that this technology is good to have around. It can detect how you feel, and attempt to assist you. It can cause you to make fake happy faces and actually feel happy. Finally, it can help out with detecting a truthful person or not. With that said, I believe that this will go great with classrooms in the country. ",4,7,0.7683999538421631

The Facial Action Coding System is the system that was designed by scientists to read emotions. They believe that teachers could use this system for lessons online. Even though it could help teachers, it shouldn't be used in a class. This technology could have many flaws that would produce false readings. Especially when reading kids emotions. This technology does help in many ways, but there are some things that humans have to do by them selves.

Teachers need to stop relying on technology to teach. A teacher should be required to take classes that can help them become a better teacher and to help them with reading emotions. Instead of them using the Facial Action Coding System to find out kids emotions they should take a psychology class. That class will teach them what they need to know about humans. Especially humans going through adolesence. Once those teachers understand how emotions work they wont have to rely on a technology that isn't flawless.

The Facial Action Coding System has so many flaws in it that prevent it from being useful. The article states that this technology can recognize when a student is confused or bored. The problem with that is the fact that a person can fake emotions. If the students wanted to try to be funny they could mess with the system and change something that was working. In the article, Dr. Huang said, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective teacher."" An effective teacher wouldn't change something just because a couple people ar bored or confused. This system also doesn't factor in the chances of someone having a bad day. If someone is having a bad day confused emotions could already be happening before the lesson. This would mess everything up.

I understand that some people aren't natural psychologists, and don't know how to read emotions. These people can just take there time and teach themselves how to read them. Even though not all teachers have the knowledge learned through psychology, they all should. People naturally believe that technology can help. It can help, and thats why it is understandable to want the Facial Action Coding System to be used by school. There are better alternatives to this system. The author stated, ""we can write down simple instructions the ""encode"" different emotions."" If people can do that then, why aren't they doing it?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should not be used in school. It has no value to learning. The better alternative is to make teachers do things themselves. Teachers should learn how to read emotions. They also need to learn that you can't always rely on a system that is not flawless.

14c4255,"How would you feel if their was a computer watching you as do your work? Do you think that would be weird and maybe even uncomfortable? Well, that is what would be happening if their were computers that read your expressions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Dr. Huang and Dr Eckman have developed a system that does so. The use of this technoogly to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

First of all, the article states that ""Eckman has six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger disgust fear and sadness..."". If a computer was to detect any of these emotions from a student while he or she is working there wouldn't be an easy way of knowing whether the student is struggling or if the student is doing just fine. This quote from ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" shows how FACS (the Facial Action Coding System) won't necessarily be valuable to students when they are in their classrooms working.

Secondly, from

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The computers students use at home could be the same as the computers they do there work on during class. By saying this there is a possibility that FACS won't even work for styudents when there at school doing work. The quote used above shows that you cant count on FACS to be available for the use of students in class.

Lastly, from the article ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". If a student had FACS on there computer and they were doing there work in class and they smile because another student did something nice for them, and FACS detected them smiling and then modified their work that could be a bad thing. It could be a bad thing if the student was doing their work and they actually didnt understand what they were doing and now that FACS detected them smiling they are now doing harder work which is a detriment to the student. This quote shows that having FACS on a students computer while they are working in class could be bad.

In conclusion, having the FACS technolgy on a students computer while they are working at school in their classroom is not valuable. The article does not give any examples or ocurrances of the technology to read a students emotions of having any good outcomes. The use of FACS could incorectly detect wether a student is having trouble or not, it only detects basic emotions, and it may not even be available to the use of students depending on the type of computer they use in their classroom.",4,7,0.8220130205154419
14df8e2,"This article is going to change the world toady as we know. If we allow our computers to identify human emotions, its a whole new way to look at life. People will be able to get what the want when they want because their computer will know when they are happy or mad at something. For instance, if you are online shopping and your face seems disgusted by a bright yellow shirt, the computer will see your expression and change the shirt to a blue one. By having that change be done for you, people will instantly become happier and have what they want right in front of them.

In my opinion, this new use of technolgy could be very helpful for many people. In the essay, it states the percent of emotions that the painting of Mona Lisa is. No one could ever be that spot on, so with the Facial Action Coding System, we now have the precise percents of what Mona Lisa's emotions are. By having these percents, we now have a blast to the past to think about what Leonardo da Vinci was thinking while painting this portrait. Maybe the reason she was mostly happy is because he was a genuinely happy person. It opens up a whole new door to what we can study and research. Since no one from back then is still alive today, this is our way of finding out not only what he was doing, but better yet what he was thinking! There is not a single machine that can do that today, so having this device would be a game changer.

Although the Facial Action Coding System would be an amazing new technology to have, many people could disagree with the system. Since having this system means that something, or even someone, is always watching you, people could feel that it is an invasion of personal space. They would alwasy feel like someone is there, even though no one is. It could lead to mental problems, such as thinking you are not alone and that people are watching your every move. Because of this, the system could be a bad call and lead to a bigger failure then they hoped. Today we are already facing problems with hackers hacking into our webcams and recording what we do without knowing it. This system is doing the exact same thing, but without the trouble of hacking. Unfortunately, it is already there with us knowing exactly what it is doing.

Although the Facial Action Coding System could have some problems, the success could be even bigger than the possible failure. Nothing like this has ever been made before, so the reaction to something like this could be endless. All in all, I believe that this new system is one that could change the world for good!",3,7,0.7118988037109375

Humans communicate mostly by thier own faces. We humans have come to know that reading a persons face can tell a lot about them. Having facial recognition in

schools will help the students.

Going to school is a new experience everday. Seeing new people in the halls to trying to figure out a new lesson in class. Each student has their own way of learning. Communicating with peers. With all the same boring lessons everyday, school can become a boring learning enviroment.

Facial recognition would change how students think of thier learning enviroments. In the article Dr. Huang predicts that if FACS is used in a learning enviroment the lessons would be changed by looking at the students facial expressions. The computer could see if the sudents were becoimg bored or confused. The computer then would change the lesson to make the students become more engaged. This would help the students focus more and understand the lesson. Maximizing the lesson to the best of its ablility to help the students.

This technology would help the students feel like the lesson isn't boring. The facial features of every person are different. The classroom is filled with twenty to thirty faces every class. With the new FACS system would help the teachers and students become more active with thier lesson. By reading the faces of the students the FACS changes the lesson. Thus making the lesson more enjoyable for everyone.

In conclusion, having a learning enviroment that functions for youself and with others is the greatest possible outcome. The FACS in the classroom would maximize everyone's lerning ablility. If you get the maximum learning ablity out of a lesson, the lesson shoulnd't have to be retaught. Intern, students are getting the most out of the lesson everyday and not being bored by learning the same lessons.                  ",3,7,0.812506377696991

a computer softaware program called the Facial Action Coding System or FACS which allows computers to identify human emotions is said to be able to help the educational atmoshphere of the classroom. However the use of this software to read the emotional expressions of students is not all that valuable to the classroom.

The use of compters in most schoold is limited at best, and not all schools have access to computers at all, so the use of the FACS program would not impact many students or classrooms. The best way to use the program would simply as a way to sell products to the general public not as a way to make learning more inclusive. A comercial use would best suit this program, and allow it to reach more people for example in the text it states "" if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similair ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"". The use of this program in electronic or online lessons would also be detremental towards the social skills that a classroom is meant to nurture. It would remove the human element that young minds need to grow.

Now one might say that the use of this program in schools would better the learning environment and make the lessons easier fro students to understand.

This is the stance the inventor of this technology believes when he said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""then it coud modify the lesson, like an effective instructor"". However this would be inneffective in classrooms and schools that do not have the resources that are needed for this application. There are also very few schools that actively use electronics inside of the classroom while they have the needed resources.

This technology has other ways that it could be used, that would be of more use in todays society besides in the classroom.

This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it would allow teachers to know when students become confused, are being dishonest, or are depressed and possibly having problems at home.

In the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student.

School behavior is a big part of a students education. If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly. Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment. The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers. In the excerpt, the author writes, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,"" (D'Alto). In this quote, the author tells the reader about some facial muscle clues that allow experts to tell if a famous figure is being dishonest. These are some of the same facial clues the FACS looks for.

Finally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. The machine can detect six different emotions, including sadness. This could prove useful when dealing with distressed students. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto).

Three men have been working on a project called ""The Facial Action Coding System"".

Dr. Paul Eckman (a psyhologist) is the creator of The Facial Action Coding System. The software was made by prof. Thomas Huang (of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science) in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe(of the University of Amsterdam). The FACS was used to be able to read emotions in percentage. It was able to read six emotions hapiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness due to their 44 major strands of muscles on a humans face.

The way that FACS was able to read your emotions are like complicated math equations. The 44 strands each have different meanings each movement of one or more muscles are called ""action unit"". The frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyebrows) raises your eyebrows when your surprised and your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. The use of FACS have been use on the Renaissance Painting Mona Lisa by Leonardo da vinci to show expressions that only that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery.

While some may not understandable the use of this technology, it would be groundbreaking and highly effective within our classrooms. Many humans portray false or pretend emotions to other humans for various, different reasonings. However, the FACS could be used to break through this method of manipulation and deception by tracking the facial muscles being used and moved by its subject. It would allow the computer to calculate the different emotions and feelings being present in its subject, which could be used in a matter of many different ways.

Within the classroom, various emotions can be felt by its students while learning new topics and receiving their education. Feelings can range from excitement and an interest in learning new subjects to being bored or unmotivated to proceed with the lesson. Day by day, technology is further and used more frequently within our schools, allowing us to adapt new education methods. Most students in the US are presented with an electronic device by their school to complete their homework and classwork on. The FACS could easily be intregrated into these devices, affecting how education could be taught and learned. If it was being used in a correct, effective manner, it could change how we teach our students forever!

Let's imagine that a student was perhaps puzzled and confused by a lesson being taught using technology. The FACS program could detect this, modifying the information to be more understandable and/or enjoyable to the student. This would allow for education to be more effective in many different ways. It could be very different for how two tenth graders in the same class learn new subjects and topics the most effectively. If this was released into schools, it is very possible and most likely that grades would improve drastically. This technology could also assist those with special needs or learning disabilities to teach them in the most effective, best technique for them.

While being present at school, not all emotions displayed by students are caused by learning. There might be unknown stresses or difficulties at home or personal lives, causing emotional and/or physical distress. This can majorly affect their grades and learning experience, but also their overall health in general. Using the FACS to detect certain emotions and patterns in students could help notify educators and administration of possible issues with various causes. This would allow the student to gain access to the aid and assist they need to be able to persevere and stride forward with success. The health of students need to come first before learning and using technology to discover if they need assistance would invaluable to the school systems.

Technology is always advancing and evolving into different, new forms. The FACS is just one of the many things that could change our education system and how we teach students. Overall, it would provide aid to students that need it to succeed in their education and have more of a understanding in subjects they were originally confused by.

Although the software could help notify teachers when the students feel confused, this software could also make students feel insecure and violated. The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in the classroom.

Dr. Huang believes that his new software could inhance the classroom setting. It would ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson,"" (paragraph 6). However, it is healthy for students to have human interactions with a teacher. Also, having the initiative to speak up if they do not understand something is part of becoming independent. School prepares kids for life beyond high school by giving them the freedom to speak up and to make their own decisions. Placing a Facial Action Coding System in the class would not help solve the need for students to learn how to live independently.

In paragraph two Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" I strongly disagree with this statement. Being able to express ourselves and being able to interpret things in different ways, is in our human nature. If we, as a race, should expect to rely on a computer to detect our emotions, humans would become robotic. The beauty of human nature is being able to see through peoples' emotions and forming different connections. Taking away any room for interpretating peoples' feelings would also take away the mystery and joy in life.

Just as nobody can read thoughts, our feelings should also be kept private. By adding a computer system that detects emotions in every classroom, students would not have the privacy they deserve. They would never learn how to live independently and this system would not prepare the students for life beyond school. Finally, the need for human interaction is constant. Humans need to be able to communicate face-to-face and have the freedom to interpret things differently. This open communication is what creates bonds and friendships between people.

Students in a class can get very bored of what the subject is about and when a teacher talking for a long period of time this may cause a student to became distracted by another thing in class. With this technology the teacher will be able

to know if the student is confused and not really paying attention and fix the problem.",3,7,0.765041172504425
176fde9,"In the artical, ""Making Mono Lisa Smile,"" the author writes about a new technology known as Facial Action Coding System, abbreviated to FACS. This technology reads peoples expressions and put together pecentages of how a person is feeling. Others claim that this is an excelent idea to use this in a classroom, but I disagree. It is a skill that most humans have, could be used in a way that it should not be used, and is unnatural.

Telling facial expression is a human skill that we recieve when we are born. The passage gave an example of a person and their friend. A person could easily tell how their friend is doing by looking and watching their facial expressions. Even if a baby was looking at another human being, the baby can tell hiw the ither person is feeling. Yes, it could be hard at times for they could easily have mixed emotions about something, but is that not what socilasing for? So why do we need a machine telling us how we feel in a classroom?

A student can easily hide their feelings. Rather that be out of shame, of pride, or even jalousy. Humanity would be lying to one self if all of us said that we have never hid our feelings. Actors and actresses around the world are hiding their true feelings to get into a charactor. These people are convencing themselves that they are a different person, which is what makes the acting industry so great and interisting. There are some students that are worried about their grades and some that could careless. Carelessness could come from boredom, however, if the subject is not appealing to them, they will be bored either way. There are certin subjects that most students find no intrest in that they have to take no matter what because it is required by the law of the state for education. For example, if a student enjoys math more than language art, they will most likely be bored of almost everything that is taught in the language arts classroom. For an educator to make it more intresting and apealing to this student, they might think about adding some kind of math into the subject. This will most likely not work because the student is in the mind set of laungue arts.

This machienery is unnatural to the Earth and to humanity. If we start using these in classrooms, it will most likely be taken farther and be sold to be at ones homes. it is said in the passage ""your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms..."" however, it was once imposible for a phone to fit in a pocket, it was imposible for an airplane to fly, and there are many othe ""imposible"" things that became posible. Now days with social media, people are more constricted in their ""self buble"" that they do not go and try to meet new people. If this machien was to enter our homes, the kids may never leave the house because ""it knows exactly what I am feeling.""

Over all, I do not think that this machienery is a good place for a school because it is a skill that most humans have, could be used in a way that it should not be used, and is unnatural. Humans need the interaction with other humans, they can easily fake their facial expression, and could become a cause of lower social skills. ",4,7,0.8575639724731445
177409b,"The new software can make 3-D models based off your face, to be able to do this software need to have fine accuracy. the software could identify humans emotions, but should be used in some cases. As in making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. What they shouldnt be allowed to do, is to choose certein ads and tv shows based off your emotions.

The new software is a compter that can know someones emotions just baseed off of one photo, or painting. This compter has such fine accuracy that it can make 3-D animated faces by the 44 major muscles thats in your face. This compter can know weather if your happy, surprised, anger, etc. This makes it easier for game designers to create people with better expressive faces, can help with video surgery.

The desgners of the computer also want it to show peolpe ads based off the peoples emotions, weather if there sad, happy, mad, etc. This would make people more incline to buy something based off there emotions. Which shouldn't be allowed, beacuse the computer could take control over peoples wants and there needs based off there emotions. This also is a lake of privite life, meaning that, beacuse your computer is scanning your face to ""finger out your emotions"" it also have a copy of your face. Which if people can get a hold that, they would have personal info. For example, with the new Iphone X. you can unlock your phone by putting your camera towards face. so if you happen to fall asleep, someone could get a hold of your phone and unlock it by putting it towards your face.

In conclusion the new computer software is a great creation which could help with computer animation and video surgery. But shouldn't be allowed to be used for ads, to make people but stuff based off there emotions.",2,7,0.6726101636886597
177a7d7,"School can be very boring to most kids. The endless notes and lessons from teachers, and the countless hours staring at a computer screen just isn't fun. Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute believes that every student's computer should have the ability to read its owners facial expressions to change the way it is being taught to benefit the kids! Schools around the nation need to look into getting computers with the ability to read their kids facial expressions if they want to see an increase in education.

Being able to read one's face seems like a far fetched idea, but it is very possible. Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of the FACS, or the Facial Action Coding System. Eckman has stated that the FACS can read six different basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Beckman also states that each emotion is paired with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" states Dr. Huang. With that being said, if schools could put a version of the FACS into computers in their school and study the way their students handled the lessons, they could modify their lessons accordingly.

Dr. Huang and colleague Prof. Nicu Sebe are looking for more ways to interpret the importance of communication between humans and technology. With the technology that the FACS provides, Huang realized something. He realized that if this was put into schools, it would change the way lessons were taught. Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" He proceeds to state ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that too."" Huang is trying to interpret that having these in the classroom would make learning more enjoyable and more affective.

There have been times in school where teenagers across the nation don't understand a lecture, and are too scared to ask the teacher in front of the whole class. If a system like the FACS was included in computers across the U.S. school's would see an increase in not just education, but an increase in attendance as well. If we want to take steps to advance in the educational field, then these are the necessary steps to take. Get new technology in the classroom!           ",4,7,0.8553112149238586
1792c42,"Well certenly we all have different facial expressions. But have you ever looked at somone and they look like they are made but they really are not? Well I feel that we shlould not use tecnology to view somone's feelings. A lot of differnt things can be misunderstood just with one little mistake. I will be telling you some reasons.

Tecnolgy does not alwys read ot tell the truth. It will be hard to tell if someone is really mad or has some feelings indide themselves if using tecnolgy. Mayeb the person can be happy and excited from the inside but from they outside they show a differnt facial expression. I feel that tecnology will just mess evrything up. We need to keep it all natural and they was it is now.

If somoene is das you can see it nut you don't know how they feel inside. You can probobbly draw a picture of them or soemthing instead of using tecnology. Also any type of facial expression sould be valuable in the classroom. You can't really judge a book by it cover. So really there is no need of using tecnology to see somones looks or to make them that way. Everyone has differnt reactions to differnt things.

So I think that tecnology shpuld not be usted to identify somone or to give them a value. They are how they are and that is how it is. In a classroom ther can also be differnt values and differnt emoltional expressions. Someone might feel down but we don't know that until they talk to us or let us help them. So no tecnoligy shpuld not be allowed to try and guess someone's value or feelings.       ",3,7,0.7252134084701538
17a53e0,"In the artical it give the example of smiling at a certain ad or frowning at another and the computer will no longer show you ads like that. I believe that the FACS software can be very useful in schools and other places. So here are some reasons that I believe that we should use this new software in our schools.

The new FACS software would be very useful in our schools because, like it states in the artical and by Dr. Huang, the computer could recognize when a child using the computer is starting to get bored. The computer could then change the way it is presenting that particular lesson to make it more interesting and enjoyable. This software could help bring up the overall grades by the student(s) because they now have an interest in learning the subject at hand.

In the artical it shows that this software could recognize the subtle emotions made by the Leonardo da Vinici's painting of Mona Lisa. FACS can recognize the facial expressions made by a child or teenager and recognize the six (happiness, surprise, anger, discust,fear and sadness) basic emotions, just like us people do in our everyday lives. The software can also recognize mixed emotions; FACS has found that the Mona Lisa is displaying 83 percent happiness, 9 percent discust, 6 percent fear, and 2 percent of anger.

Studies have found that when you are sad and fake a smile it can make you just a little bit happier. When moving your facial muscles it not only shows emotions, but also can produce them. When studying a lesson and a child is looking sad' the software could alter the lesson to, lets say, make the child laugh. Everyone knows that laughter is the best medicine. It may not make the child happy over all but it could brighten their day and make the lesson more appealing.

So, in conculsion I feel that the FACS software could be useful in schools and just about anywhere. There are so many things that this software could do to help in our everyday lives, from making lessons more enjoyable, to showing ads that you are interested in. FACS is just overall a good software to help computers figure out emotions and maybe brighten up the day. ",4,7,0.7469884157180786
17df6b8,"What do you think it would be like to tell others emotions with just a quick look? Well, with the Facial Action Coding System, FACS for short, you can. It quickly scans your face and tells your emotion. This shows being helpful for finding out friends emotions, showing the mindset in our classes and showing hidden feelings also leading to a glimp of mental illness. The real question now is, how will this be helpful in the classroom?

In the classroom, students show certains signs of how they feel. In paragraph 5, the text says "" ..you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."". Often when we are sad we frown or our eyes water, or when we are happy we smile but, just because we smile doesnt mean we are genuinely happy. The FACS has been classified the many different muscles in your face and has classified six basic emtions,as explain in paragraph 3. A quick look and we can understand if your happy, sad, or even bored.

While we are busy learning often times, we can zone out or we can be confused but not speak up about it. No worry, the FACS is here to help teachers understand how you feel. In paragraph 6 the author says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."". Later in the same paragraph it states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."". This shows the FACS has more of a use than just telling emotions, it can help you understand ways to make your classroom entertaining. It can also help you realize how fast certain students are working, or their mindset which they may keep hidden.

As humans, we often hide our true feelings. We may struggle opening up to others about how we feel out of fear of rejection or looking weak. Towards the end of paragraph 6, it says "" Most human communication in nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that,too."". The FACS is able to detect multiple different emotions. It can not only tell the basic happy,sad,or mad, it can tell confused, bored, or depressed all just by using muscles in your face. This can let us know how students really feel when they walk in. It can give them a glimps into what they may have going on with them mentally, giving more awareness in mental health. This can help save students.

The FACS can come as an important tool to both teachers and students. It can show students how to react to their friends feeling a certain way. It'll give teachers ideas as to how to make interesting yet, entertaining lessons for their students. Lastly, if can give us an idea of how the other around us truely feel and way to help them. The FACS can be very helpful for students now and caring for toward into life.",4,7,0.7880855798721313
17eb73a,"The Facial Action Coding System or FACS, in my opinion could be very helpful and useful in the future. The reason I say this is because, there are many students that get very bored, very unamused, confused and irritated with school work. And if we were able to have The Facial Action Coding System, it could possibly help students get back on track very easily.

In the text I read about how The Facial Action Coding System was able to, ""calculate emotions"". And like I said I think this could be very beneficial to students and adults in the Educational Field and the Work Field. For example, in the text it says, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This shows that the FACS is following your mood, so whatever mood you have the following ad will appear. This could be the beginning of participation. In addition, they also say that a classroom computer could detect or recognize when a student is becoming bored, confused, or unamused, according to Dr. Huangs prediction. They also say, ""It could be an effective human instructor."". This could be very effective on students and teachers. I say this because, if a student is bored or confused an ad that pops up could help them realize some things and help put them on track and hopefully get interested.

""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" according to Dr. Huang. This not only is efficient for students or teachers but, it is also beneficial to Surgeons. This technology is valuable and very useful it seems. The Facial Action Coding System is, a human emotion identifier or detector and this would be very useful to a classroom of students. And others.   ",3,7,0.8860172033309937
1831d64,"Due to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, scientist are speculating the idea of giving computers a new technology called 'The Facial Acion Coding System' which enables computers to identify human emotions. This new system could be very valuable for students.

Thomas Huang,of the Beckman Institute for advanced science at the University of Illinos, is working in collaberation with Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Ansterdam to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. After the process of constructing a 3-D computer model of the face is done by the two , Dr.Huang then relies on the work of psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman, creatorr of FACS (facial Action Coding

System).

""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disqust, fear, and sadness- and hen associated each with characteristic movements of he facial muscles"" (D'Alto , paragraph 3)

With this , computers are able to recognize these emotions and give each emotion a percentage to show how you are truly feeling. This could not only be great for communication with your computer but help any person express how they feel. This can help professors as well get a better understanding of how a student may be feeling at given time, which could excuse them or help in any way they could for the students benefit. Lots of people struggle to describe every facial trait that coveys every emotion and with this technology that shows you just that from just identifying facial mucsles, more people around you and even YOURSELF can begin to have a clearer understanding of how you are truly feeling in that point in time.

This is important for any person who may be going through a rough time and needs clarity to how they are feeing. In the future this could benefit so many people. Being able to have communication with your computer can also make the individual using the system feel more safe and understanding.

Although people dont enjoy those annoying ads that their computer may send out to them, imagine being able to have your computer recognize when you smile at an ad or ""pop up"" so you see a similar ad follow that one or if you dont like an ad so you frown, you then begin to see ads that have no relation to that last one. This could be extremely valuable to the PC you are on or any computer or device you choose to use this system on.

""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang ""So computers need to understand that, too."" (D'Alto paragraph 6)

With this, in this being very beneficial for any student, this could very much improve any computer as well. This technology could make computer- animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Anything can be improved by this expression and emotion detector.

If this sytem benefited in more than just the individual using it but also the computer or device being used for it, more things would begin to improve helping all citizens that even may not be using the system to their benefit.

In conclusion this system would be a great addition to add along to today's newest technology programs. Lots of people could be benefited from this and it could help improve lots of technology worldwide. More people could begin to learn more about themselves and start communicating with their computer by having their computer give them their emotions each day they logged. With this system it has the ablity to make users of any device of technology enjoy their experience more so than they would before, with everyone's help this new Facial Action Coding System could make a huge change in today's society.",4,7,0.8642374277114868
18397b4,"Its valuable to use a technolgy that can read the emotional expressions of a student. I find it important to know how someone really feels and what they may be going through. For an example, many people hide what they truly feel, because of what others think. I have a great friend that really does not express themselves when we go out and hang, she always seems to be bored. The reality is that she has fun and likes the things I like, She may seem like she is bored, but you can tell when she is enjoying herself, she makes a small smile and looks over to the other side when she does not want me to see that she is having fun.

Having Leonardo da Vinci's painting of Mona Lisa is a great way to tell others an expression of all six basic emotions. The way Leonardo used his painting to get every single muscle to go with its roll in each six basic emotional expression of Mona Lisa.

We all have six basic emotions, which are: happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and saddness. It is a surprise knowing when we humans are surprised an expression is shown in our faces, in the third paragraph the author says "" your frontails pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow"" when you're surprise. The most common facial expression is happy. In paragraph 7 it talks about how the instructions above were a happy face instuction, it also includes how their is a difference between a real and a false smile. Us humans have real emotional expressions. Our true expression never lie how we truly feel, as said in paragraph 8 "" faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politican or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

In todays world many people express themselves and many people don't. In the reality many people hide what feel and make a lying expression, with noticeable information on the lying expression. In instance in paragraph 7, with the instuctions of making a smile, Having a false smile is different than a real smile. For example, in paragraph 8 the author talks about the muscle in the smile, "" muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make a crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This tells how a false expression can be noticable and yet use to make a lie.

A technology that can read an expression of a student would be great, so that a teacher may know how a student is feeling and can help or observe. As known many famous people lie about how they feel and we as humans are no different than a celebrity. We all have emotion expressions that we express and falsely express to fool someone. Helping the ones who are sad and angry, fear and disgusted to succed and the ones who feel happy to succed as well.

Having the technology that can read emotion expressions in a classroom of student is valuable. Since most students don't want to express their feeling phiscally. These are my reasons why having a technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable.       ",3,7,0.7675753235816956
184bad3,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could be useful for people that are not around you enough that you have no idea what they are feeling but in most cases most people can tell when their friend is feeling down or not.""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can problably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This shows that most people do not know the specific traits that describe the emotion but most people also know that when their friend or family memeber makes a certain facial expresion that they are either happy, sad, mad, or even annoyed.

People can figure things out without needing a machine to do things for them. Maybe for paintings the FACS can be useful but not on ordinary people who know when their friend is feeling down or not. People do not need technology to do everything for them. People need to do things on their own make conclusions to things and if they have no idea what their friend or family is feeling they can just ask. ",2,7,0.8511936068534851
185b01a,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions to see humans' reactions while they are using their computers. Computers can recognize emotions by the way you look, and it is allow to the computers to understand your feelings, and to change the topic because they used this technology to see Mona Lisa's emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" When technology developed they started their project with a 3-D computer.

A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a ""Web ad appears"" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are.

According to the text in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang explains how the computer might work if the student doesn't like what he/she has in the computer and it says ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers can understand that, too."" It means that technology has developed, Dr. Paul Eckman and Dr. Huang created the FACS to see humans emotions, it has six basic as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The Doctors are showing that the new computers can see what it is in your mind because they improved the technology.

My conclusion is that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a good appications for a variety of industries because it is able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. The new technology has ""Empathy because it can feels someone else's emotions and can handle the complex algorithms. ",2,7,0.8658804297447205

18865e7,"The students of today are the leaders of tomorrow. This statement directly portrays that students have the potential to grow and do outstanding things. In order for this growth, a student must be well educated in his or her school teachings, and must be confident in his or her learning. The Facial Action Coding System is a new technological device that can read a person's facial expression. Using this innovative technology, a teacher can thoroughly recognize if a student is understanding the material, and is confident in their studies. The use of this face-reading technology for students is essential towards a student's overall education, as well as personal confidence.

Education in the classroom is very valuable towards a student's growth. Due to personal experience, a student does not only need the education itself, but needs to understand the education for more knowledge. This facial-reading computer can clarify if a student is actually understanding the education. For example, Dr. Huang stated, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Therefore, if a student is struggling, ""Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Therfore, this directly shows that the technology created can increase a student's performance in school. This can allow the teacher, or the program, to help the student understand more information when a student is struggling. This innovative technology can result in positive changes in student's education and school environments.

A student must be confident in what he or she is learning to advance in school. Without confidence, a student is often lost and loses hope in their personal ability. With confidence, a student is proud and is ready for any assignment given to them. This new innovative technology, the Facial Action Coding System, can determine whether a student is confident in their studies. As Dr. Huang stated, the technology studies facial expressions and muscles to determine what expression is being conveyed. Using this technology can allow the teacher, or the program, to determine if you are happy, proud, and understanding the material, or if you are angry, distraught, and unhappy with the material. This allows the teacher to provide personal help, so that therefore, they can provide understanding and you are more confident, and ready for subsequent information. This technology can help provide confidence for students in their respective studies.

Using the Facial Action Coding System in school environments would prove to be very beneficial and valuable. Through the ability of this new technology, understanding the education would greatly increase among students who need extra study tools and material. Confidence could be measued through the technology and help could be provided, so that students are better prepared mentally and physically for future assignments.

189a584,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the Facial Action Coding System, also known as FACS, may be a good thing to have in a classroom. If a child is acting up constantly, the teacher will be able to read his emotions and talk to that student. Teachers would be able to tell if their students are doing okay. FACS could help teachers understand their students better.

FACS would be a good way to tell a child's emotions if they are acting up at school. This would help teachers understand why this student is always having a bad time. Teachers could ask why this student feels the way they do. Maybe its something at home or something to do with bullying. The child could then be able to express their thoughts because the teacher will know why they are always misbehaving.

Teachers and students should have a close bond. You are around eachother all of the time until you are out of school. Teachers should get to understand their students feelings. If a student is having a rough day the teacher could maybe cheer them up. Most teachers let things slide even though they can read some of their students expressions. Expressions tell it all. FACS could help kids have a better time in school if they were able to have their expressions read so they could talk about why they are feeling a certain way.

Students can sometimes be in a bad mood becuase of things that happen throughout their day. If teachers showed concern with how a student is feeling it may create better respect for a teacher that shows concern. It could help that student know that the teacher understands them. FACS could maybe help kids that struggle in school because they think no one cares about how they feel. If FACS scans their expressions it could better help them know that teachers are paying attention to how they feel.

FACS could be a great way for schools to take the time to help students. Students go through so much during their time in school. This could make students have the desire to go to school because they will know that someone at school will be concerned about them. Some kids have parents that do not care. It could make these types of kids care about school. If teachers do something kind and thoughtful for them then they may have the desire to do the same for the teacher and maybe others.

To start off with I think this would be a. good idea because it says in the article ""for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by just simply by the look on there face."" This proves you can probably tell how one of your friends are feeling by just a expression on there face but my point is this that the technollogy can tell what emotions youtr friend is actually feeling. This would be helpful because sometimes you ask a friend what is wrong and they just say nothing but you know something is wrong by the way they are acting and this technollogy will help with that because and can tell what emotions they re actuallyu feeling

In addition, this technoollogy would also be a positive because you can know when anyone is happy,sad or frustrated. For example it says in the article ""imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad. For exampe, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow, but if yyou frown, the next ad will be different.'' This shows that you can tell how someone is feeling just based on if they smile or frown. Personally I am against this because I would love to know what everyone is feeling if they asre my frien oir not and know the real reason why they are acting the way they are no matter if they are sad or happy.

In conclusion, I am for this technollogy to read students emotinoal feelings because i would like to know how everyone is feeling and acting the way they are. For instance, what if it is a friendand no matter how close you are they will not t ell you if they are upset or happy and if you had this technollogy you could tell what they are feeling because they could lie and say they are not feeling anything which then this technollogy could then help with that.

18f9457,"Things in life has changed over the years 2018 is a whole new year with many things different then the 1980s for sure. In the past there was no phones or laptops. Now in the present almost everyday something comes out new. There is always a new software here and there. I do not find that a ""Facial Action Coding System"" is valuable for kids in the classroom.

I do not think that it is valuable for kids in the classroom. I do not think that it is valuable because if kids do not understand they will have a confused look on their face. They will also be the ones to ask questions about what they are confused on. Kids have many emotions but I do not think that it will be able to be hard to tell if they are struggling or not.

They said in the passage that it is a painting ""It's the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa."" Also in one of the paragraphs below it says that the human face has to have all 44 muscles in the face to be able to show if they are happy, sad, digusted, etc. In the painting how could there be 44 muscles is the real question. You can not paint 44 muscles in all the right spots when not everyones face is the same shape. Having the same size shape of the face and testing people I can see why they would say that you would be happy or sad. This is a painting and there is probably not a single person with the same face as Mona Lisa.

The ""3-D"" computer model could possibly show all 44 musles in the face but that would be a lot of face scanning because like I said before in my last sentence there could not possibly be someone with the same face shape. How can they test multiple people when those people could have the muscles all over there face. There is simple ones like the ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle"" which is above your eyes and the ""orbicularis oris"" which is around the mouth. that is only 2 out of the 44 muscles that they have to scan on a persons face.

If they wanted to test multiple people that would have to have someone who actually knows where all of the muscles are. In the right stop because if you guess the spots the mood can be wrong. I do not find that it should be used on anyone. Human communication is when two or more people talk together. That is one of the most simplest ways to find out if the kids in your classroom does not understand what you are going over with them. Emotional communication is when someone lets out all of the emotions that they have and will show them becasue they will either be mad with a grumpy face on or they will be upset and not smile at all.

I came up with that it is not valuable for kids in the classrooom because I do not understand why there would have to be a software out when the student could just ask a question in class or even ask after class. There's many other things to do then to have to scan the face and have someone point all of their facial muscles out to find out how they feel. Plus there are multiple kids in the classroom that you would have to scan and not everyone has the same facial structure that would be many times pointing out every single facial muscle and finding out how they feel when there are simpler ways to figure it out.

This is valuable information as it allows the teacher or instructor to modfiy the lesson so that it corresponds with the students emotion which in return allow for more students to be engaged with a class lesson.

This new technology also allows for the instructor to be able to empathize with a student that may be feeling sad or distrought.

In paragraph 9 it states that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may produce them."" this means that the instructor can use the feedback to put on a ""happy face"" to empathize with the students more which means that if you're smiling anyone around you is more likely to smile and empathize aswell.

The technology is in the path of achievment if the activity is in a progam by its self and not in the high school or middle school. Some students are pushing the edge to gradutate as it is. This will be something they will want to do and they cant if they are behind in their classes. These students already have way more technology on their hands now adays than they should. The technology is upgrading each day. FACS is not something that would help someones career with in the futrue. School's should be about helping kids get ready for the future.

The value of the technology of the FACS, is great in my opinion. the answer to a question that has been asked for a long time has finally been solved. That question is; is the mona Lisa smiling?

This evidence from the article I have found, tells us the emotions that are going on with the Mona Lisa painting. It says "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Most people have thought that the Mona Lisa was always, 100 percent happy. A lot of other people could not read Mona's facial expressions. Know one would have had the clue to think that the Mona Lisa painting would have had four different expressions in one picture.

My name is Nathan, and I am here to tell people about the Mona Lisa painting. I have read this article, and I have made some good questions, and opinions. There are a lot of facts in here, but also a good number of opinions as well. Obviously know one knows 100 percent, about what happened in the renisance back then. Know one Knows what had happened, because know one from our century, was around when that happend, because it was from a long time ago.

I think the Mona Lisa had mixed feelings when this painting took place. It might have ben her lifestyle, or her attitude that effected the vibe, and the attitude towards, her face that eventually went into the painting. It is so interesting to know what happend before, we lived.

We the people, can now know the Facial expressions, and the mood of paintings that were painted long ago. People have invented something that is extrordinary, and can change research, and that development is called FACS. FACS stands for ""Facial

Action Coding System.""

What the FACS does is it allows people to identify pictures, and expressions. It is all done on computer. This inovation is a big step, in learning. It inspires young kids to become even better researchers, with is great.

The people that are involved in this are very intelligent. and they come from good schools. Researchers in different schools use the FACS, too. The person that innovated the FACS is Prof. Thomas Huang, that is from the Beckman institute. That is for the Advanced Science at the University of Amsterdam.

To me some renissance painting look like they are showing no emotion at all. Then with this tool you could know how they afre feeling more and you can understand the painting more.

1ac7f5b,"In Nick D'Alto's article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, the value for technology is absurd, because in certain situations everyone should not be exposed to the emotions of others. For example, emotions are extremely personal and sometimes it is not technically appropriate to showcase every emotion you are feeling. A student or teacher could be going through something personal, that needs to be left out of the workplace and school. Success at school or work in general depends on how you engage in those specific tasks at hand, so the emotions the computer is claiming you are having should not interfere with specific things outside of your personal life. Detecting emotions should be left out of serious, and professional environments such as work or school. Lastly, the computer is only trained to detect the movement of the muscles in your face. But your face may not always match the feeling of emotion inside, so this may not be the most appropriate device to truly rely on.

The importance of keeping emotions personal, and not oversharing with people around you is extremely important. Most students are usually adolescents and they sometimes have a hard time expressing and controlling their emotions. So having a device eager to showcase their feelings can be dangerous and insensitive. Eckman has already begun to classify specific emotions including; ""anger, fear, disgust, and sadness,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 3). The negative emotions should not be shared! A computer should not illustrate how you are feeling on the inside to others. This can awaken a lot of frustrated, and haphazard behavior among teens if something is constantly around proclaimming it understands how everyone is feeling. D'Alto also states, ""associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" (Paragraph 3). The muscles in the face should not be studied by a computer, and they should not be able to invade the privacy of the muscle movement in someones face. Also, some may argue that their face does not always match what they are feeling, so that leaves alot of room for confusion, and flaws on the systems part. It's untraditional, and orthodox, and an invasion of mental privacy.

Everyone is different, whether life is amazing or terrible, someone should not be able to be read or determine how you are feeling by what a computer says about their face. Some teachers or students could be dealing some serious, and personal things that should not find their way into the workplace or school. But, if this device is constantly procclaiming a student or teacher is sad or upset about something personal it is completely unneccessary. Students should not know the personal lives of their teachers or vise versa. This is an ambigous invasion of privacy, and could potentially even amount to a crime or disservice to some people. D'Alto questions the reader, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" (D'Alto, Paragraph 6). This only has limited benefits and could cause immense problems in relation to others knowing personal things relating to your emotions. The specific boundaries it crosses especially if you are not well acquainted with the people constantly around you is alarming. D'Alto claims again, ""Can your lab partner recognize which one?"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 7). There should be absolutely no valid reason, why someone you may not know should be able to, and have the capacity to read your emotions from looking at you. In schools, sometimes in relation to this specific example, students are not acquainted with their lab partners or the people around them. So this would be like giving a stranger a clear look, and picture into another persons mind! It would be like being allowed to read the mind of others around you. This specific example is horrible in attempt to promote their product, and scares the consumers with the thought of others starring into their souls.

Technology has never been a reliable thing, it has never lived up to its name and full potential when people truly want it to. The thought of a computer having this amount of control is excessive, and unrealistic. In Paragraph 7, D'Alto states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 7). If our PC's cannot handle the Mona Lisa, how will they have the capacity to decode our real life, actively changing faces? Can the creators of this system not see their flaws? D'Alto continues to suggest, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code."" (D'Alto, Paragraph 5). This passage is inferring to the reader that the only logical way a computer can read information is through and electrical code. Humans do not produce emotions through an electrical code, so it is not logical to expect their emotions to be read to through an emotional code.

All in all, the idea was ambitious, but it defintely was not original or rationally thought out. The thought of a computer reading into personal emotions, attempting to decode issues that are too personal to be brought into school and work, and essentially incorrectly interpret emotions is absurd. This whole idea invades the privacy of the people in society, and is a very touchy subject that should not be programmed into a computer.      ",6,7,0.8393564224243164

Why make someone have to say something about it when the computer can do it for them.

1b0676e,"I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad.

Performing this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. We really don't know how much the computer can do, it can detect if you're happy or sad, and make computer-animated faces.

In a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now so I believe this is a great idea. Reason being is that we have video imagery, the amazing and undiscovered knowledge of a computer, and our own brains because we calculate expressions on our own every day. These our all major factors that align with the fact that I believe technology should be able to read students' emotional expressions.",2,7,0.8840218782424927
1b45c61,"Our facial expressions can tell someone a lot about how we feel about something or situations in our lives, sometimes even better than verbal communication. Being able to read these expressions and change the environment around us could help the human race acheive the goal of becoming monumentally more happy people. Throughout the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author mentions many studies and facts relating to the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. This would be very useful in the classroom because the studies shown have very intelligent figures present, the article includes a thourough explanation about how the FACS operates and succeeds, and how the technology could improve the willingness to learn and the ultimate goal of maintaining happiness.

First of all, in paragraph 6, the diction in the paragraph and the implementation of an interview with an intelligent figure relating to the product prove that this machine could make a vital difference in a classroom-style learning environment. For exmaple, author Nick D'Alto interviews Dr. and Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang works with other professors such as Nicu Sebe on the FACS, and in this pragraph he states many important facts about how computers could alter the learning environment based on how the student feels. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

Being able to modify a lesson for a single student rather than an entire group could make a huge difference. Rather than the teacher having to chage the whole lesson for the entire class, the computer could ""read"" and individual student's face and effectively personalize the lesson for that student alone. This technology could supply a much needed change to the sometimes ineffective teaching of an instructor.

Also, in paragraphs 7 and 8, detailed instructions are given on how the machine works and how it can detect fake emotions from real emotions. For example, at the end of paragraph 7, the author states the difference between the muscle movements in a real and fake smile. He then states how the machine looks for the muscle movements and formations of a real smile rather than those of a fake one. Also, in paragraph 8, even more examples of differences in muscle formation are used to show how the technology will in fact work in a classroom environment. The differences between a fake and real smile may seem like an easy task to distinguish in real life, and it may appear to be a problem for a machine. However, the information written by D'Alto from the interview with Dr. Huang show that the machine will have no problem distinguishing a real, genuine happy smile from a fake, intentionally deceiving grin. Therefore, a student could not effectively trick the machine into changing a lesson in a classroom environment.

Finally, in paragraph 9, a study on facial expressions and their relation to emotions is cited. In this study, many important ideas about feelings carried out by humans are stated with truthfulness and security. For example, the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion states that moving your facial muscles can not only express emotions, but can even help produce them. This states that real emotions can occur from just making a face. Even if the person who was making the expression originally was not feeling that emotion, they may in fact feel that way after one small change in their expression. Also, the author references a ""renowed drama coach,"" Constantin Stanislavsky, who states that he forced his actors to reproduce the actions of smiling and frowning so they genuinely feel happy or sad when on stage. Overall, a change in one small part of your face can change how you feel, and if this technology is implemented into classrooms throughout America, that one small change could alter the way students feel about learning.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as mentioned in Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" could be used in classrooms to successfully ""read"" the faces of students, alter the lesson in some way just for them, and make sure each student is happy with what they are hearing and seeing. If this technology is implemented into classrooms around the globe, students will be more excited about their learning experiences, possibly receive much improved grades, and be more happy people in gerenal. If the faces of the next generation are happier than ever, what's to come afterword could be even better.",6,7,0.8555651903152466

Muscles called orbiculariaris make crows feet around your eye, but in a false smile. the mouth is strectched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the riorius.

1b7ce1c,"Do students emotions really matter while you're trying to teach them? If a teacher were to use Facial Action Coding System to determine their student's feelings, they could tell what type of way they should teach. Could FACS improve the school systems all around the world? This system is great, if you have a hard time telling what peoples feelings are by their face and actions.

Have you ever been in class, and the teacher stops to ask you if you understand, because you may have had a confused look on your face? Your confused facial expression tells the teacher that you didn't understand what they are trying to teach, so they try teaching it another way or going over it again. Your expression told the teacher you weren't understanding, and needed to go over it again. It's not as difficult as it seems. This could help a teahcer in many ways.

If schools gave teachers Facial Action Coding Systems, they could use them to tell if a student is happy, confused, upset, or understanding. This is a great way for teachers to know how they should teach a lesson. Some teachers don't know how you feel about a chapter or lesson, unless you say something. Most students don't want to explain that they don't know what's going on, because they don't want to feel like they aren't as smart as the students that understand.

The systems know each muscle, and what it means when they move. FACS can tell what a person is feeling whether it's sad, happy, angry, confused, surprised, or more. By knowing this stuff, it is easier to communicate with a person. If someone is confused during school, and the teacher continues to teach how he, or she, has been teaching, the student won't be able to learn like they would if the teaching was brought to his, or her, level. Do you find it easier when a teacher teaches how you like to learn, or how other people like to learn? It's how you like to learn, right?

Facial Action Coding System can detect a person emotions. Is this a good system to have in a classroom? I believe it is. Emotions matter when you're trying to learn. How is someone supposed to understand something while they are confused? It's difficult, but it the teacher can tell you're confused the teaching might be changed to fit the students mind better. This is a great way to improve the learning system all around the world. ",3,7,0.7647156119346619
1bf4ba6,"While i feel like this could help with a few thing i feel as if it would just hurt humans in the long run because people will start to rely on the computers to tell them how other people are feeling, and that jsut makes it harder for the few people that help other people to help them when they are in need. This would be because we wouldnt be able to tell if ther person is scared or worried or just in need of help from anyone.

First of all, my biggest problem with this is that we cant rely on computers to tell us everything they cant feel what we feel when we look in the eyes of someone else. Not to metion that a computer can only do as much as we program it to do so it can only know all that we have discovered so it cant tell the different emotions of any accuratly because it doesnt know their give aways or how well they hide their emtions.

Secondly, you cant just base someone's emotions off of their facial expressions. This is because everyone including me find ways to hide how they are feeling and find ways to make their face look unemtional. To this effect people can control their facial muscles to a different degree of effiecenty. So, there for the computer would possible give inaccurate reports over and over again.

So, in the end I dissagree with that fact that this computer can tell how people are feeling based on their facial expressions. This is because for one they can't know for sure how well the person can control the muscles in their face, secondly they cant see the look in the eyes of the person and feel the emotion that is coming off the person who is looking at the computer. Finally, these are the reasons i can not agree with this article that you can tell someones emotions with just a computer instead of another human being.",3,7,0.7792843580245972
1bfcf1f,"Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Coding System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can ""calculate"" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex.

The first reason that the FACS is invaluable to the classroom is because there is no need to use technology to ""calculate"" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day,"" He further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FACS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology.

Computers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" There is always a human instrcutor( the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning.

The final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First of all, emotion differs from person to person. In the aritcle Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" but he also stated, ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a students is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article.

In conclusion, the FACS is too redundant and under developed to be of any use for a classroom enviorment. It is invaluable and there are mulitple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time where classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students.",5,7,0.8462769985198975
1c1c470,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is valuable. I believe this technology would be great to use in a classroom. It would really help the teacher with his or her lesson. Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If a simple classroom computer can determine a students' emotions, that would be a great assistance to a teacher. The teacher would then know if he should go into greater detail or if he should make his lesson plan a little more interesting.

Human Beings can be really good at hiding their emotions. With the Facial Action Coding System no one would be able to hide their true emotions. If someone was really depressed, but they portray themselves to be happy, this technology could stop that person from hurting themselves or others. If a school therapist or school social worker had this technology it would make their jobs so much easier. They could sense what the students are really feeling, rather than what the students want them to think their feeling. Also, the school therapist would know if the patient would need to be prescribed any medicine.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be a good idea is because, as stated in the article, it could reveal so much about the science of emotions. The FACS (Factial Action Coding System) could detect a false smile. If you are not feeling geniunely happy, if you are just ""putting on a happy face"" this technolgy would be able to see through what your false act. This new technology could become the next big thing. It would be able to uncover the truth about alot of people.

The last argument I am going to state on why the FACS would be valuable on detecting students emotions is that the technology could tell whether a student is telling the truth or not. The article states in paragraph 8 that usually when someone squint their eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of their eyes usually means that their not being thruthful. FACS uses muscle clues to determine whether a person if being truthful or not. This would be great in a classroom. For example, if someone is being bullied and they tell the teacher but the bully says he isn't bullying anyone, this would be great for the teacher. The teacher would know which one of her students is telling the truth.

In Conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be a superb idea. This new technology would not only be very interesting but it would also save many lives. This technology could be used in many different jobs. It could also help many people. With this technology you would no longer have to take someones word on how their feeling, even when you have a gut feeling telling you otherwise. Rather than assuming what someone is feeling you could now know for sure with the Facial Action Coding System. ",5,7,0.9093239903450012

because, it would help with alot of different things going on in school. Like for example it could tell what kind of mood the student is in so the teacher could know how to approch them wihtout the student "" going off."" This would even help with knowing if the student gets the lesson the teacher is teaching by thier facial expressions.

Like i said it helps with alot of differnt things, the author says, "" hold on, can we acually ""calculate"" emotions."" yes we can, its a ""smart computer"" & its like a person. I say its like a person because, say you see your friend and he/she has a frown on her/his face. You auctmactly know theres something wrong because he/shes frowning & thats also what the computer is bacislly doing.

This would benifit the classroom by letting the teachers know what makes them instrasted in the classroom. When you look tierd and about to sleep the teacher will try and do something different to help you pay attantion. Just like speaking in a different tone or walking around the classroom to get someone's attantion.

Us humans do the same thing as-well just like easily looking at someones face on a date or in a classroom to she either they like you or they don't like the way your expressing yourself. It would also help if your in a room full of strangers and wanting to get to know them but you can't really know what to say or if they would like the conversation.

What the computer does when they are calculating a face is that they compare it with a neutral face. Just by using video imagery, the new emoion- recogition software to track the facial movements. There are facial expressions for each emotion on your face but even tho individuals often show varying degrees of expression.

All in all this invention would be amazing to have. You can use it on students and see if there instrasted in a subject and how well the teacher's behavior effects them as well. You can use it on some painting to see what they were feeling while they were getting drawn.     ",3,7,0.8829178214073181

Now there is technology to help decipher what that perosn is feeling. Dr. Paul Eckman has created a process when a computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face to tell what emotion is on it, Facial Action Coding System or FACS.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the use of Facial Action Coding Sytem (FACS) to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable education wise and emotionally.

Knowing a student does not understand or is uninterested in a topic can help teachers in a tremendous way. If there is

""a classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson"" (D'alto). By modifying the lesson, the teacher will make a change to the lesson. After changing the lesson to an easier way for some students to understand, it can help the students grades. When a student is bored of the topic, the teacher can fix the lesson to be more interesting.

Not only will education be better for students, but emtionally they will feel a lot better. Dr. Eckman designs his system with the basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (D'alto). In classrooms, students may show emotions other than being bored or confused, but show something is wrong with them. Teachers can be notified that a student may seem troubled and can assist emotional support. Humans can tell when their friends are feeling by just giving a glance, but some may have trouble telling what emotion the other person is feeling (D'alto). With a new computer software that stores similar anatomical information as electronic code, created by Dr. Huang, a classroom computer is able to tell what emotion a student is feeling (D'alto). Teachers may not be close with some students, so they are unable to tell what the stduent is feeling. However, the computer can signal that a student is feeling a certain way to the teacher.

Students can excel education wise and emotionally due to the use of technology to read their emotional expressions in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"".

Currently, students are becoming to feel sad or unwated, and tradies will unleash in school. With technology one step ahead, it is able to stop students from feeling unsafe, sad, or confused.     ",4,7,0.8921224474906921

Knowing the FACS can identify human emotion, it can understand students thought process trough out the lesson they are given. Due to personal experiences, everyone has once in their lives misunderstood what was said to them in class. With the FACS system present the teacher can simply slow down the pace of their teaching to where each and every student can understand.

The FACS system can prevent common problems in a classroom environment happen before it even occurs. If there were to be conflict between two sudents, before a fight occurs, the teacher can simply call the student up to their desk so the computer can scan their face in order to find out how and why one student is acting towards another.

Lastly, the FACS system will force teachers or professors to break down lesson in their simplist forms. Understanding the FACS system can be used like a translator, translating nonverbal communication, the teacher can quickly switch up teh style of their teaching.

They have made countless observations and have even created this new technology that detects her emotions through facial recognition. Creator Prof. Thomas Huang has named this the Facial Action Coding System. This may not seem very important in the outside world, but the use of Facial Action Coding could be very beneficial in classrooms because it could understand the student's frustration and confusion and would modify the lesson to better fit the student, counselors could use it ot help determine how a student is truly feeling, and it would help teachers better understand the students who rarely talk in their class.

Facial Action Coding could be benificial in classrooms because the technology could understand the student's frustration and confusion and modify the lesson to better fit the student. In schools all around, students are starting to give up. They get too angry at their homework and decide that they don't want to work on it anymore. The problems don't change--but with the Facial Action Coding System, the problems and even the lesson itself could change and become easier for the student. This would allow for the student to wrap their mind around the concept that was given to them. In the article, Dr. Huang states in paragraph 6, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when astudent is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This quote tells its readers that that is what Dr. Huang wants this new technology to do. Teachers have to follow a guideline and a lesson plan; they have to be on track as to what the students are learning. Dealing with almost fifteen to twenty students a class, the teacher cannot physically help a student one-on-one all of the time. The Facial Action Coding System, however, would be able to. Making it more simple and more efficient for both the students and teachers. Counselors could also use this technology.

Counselors could use the Facial Action Coding System to determine how a student is truly feeling. When sitting in a counselors office, students may be tense or very nervous. Whatever they're in there for, the counselor will have to help that student. With the techonology, counselors could take one look at their face and find out what's bothering them if they are not completely open about it. The counselor would be able to find out if they're sad, upset, scared, or just pulling their strings to get out of class. A counselor's job is to make sure that the students on campus are mentally in check and are ready for the next school year with their classes and progress. When a student enters their office, the technology could sensor the student, making the counselor's job easier and time efficient. When the counselor is done with the student, they're sent back to class. The system could help students and teachers there as well.

The Facial Action Coding System may be useful to help teachers understand the students who rarely talk in class or are deaf. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang makes a wonderful point--""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" In class, students will nod their heads when they agree or understand something that their teacher is presenting them with. But what if they don't nod? Facial Action Coding could help the teacher understand that they're going to fast or that the student is lost. The teacher would then be able to assist in further explaining the lesson or even trying to make the lesson more fun and exciting. There are some students who would rather sit in their desks, avoid being wrong, and won't ask questions because they're too shy. This system would give the oppourtunity for students that were never given the chance.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System could be very useful in classrooms due to being able to modify and better fit the student based on their emotions, counselors being able to use it, and as well as letting teachers better understand students who are either deaf or rarely talk. Facial Action Coding may only progress, and progressing it shall.",5,7,0.8626726865768433

Before we would do anything to be liked by our peers, but now we will do anything to be liked by the thousands of blank profiles on social media. This does not diminish the adcances in science, computers, and the now easy access to information we have but technology always brings with it amazing powers but also terrible consequences and we must use it responsibly, In the artile ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it says ""In face, we humans perform this same impressive calulation every day. For instance you can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Our human brains are just as powerful as the machines we create. We do not need artificial software to bring us together we only need to encourage and foster a society of empathy and compassion. The use of this emotion-recognition technology in classrooms would not be effective if teachers and instuctors are not already avaliable to address such issues as demotivation, boredom, and more extreme cases of mental disorders. We can make genuine connections in the real world to solve these problems instead of expensive new technology. Schools may not be able to even afford them, but others might.

Others might use this techonology for less admirable means than classroom disinterest. The article states other uses, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This does not seem as nefarious if you do not think of the further consequenses. Privacy is becoming a scarce commodity in the twenty-first century, as I type this companies and corporations are making money selling my (and your) personal information to thrid-parties. In today's society, money is the sole drive for success. This type of emotion-recognition software would be less likely to be used in classrooms and more likely to be used to sell more stuff.

In conclusion, this techonology could only be used in a regulated and safe environment in order for it to be effective. The consequenses of this technology would be an increased of alienation and the malpractice of this technology. One day this technology might become widespread but before than happens it is even more important for one to address the societal impact technology has already had on us and foster a society of compassion where this technolohy would thrive.

They try and hid there emotions for the people around them. That is there choice some people are quit and do not like to talk about there feeling and other like to open up and talk. It would be wrong if this system came out and is would show others how people are reallly feeling. Instead of the Facial Action Coding System showing our feeling it would be taking are feeling away in a sense. This Facial Action coding system is showing up everywehere, in classrooms, in the theathed and around the house. People can never hide for there true emotions.

How this works in a classroom. A computer in a classroom can reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored. And his advance technology can change the lesson and make the lesson essaier so the kids can understand it. This is wrong becasue if a kid does not get something they usally raise his or her hadn and asks a question. Kid would not do that becasue the computer is just changing it for them. The kid would lose a lot of people skill. Which are very importan to learn as a kid. Where is the teacher, does this system just replace the teachers all over the world. or do we still have them and the computers just tell them what to teach and what to said. This system could make the kids very self contes too becasue the system is just telling the kids that they do not understand it and that they need the information to be dumbed down for them. This system does not belong in a classroom.

People use this while looking in a mirror because they want to know if looking in a mirror suggest an a emotion. This system says that the musculs in our face know the different between a genunie smaile and a forced one. Why does it matter a smile is a smile. The only people that would be able to tell the differnce are the people that you are really close with. people that do not know you would not even care about your emotions. the system is pointless people have the right to hide there emotions. And if they want to share them witht the people that they are cloase to then good for them. This system should have be used when you look at yourself in a mirror. You personal should know what your emtionsa and feelings are.

People use this on stage actors use it to make more emotion on stage. And again why do we need this. If you are a weel tought actor you should not need a mechain to make emotions or faces for you. The hole point of being an actor is becasue you are good at expressing you feelings. How do the comman people know if the person is a good actor if these meachines are making their faceal expressions. This system is unneed in the arts the actors are capale of making there own faces and emotions.

Why do we need to know the percents of emotions. Do some people really care that much that they need to make it a math . It is very unhealth to make every little thing excat. Not everythiing is perfect nor will it ever be. Our emotions should not become a math proble. becaue the only person that can truly solve it is yourself. Emotions can be all over the place but that is apart of life. And if we had a system to make every little emotion perfect, then how would we learn. How would we know what hurt feels like how would we deal with that hurt. Maybe this system tells you that your 20% happy 50% hurting. It makes your think that is right. Thats how you really feel, computers can not tell you how to feel.

I feel like this system is telling you how to feel. When the people used the video imagery to see what the peainting would look like with a smile. That was okay becasue they were just seeing they were not changing anything perimatal. when you do soemthignfor fun to see what it looks like that is okay. But when you start to make it real. That is what is wrong making our emtions a math problam, telling us how to feel, and what emotions to feel when we are look in the mirror. That is not okay its wrong, you have to let us learn for our emotions in order to change them for the better. If we are sad then find somehting to make us happy. If we want to be alone let us be alone. Let use be human and feel are own emotions. ",4,7,0.7959951162338257

In the passage Making Mina Lisa Smile using detail from the text its asking me to discuss whether the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a

classroom is valuable and from the text i have pulled out a couple of facts to support my anwser ,my first reason is that in paragrapgh four its says the facial expressions for each emotion are universal observes Dr.Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression , well that statement right there gives us a idea on how every emotion is differnt and unique in it's own way and an example to support my first respone

is in paragrapgh 5 it says for instance, you can probably tell how my friend is feeling simply by the look on her face, Of course ,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried and etc, Artist like sanVinci studied humananatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enought to convet specific emotions.

The monta lisa

demostration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while showing just how much this computer can do , Dr.Huang

predicts that it could modify the lessom like am effective human instructoe, The same technology can make a computer-animated faces more expressive- for videogames or video surgery.

1e54a02,"Facial Action Coding System I think is a good idea because if someone is trying to figure out how you are feeling and you don't tell them they can look on the computer and tell what your emotions are. In the passage it tells that the computer is 3-D and has 44 major muscle. This tell us that if a friend is feeling a way you can tell and you would actually know itts true and not false. In paragraph one it explains to me that there are six basic emotions and they are happiness, surprise , anger ,and ect. For example your frontalis muscle above your eye raises your eyebrows when you are surprise. Some people wouldnt think that this is possible but I think its something good.

When a student is looking at the computer they can pick up all emotions like if you have mixed emotions or just one. Someimes teachers want to know how they students are feeling but just don't want to walk up to the and just ask. This computer I think was a wonderful thing that someone can make. If I ever had this computer it would be very useful to me because want to know how others feel.

Some people who try to just look at someone and tell how they are feelings is not always helpful they might think its one thing but its another. Most people are not just good by going off someone's look but this computer can help out alot you don't need to try and guess what that person is feeling. Evan when some artist are trying to draw a ppersons emotion they don't always know either they would also need the computer . Dr. Huang says in te story that Da Vinci has and comuter when he draw so that he could get the specific factial expression.

If I was to get one of these computes i would like to use it on everyone around me because I love to see people happy and if they are not I would like to make there day. If I am taking a test and I get confused I know that the computers see that and the teacher would know and try to help me out a little. Using these can help everyone out in so many differen ways.

Eveyone should have one of these or get an computer lie this one. If you really need to know about smeone you just would look on it to see what it is. This would be good when a school have a play and the people that are watching them need or want to figure out how the characters feel.   ",3,7,0.8732861280441284

The sofeware is like math it can calculate you all your forty-four major facial muscles and calculate your emotion. For like example , if you raise both of you eye brows it most likley means that your facial expression is showing that your suprised to hear or see something.

I think that this sofeware is a pretty nice technology that can be usefull if your a teacher, rehabilatation center helper. For a teacher it can be a good technology to use at school so you can know more about the kids facial expression.

Nobdy need a sytem to show there emotions. How would you know if they dont want to show it. Not everybody what to express they feeling. Sometimes they want to keep it to they self . If they wanted to express they self im pretty sure they would of went to the family doctor or something.

The Facial Coding System should be used is classrooms all around the world. It would enable to modify their teaching methods.

First, The author describes how the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The article it states that "" The process begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face."" The author descibed what the computer has to do first to be able to evaluate a face. The text also states that ""new computer software store similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This is another way the Facial Action Coding System uses code to evaluate emotions.

Second, The benefits of having a computer that uses technology to read the emotional expressions of students. The article states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This could help teachers modify the lesson the help the students learn the lesson without getting confused or bored. The article also states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal."" This shows that when a student is bored or confused the student is unlikely not to use word but they are mostlikely to use nonverbal cues. Such as putting thier head on the desk.

Third, We as people can tell when a freind is sad, happy, or mad. The text states that ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait."" That is one reason why classrooms shuold have the computers to identify human emotions in class. The text also states that ""We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day."" However we might not always be able to convey the correct emotions.

Inconclusion, The Facial Action Coding System should be use in classrooms. There are student that get bored and then don't understand the topic. When a student doesn't understand the topic the student fails the test over that topic. Therefore with the use of the Facial Action Coding System shuold be used in classrooms all across the world.",3,7,0.8963217735290527

In the first paragraph it talks out the percentage of her happiness,fearful,anger,disgusted.

We may never know that this might of been true since the face they scaned was a drawing of her and she is no longer with us but we can say its ture for now. Computers now in days can give errors or even shut down, they can even restart if not used right or overheat. That can prove that what they scan can't be ture.

Yes it would be awesome to scan faces but is it even worth to pay? like we already know how we feel everyday why should we have a coding system that should code the wrong information and makes us seem like we wasted our time and money. A other problem would be is it even safe? how does the FACS even work? I wounldn't pay money just to get hurt or even have marks on my face just to see my emotion.

1efd3f9,"With the new discovery of new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), many people argue whether or not this is vaulable to the students of a classroom. This new technology enables a computer to identify human emotions and improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others.

With much research done by professionals, this new emotion-reading technology would be valuable and effective in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

As a student learning in a classroom, one of the most important things is reamining focused and obtaining all of the information that is being given.

In order to receive the right education, it is vital that a lesson does not bore or confuse the person learning or else they will not fully understand what is being taught, and that is not good.

With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, according the Prof. Thomas Huang, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

The computer can then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor in order to make what is being taugh more understandable.

With the computer technology, students can receive an education with a learning method that is specific to them.

Instead of a student being bored or confused and losing focus while learning a lesson, the Facial Action Coding System can now modify what they are being taught in order to make their education more effective and specific to them.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator the FACS, has classified six basic emotions in which the computer can analyze; these emotions include: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

By identifying one or more of these six emotions in a student, this will help the computer revise a lesson that would best fit the student's needs.

With this new technology, the computer will be able to detect if a student is fearful of the new material being brought their way.

As predicted by Dr. Huang, this can help modify the lesson so the student becomes more comfortable with what they are now learning and less fearful.

With the help of this computer program, it can also detect anger in a student whether it be at themselves for not fully understanding the material or at the lesson for not teaching it in a way that best suits the student; this will let the computer know that it needs to change the way it is teaching the lesson in order to help benefit the student.

If a student shows the emotion of happiness, it will let the computer program know to continue the lesson as it is.

With this new technology being able to detect six basic emotions, this will help the computer program FACS to modify the lesson in order to benefit the student with their education and make it easier to understand the student's frustration.

With classrooms around the world becoming more technologically advanced, this new computer program will help many students with receiving an education that is specific to them and will help benefit their learning experience.

Although

this can only be used to read the emotions of a student, it can still be very valuable in a classroom.

The FACS can read the emotions of a student and can, according the professional Dr. Huang, modify a lesson in order the suit the needs of the student.

This can be very beneficial to the education of a student since the computer program can detect when they are not understanding a lesson and can then change the lesson the benefit the student.

With the computer program being able to detect six basic emotions, this makes it easier to help the computer understand exactly what the student is feeling when learning new material; this can help understand a student's frustration or happiness of the lesson they are learning.

With all of the research done by professionals and evidence shown, the use of the

Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom can be valuable.           ",3,7,0.8870312571525574

Another way this could help is when detectives or police men would need help reading a person, which would really help by showing the person is faking the emotion or not, by reading the certain muscles need to make person actually smile or just a fake smile which fools everyone.

Dr. Eckman is able to detect if someone is happy or sad without FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). You can detect someone's emotions by the way they are acting.

Even without the new technology that the doctors invented to detect your emotions people should be able to tell if someone if happy, sad, etc. People should be able to tell if they are sad when they arent talking as much as they used to or mad when they have a bad attitude. They could tell when their happy when they are acting normal and laughing at jokes. Also your mostly with the people that you know the best so you should be able to tell their emotions.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS, is able to detect someones emotions without his new system. If Dr. Eckman could teach people how to detect someone's emotions then it would spread across the world then nobody would need the new system. When Dr. Eckman told us to look in the mirror and do the three steps he provided he was teaching us how to detect if someone is happy. Dr. Eckman created something that could be easily taught to people around the world. If people are able to be taught what FACS could do then therefor you do not need FACS.

Many people all around the world mostly are only with people that they really know personally. You should be able to detect how someone close to you is feeling be how they are acting. If they are not acting normal they obviously something is wrong, so now you need to find out what is wrong. They could detect if they are sad if they are not talking a lot and moslty just sitting around. If they are mad you could just look at their facial expressions when you tell them something and be able to tell if they are mad. So you should easily be able to detect the mood of somebody be the way they are acting.

The FACS that Dr. Eckman created is most likely expesive to make and install, also could talk alot of time. So if he would just teach people how to detect peoples different emotions by their facial expressions they he could be saving a lot of time and money. Once Dr. Eckman has taught people then people will then begin to teach other people, which then would lead to nobody needing the FACS.           ",4,7,0.6890339851379395

But first we have to figure out what technology can do this and how the process works. First the technology used for this type of research is called Facial Coding System and it enables computers to identify human emontions. They way the technology works is that when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. For this to work all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human mucles to recongize the face it has to work with. They're 6 emontions that the FACS is looking for, the emontions its looking for are happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear and sadness for the technology to fully work on a human face.

Different ways that FACS can be most valuable would be at school with all of your classmates would be if the school want ts to get on what emontions you are having when you take a picture. They could use this information to find out if a kid is dealing with sadness,anger, etc. Another way that this type of technology can be valuable for my classmates would be when we watn to figure out how the technology works or if we want to figure out what emontions we are expressig of taking one picture.

On the other hand the FACS wouldn't be valid in my opinion at the same time because since we are teens we don't really care about what emontions we are feeling at that time and moment. All of my classmates really care about in the present time is being online and using other technology instead of FACS. The different technology I'm talking about all of the technology on are phones, tablets, video game conseles.

Would Facial Action Coding System be helpful for me and my classmates. I'm not sure because it could be either ways when you are thinking about it becuse there are some pros and cons to FACS being helpful.

The FACS has classifies six basic emotions which are: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These emotions are associted with the movement of the facial muscles

The use of this technology could be very valuable for students during class. Identifying how a student is feeling about a topic, seeing if they're being truthful to questions, and to be able to see how a student is actually feeling emotional wise.

First, this system would allow teachers to be able to see how well they're students feel towards a topic. ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored'"" ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" The detection from the software would help out teachers to understand, which students are lost or which students don't have any interest in learning. Which allows the teachers to either change up the lesson or find another instructor to teach the student.

Secondly, it would allow teachers to be able to see if a student is being truthful or not. ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth."" ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a differnt muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would give teachers the oppurtunity to see if specific students are lying about understanding a topic and if they actually did their homework or not. If a student were to lie about understanding a topic, the teacher could help them out. Also some students get away with lying about homework or other things. So this would allow teachers to either give more time to a student or give them their rightful score.

Lastly, teachers would be able to see how their students are actually feeling emotionally. ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" ""New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others."" Although students feelings should be kept private, trying to help out a student isn't harmful. Many students hide about how they're feeling or lie about it. So being able to detect how a student is actually feeling can allow the teacher to seek care or show sympathy.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding system would be quite valuable for students in a classroom. It would benefit teachers by allowing them to see how their students are feeling about the class, if they're lying about understanding something or something else, and how their students are actually feeling.

1fd8cbc,"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" is technology that can be used in the class room because some people can't figure out how good or bad someone is feeling. Teachers will be able to know if the student is learning or eithor not paying attention or sleeping in class. It'll be easier for them to know what's false and what's true expression in their situation they could be in.

In difference in the situation students can't understand someone's expression. Thanks to the technolgy now it'll be easier to figure out students emotion or anyone. The article states, "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.""""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.""

Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. In my opinion it'll be a better way to learn/read better on our emotional expressions because you""'ll have more information and could know more about everything you want or need to know about the expressions. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day, for instance, you can probably tell how a person is feeling simply by the look on their face.           ",3,7,0.9017916321754456
1fda3aa,"Recently new technology has advanced at an absurd rate with phenomenal results. The tasks that these new materials and ideas can perform are a gateway to new discoveries. Inventions such as latest innovation with computers and their ability to detect honest facial emotions.

In the first passage the author introduces Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe as they collaborate to deploy an elite communication system to illuminate the realtionship between computers and humans. In the text, the author explains the functions of the new computerized model of how the emotion facial indicator acts. In paragraph 3, he says, ""Movement of one or more musclees is called an ""action unit""."" He specifies the different controls of how the computer navigates through the coding of facial features and muscle movements. The author then mentions Dr.Huang's perception of his new technology when in the text it says,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"". ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". Dr. Huang talks about how his computer enginnering works and the capabilities it possesses. In the passage, the auhtor says,""Yet Dr. Huangobserves that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisly enough to convey specific emotions."". This could have interested and motivated Dr. Huang to use modern resources to use da Vinci's technique and find the emotions from facial recognition.

The author mentions an example in the text explaining how a web cam could help students in school. In the passage, it reads,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This puts another idea of the table for helping students who often find a specific subject boring or difficult to overcome that obstacle with a simple facial recogntion. This technology could help save students who struggle with schoolwork and manipulate the task to be a more understandable one.

In summary, using this advanced computer system can help individuals feel better, in the last parapgraph the author mentions, ""By the way, did making a happy face in this experiment make you feel happy? According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, movjng your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them."". This is the technology that could be put to good use in order to maybe even help people feel beter when using it in different activities. The task that these new materials and ideas can perform are a gateway to new discoveries.",3,7,0.7111130952835083

Being able to associate muscle movements throughout ournface with the true current emotion someone has seems to be impossible, by the Facial Actiom Coding System can attest to that. The Facial Action Coding System could revolutionize the way classrooms are run and impact schools in a great way by altering the way classes are run based on students emotions. It would be a great idea to have this system installed as a classroom computer because it could modify the lesson for students based on their understanding, teachers can detect the truth of students emotions about the class, and it can help students better their emotions or see for themselves how their emotions seem to be.

Having this facial expression reading system installed in classrooms can benefit many classes with better understandings. “Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor [based on the students emotions].” Detecting how students truly feel about the lesson could be a big help in how classrooms run. For instance, if the majority of the class is sensed to be confused about the lesson, teachers are then able to see that they need to spend more time on it or reevaluate how they are teaching the lesson and slow it down. If the computer senses that the class is bored, they may not learn as well if they don't care about what they are learning so the teacher could possibly change up the class with a game. Overall it could greatly benefit classes as a whole.

This computer can help teachers and they way they run the class and teach the lesson as well. Teachers could use this technology as a baseline for themselves to see how their classes react and feel about the way they run their class. “A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,” Dr. Huang predicts. This would greatly benefit students as well because no students want to tell their teachers that they hate the way their class is run and be honest with them. This would give teachers true insite about their class and would want to make it as beneficiary to students as possible. If teachers saw that students weren't enjoying their class they could altar it in some way to make it better for everyone.

This system being installed in classrooms could also help students see what their emotions look like and possibly make them better. If students knew what their emotions looked like outside of themselves, it could be a big eye opener for them to see what they may seem to be like and that they may not know themselves. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" If students saw how their emotions looked and they weren't good they could try to change them which studies show actually could change them by just having different facial expressions. This could help all students if they were mad or sad and it detected that, they could put a smile on their face which may actually help better their emotions.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a great idea to put into classrooms that could better everyone as a whole class as well as individually. It would be an amazing idea because it could modify the lesson for students based on their understanding, teachers can detect the truth of students emotions about the class, and it can help students better their emotions or see for themselves how their emotions seem to be. Every teacher would run their classroom to make it as beneficial to students as possible if they could and with this installed into classrooms, it could happen. The Facial Acting Coding System would change classrooms for the better and help teachers and students expedentially.",5,7,0.8604599237442017
2009f18,"I would not be against the idea of this because it could actually help one when they show a specifc expression on their face. In the article, it already shows what the Mona Lisa was expressing when she was being painted by Leonardo da Vinci. I think that showing our expressions could actually make others think you're happy, but also sad, angry, disgusted, fearful,

or surprised. These expressions mostly depend on the muscle of the face like the frontalis pars lateralis or the orbicularis oris. These specifc muscles in the face is what giveaway the expressions of what we are feeling.

In this article, Dr. Huang observes how, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" People perform the same ""calculation"" every day when we see someone. You can already tell how your friend is feeling just by looking at the face and observing the facial expression they are making. Artist Leonardo da Vinci, however, studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey that specifc emotion. Dr. Huang says that he himself stored a similar anatomical information as electronic code.

This would make this idea very valuable to students in a classroom. This could also be used to understand the muscle of the face to show what expression people could be making nowadays. This could also produce emotions instead of just ""using"" the same one every day. Actors could also learn more about the muscle of the face whenever they are in a play. This knowledge could help others know about the face.",3,7,0.8242750763893127

It is especially vital for teachers to know how their students are enjoying the lesson. With modern technology that can read emotions, teachers may be able to better understand their students, and create a lesson that is fun for everyone.

From an emotion test taken on the Mona Lisa, Professors Thomas Huang, and Nicu Sebe detected the lady's exact emotions based on what is portrayed in the painting. According to the technology, she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfuk, and 2 percent angry."" This technology used on a classic Renaissance painting could be used in schools to help teachers better understand the students, and therefore help to make the class fun for every one. In the article it gives the example of a class room computer recognizing when a student is bored or confused, then modify the lesson to fit that person's personality.

All in all, this sort of technology that can read emotions would be helpful for schools because it could help students understand their school work better, and in turn help them do better in school. ",2,7,0.8044570088386536
202006a,"The Facial Action Coding system is valuable for students. One reason is that we can see how diffrent people felt in diffrent important events. The second is that the computer can change up the learning method if they see that the student is getting bored with the way they are currently learning. The last reason is that it could keep students more happy throughout the day. This is a huge improvement to the school system.

The first reason that the Facial Code System would be valuable is that we can see how difffent people felt during important events. For example they showed us the Mona Lisa and the results from it. If we look at all the imprtant events and see pictures of these people then we can see how the people really felt during these events. For example the Mona Lisa. In the painting she is smiling but it was one of the first paintings of people smiling so maybe she could have been worried or sad, but the results stated for the most part she was actully happy.

The second reason is that the computer in a classroom coud see how we feel and if we become bored and uninterested. In paragraph 6 it states , "" A classroom comupter could recogniz when a student is becominf confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" So overall we would learn better in the sense that it would switch up the lesson so that we woudl stay focused. It would keep us interested. Also overall we would learn the material faster since we wouldn't be procrastinating as much.

The final reason is that it could keep students more happy throiughout the day, In paragraph 9 in states, "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emorion. moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions , but also may even help produce them."" So if a student is not feeling well or is sad they won't learn as well. So the computer will sense then and give them a break or an activity that they like to do and their mood will increase. They will learn better because of it.

The Facial Action Coding system is valuable for students. The first reason reason is that we can see how diffrent people felt in diffrent important events. Secondly is that the computer can change up the learning method if they see that the student is getting bored with the way they are currently learning.

But can a computer compet against the human mind? After many of learning/performing the same task that a computer can do to figure human emotions and such? I think not!

First thing, I'll like to point that yes, Dr. Huang created a computer software to,""Precisely enough to convey specific emotions."", but you gotta think, computer can mess up. Emotion's can not only be indicated my facial expression, but also tone of the individual. Plus, is it really a big deal to spend money to figure out different peoples emtion when we can simple just look at them, and say, ""Hey!

He/She looks quite upset."".

Secondly, I'll like to point out that, what the hassle to make a program, when a normal ""Home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode"" emotions. This can even done even better by just looking at a mirror and just copying down their exact facial expression to figure out how they were feeling, and wasting time to encode and create a software to see different types of emotions that could possible fail at doing.

I'm not saying that computer shouldn't be able to perform task humans do always, like there are time where this can sorta useful. For example from the text,""Make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games... communications."" having some benefits.

Using this type of technology to read emotional expressions in a classroom filled with students shouldn't be valuable.

Yes the Facial Action Coding System is helpful with identifying exactly how your feeling, but why in a classroom filled with students? Having computers know exactly how they're feeling isn't something that students

would be able to be

comfortable with. If someone isn't happy, the computers shouldn't have to be programmed to go out of its

way to help a

want to be helped.

muscles in a model that move just like a humans face to identify facial expressions. With that kind technology with the

to

the students. Students like to to keep to themselves, keeping

their

emotions private. Paraghraph 5 It states that humans can also read eachothers facial expressions. Why let a computer find out what your feeling when humans can do the same thing? Also in paragraph 7 it shows steps on how to encode different emotions, the students don't even need

However, in the clasroom is where it will prove to be a great benefit. The technology can give students help when needed and provide a more interesting learning experience. I will show you how the Facial Action Coding System can accomplish all of this. This systems holds lots of value and should be used in classrooms as soon as possible.

First, lets discuss all the help it will give to confused students. Students often find themselves confused when given new or challenging material. So, with a device like the Facial Action Coding System it can help those students. This will eliminate the miscommunication, time wasted, and even embrassement from the student. Also, students can fake their emotions to the teacher and act like they understand. The system will know this and give him or her some help. Dr. Huang claims, ""Most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This proves why the system will hold great value.

Now, I want to talk about the interesting learning experience. During the school day students can become bored and unmotivated.This is regular human behavior that we all go through. However, with this system we can make their lessons more intruiging. This will make students more interested in learning the material. Dr. Huang predicted, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This all sounds too good to be true and people just might argue against it. They might claim that lessons should not be adapted to the student. Rather, students should adapt around the lesson and learn how to complete these challenges in their work. I think that adults in our society dont seem to have been impacted from that way of teaching. It would be much better if the lessons could be slowly training the students. If we give them hard material then some may not do it and that will start a long slope to failure.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be very valuable in the classroom. There is no reason to not have this great technology. Why have confused and bored students? We can easily fix this problem by introducing this Facial Action Coding System. Day by day the technology will learn more about student's world.

21a4446,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to read human emotions has recently been invented. It works by recreating the human muscular motions in the face that are characteristic of certain emotions. Although this technology that allows computers to read emotions may seem irrelevent, ultimately the technology could potentially improve the way that students learn, and help students with social problems that they may have in school.

To begin, the Facial Action Coding technology can be used to tell whether or not a student is understanding a topic. According to Dr. Huang, a professor of the Beckaman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..."" (6). This would allow the instructor to alter the way that they teach the topic to better convey the message. This can also be used when a student needs some kind of stimulation to be able to focus in class. The author Nick D'Alto also states that the ""software can also identify mixed emotions"" (4). This would allow the teachers to see the students who are stressed and confused and those who are happy and excited. When a student is confused or stressed, the teacher can provide additional practice or tutoring in that subject. The information that a teacher can recieve from the software in very valuable. Humans can read emotions to a certain extent, but some people are good at hiding how they really feel and this can be detrimental to their education. Dr. Huang states "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (6). By enabling teachers to use the technology, they can offer assistance to a student who may not ask for it otherwise.

In addition, students can bennefit from this technology in the social environment. According to Dr. Huang ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (4). This means that if a student were getting bullied but they were hiding it, the teachers could find out the information quickly and help the student figure out what is going on. When a student is identified as being sad or depressed, the computer coud show funny pictures to help the student feel better. In fact, ""according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (9). This means that by smiling, the students will actually make themselves feel better.

Overall, the use of Facial Action Coding technology is very benneficial. Whether it be from a strictly educational standpoint, or from the social envirionment side, the results are in favor of improving the school experience of students.                 ",5,7,0.8820458054542542

First of all, the Facial Action coding system would be valuable in a classroom today because, it would make the lesson we do on the computer more intresting. What this means is that insead of a teacher just giving out a lesson that half the class wont even like, the Facial Action Coding system would elinonate that because it get our emotions and give each indiviual person a lesson that fits them the best.""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.

Ok, if someone took a picture and put it on facebook or something you wouldnt know how there felling you would just know what they wanted you to feel. Just because someone is smiling that doesnt mean they are happy, it just means they are smiling, but with the Facial Action Coding System we would know how the person is actualy felling

Though, technology like the Facial Action Coding System is extremely advanced, and could have a major positive affect. Not only could it have a major positive affect on today's society, but it could also have a positive affect on future generations. I believe that the Facail Action Coding System could be very valuable; if it is used for the right reasons. The Facial Action Coding System could help solve many problems in today's society. It could help the law, it could help teachers form better teaching methods, and it can be used for medical purposes.

The law has trouble with telling when someone is lying or even when they are telling the truth. I believe that the Facial Action Coding System could help solve this problem. Acorrding to the paragraph, the Facial Action Coding System can calculate the percent of the certain facial expressions that you are making. Which we all know that when most people lie, they make a certain facial expression or they act a certain way. If police and judges were able to use this sofwear they would be able to tell when someone is liying, and when someone is telling the truth. They could use the Facail Action Coding System as a lie detector. Doing this could help reduce crime rate, and it could help lock away people that deserve to be put in jail rather than innocent people.

Not only could the Facial Action Coding System help the law, but it could also help in schools. According to the paragraph, it can notify teachers when students are becoming bored of what is being taught. By the teachers being notified that their way of teaching isn't helping the students learn, they would know to change that teaching habit. By the teachers changing their teaching habits and making it more interesting, students would be more likely to learn the information that they are recieving. Rather than just being bored, sleeping, and waiting for the bell to ring. With teachers changing the way that they infrom students, students will recieve better grades. Therefore, the Facial Action Coding System, could help make the students better informed, and no longer just bored of the subject that they are being taught.

Most importantly, the Facail Action Coding System can help with medical conditions. There are many mental medical conditions, but suicide is one of the largest mental conditions. No one really knows that someone is planning to commit this action because they do not notice the signs. I believe that if we were to use the Facial Action Coding System we could detect things like this faster, and do something about it before something tragic happens. Yes, we humans are able to detect when someone is feeling bad, but we are not always able to tell whether or not someone is faking their happiness. According to the paragraph, the Facial Action Coding System can detect when someone is faking a smile. With the Facial Action Coding System being able to detect this it would enable us to know if someone is truly feeling down. The Facial Action Coding System could help reduce the rate of Suicides in todays society, and even in future generations.

Even though the Facial Action Coding System may not be able to help with everything. It could be the solution to many big problems in todays society. It could help with some of the worlds biggest problems. The Facial Action Coding system could help the law reduce crime rate, give students a better education, and it could help with medical conditions. Altogether, the Facial Action Coding System could be very helpful. It could be the key to many important things, and it can help future generations become smarter and safer.

22312c6,"This article talks about an image being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. A new software ha sbeen develloped that improves accuracy in perciving the emotions of others. this new software, the Facial Action Coding Syste, has promising applications for variety of industries.

This technology can recognize emotions like the Leonardos da Vinci's renissance painting, Mona Lisa, she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe. The process beings when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model

of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions, happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. The facial expressionsfor each empotion are universal. By weighting the different units, the softwere can even identify mixed emotions. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For intance, you can problably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of, course most of us woulld have trouble actually describing each facial tarit. While it shows just how much this computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. Acordinng to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.

In conclusion I think that this new technology would be beneficient for the people because it would help to know better the people. Also to know about those muscular action units. ",1,7,0.8449470400810242
224e7d7,"I personally think it a waste of technology. As the author mentioned ""You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" and thats true, we can tell by the looks on they're faces. I think technology already has taken over so much in our daily lives. I dont think we need technology to determine what the people close to us feels. I think this technology is a waste because we humans can already tell how someone is feeling, as long as we pay attention. The article mentions the difference of faking a smile, and sincerly smiling, i don't think we need a technology to tell us weather it's fake or not. Also as it says in the article ""your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile"". Our home computers cant be used for this, so whats the point?

I think it is very impressive how the technology can tell the percentages of the emotions. Thats something we humans cannot do. Human can read one emotion, and that emotion would be the highest percentage of that person's emotion. The article mentions that scientists are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. It is definitly impressive but i also think it's useless and a waste.

Why do humans, and computers have to communicate? On paragraph (2) it asks if we can actually calculate human emotions like math homework. I dont think we should be able to, human emotions shouldnt be calculated like math questions.

My opinion on this artical is that this technology is useless and awaste of time. I think the world needs to focus on reconnecting, instead of building robots that can read your loved one's expression, as if you can't. It also can not be activated on your home PC. What if the technology malfuntions? technologys can't be relied on forever. I dont think this technology is valuable.    ",3,7,0.7722251415252686
228188e,"Mona lisa was a famous painting, but now some people are trying to make a software to be able to detect exactly their emotions. The new software is the Facial Action Coding System. This new technology is a good way to see want people are actually feeling and why. They peoperson who created and help think of this marvulous idea told us some great ideas/ things about this new facial emotions thing. One thing is that this thing make a 3-D model on a computer of the face and see the details and muscles in the face which helps determinds a mood. Movement of one of the muscles is call action unit.

There has been studies that says there are 6 emotions that are universal.

The FACS

uses the tecnology to measure the units is a person or painting face to determind the emotions.

In conclusion this essays shows people how this FACS works and what good it will bring with it. This also shows us how technology is getting more advance and smarter. I would say it a good thing for all of us and its a positive outlook on things.",2,7,0.8601159453392029
2289ad8,"In the article provided called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes to us how there is new technology being developed that can identify human emotions. This technolofy called the Facial Action Coding System, like us will be able to make the same ""calculation' we do to tell if our friends are happy, sad mad, etc. Now this computer software stores anatomical informationn as if it were a electronic code. Many have thought that since this technonology enables computers to read human emotions; why not put it in a classroom setting where it can teach a whole group instuction and modify the lesson once theres a sign of confussion in a child's facial expression. I personally beleive that this software should be included in clasrooms for various reasons.

For starters the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable for the classroom setting because like I stated before if there is even a slight sign of confusion the new technology will be able to pick it up and improve to find a way for the student to coprehend the material. While the system uses video imagery the emotion-recognition software tracks all these facial movements in a real time face or in any image. Just imagine a computer being able to tell when you smile at a lesson plan because it's easy to coperhend; futhermore, the system will tr to find similar lessons plans like the one you were sown for next time.Now if you dislike it and frown the computer will take notice and the lesson plan will be diffrent next time.

Another reason we should have the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is because many children in this generation are either to shy to ask questions to the instuctors or just scared that they will e made fun of. SInce the student is to scared or just simply to shy to ask a question he or she will not be able to understand the topic; however, with the system in the computer the student wouldnt even need to raise their hand in doubt because the technology already detected his or her confussion and is finding a solution as soon as possible.

Last but not least most human communication is nonverbal, dont you agree? I think its time for computers to understand that to. Since the computer can detect emotions without hearing anything spoken it will be able to detect if the students are happy with the lesson plan, confused with it, or just not like it. All with one look at the students faces. This hencing adapting and improving more quickly so students can learn the material and suceed.

So can you imagine not having those long boring talks teachers give or actually understanding what they are trying to get you to comperhend? All your classroom problem will be solved with the Facial Action Coding System which will help you learn much faster and efficently; therefor, setting you on the path to sucesses.",4,7,0.8640187382698059
22a129c,"A Facial Action Coding system sounds like something that would be invented or created in the far future. So if there is a real such thing as a facial action coding system it seems that there aren't many negatives as to why it shouldn't be used in a classroom setting today. The Facial Action Coding System should be used in the classroom setting because it will show students understandment, interest level, and overall thoughts over a topic or subject. Also another plus is it could show students themselves something they may be interested in which they didn't know even themselves.

So imagine a class where there is a Facial Action Coding System on a computer for each student to use, there would be so many benefits to using something like this, it sounds perfect for a classroom setting. First of all, it would show teachers the understandment level of students to a certain topic or subject, so if there is a subject or topic in which kids faces were scanned for their feelings about that subject, the teacher could maybe improve or make the lesson easier for students, which overall would create a better education system for the sutudents in the class and better oppurtunity. The second reason as to why it would be valuable to have the facial action coding system int he classroom would be because it would show students and teachers levels of interest kids may have on a certain subject or topic. For example say there are kids in a class and they begin there science notes or studies etc., and some kids have more higher interest feelings than others on the topic, that can show both teachers and even students what they truly feel about science, and it can lead to helping kids making bigger decisions in their lives, such as whether or not they want to pursue a career with lots of science involved or not. The third reason to use facial action coding system would be because it is universal. From the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is said that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" The facial expressions for each emotion being universal means that anyone from anywhere around the world can use this as a tool to help them succeed in school, no matter what ethnicity they are from, and if they look different. Also if this facial action coding system is universal, imagine how accurate it is. So it definetely would be valuable to classroom setitngs all around the world, and would creat greater oppurtunites for students to get a better education.

To conclude, the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to a classroom setting because it shows understandment, shows interest, and is universal which could also mean it is extremely accurate and enhanced. The Facial Action Coding system has many benefits to it which would be a great help to teachers in a classroom as well. The Facial Action Coding System could be used as a tool to succeed to many around the world. And so overall, the Facial Action Coding System is great and would be extremely valuable to classroom settings. ",4,7,0.7719262838363647
22a5954,"people's emotions are diificult to understand, they can say one thing and mean another. you may seem happy when you are trying to hide your sad thoughts or you can seem sad when, in reality, your actually quite scared. it is impossible for a computer to be able to understand emotions when there are such a variety of them that come in many different shapes and forms. a computer might just misread an emotion and claim it as something else the main emotions are happiness and sadness, these to emotions can make up any other emotion including fear, surprise, disgust, and anger. you can become scared of going on a date with your significant other, which you are really excited about, or you can be scared of someone who has done a lot of harm in your life. on paragraph 3 it says that Dr. Pual Eckman,"" classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness,"" however all emotions are made up of happiness and sadness, fear can be classified as either happiness or sadness and the same goes for the other emotions some people can seem happy, however, unless you know them very well and realize that they are doing something different then they normally do, it can go un-noticed, even for a computer that read facial expressions. on paragaph 5 it meantions that humans perform these calculations on a daily basis and that Dr. Huang's ""new computer software stores simular information."" it is physically impossible for a computer to know every emotion especially since people express their emotions in different ways then the rest. sometimes only a close friend or relative can understand what someone is feeling even though they look happy to everyone else.

very few people want their emotions to be documented on a computer where someone can read them off of. in order for a computer to understand emotions, the emotions and facial expressions for a specific emotion need to be documented. that would make it easy for a hacker to hack into your computer and figure out what emotions you express to certain things. on paragraph 6 the article says,"" imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a simular ad might follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different."" not only will hackers figure out what emoitions you express to certain things, they can also figure out what you like/dislike or what emotions you express when texting someone.

Even though kids would not like it it should be brought to use because there can't be anymore drepression into kids life.

First reason why I think we should use technology like this is because it says that, ""even though individuals often shwo varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly."" This means that if we start using this type of technology we can figure out if a person is good or bad. Another reason why we should use this technology is because it says, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait taht conveys happy, worried, etc."" This could mean that even if you might know what they feel you could most possilbe be wrong because if they look happy that does not mean they are actually happy they could be sad in the inside of their body. Then finally my last reason is they used the Mona Lisa smile as a demonstration. Then it said, ""The Mona Lisa demonstartion is really intended to bring a smile to your face... Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" This means this technology can detect if you are actually happy or sad.

22eb6fa,"With the new Facial Action Coding System (FACS), scientists can now make computers to read and interpret human emotions revealed through facial expressions. One of the applications is using the technology in classrooms to analyze the facial expressions of the students during classes. Personally, I do not approve the value of applying this technology in classrooms to read students' emotions.

First, the FACS technology is a brand new technology with a lot of space for development. It is highly effective and useful in many different areas. For example, historians can use the technology to interpret the emotions of historical figures on paintings and photos. Psychologists can use this technology to aid understanding and analyzing the emotions of patients in order to reselove the emotional issues. The technology may be applied in law enforcement as well by analyzing the emotions of criminals and enemies to obtain useful inteligence. Also, as the article mentioned, FACS has a bright future in animation and video editing. With all the potential developments of FACS, using the technology just to analyze the students in schools to know if they're interested and engaging during classes seems like a waste of the asset. A good teacher is well aware of the students in the class. Teachers know if a student is interested. They can either catch the students' attention or teach without people paying attention. It would cost a great amount of money to apply FACS in all the schools. Instead of spending the money on the technology, it would be better to use the money on teachers' training programs and improving teaching regulations to make sure the courses taken by the students are benefitial and interesting, so the classes are more likely to attract students' attention. This is a far more effective method to resolve the issue than spending a lot of money and applying the technology on students who tend not to pay attention in classes. The main focus of the development of FACS should be on other areas which bring more benefits and possibilities to the future.

Secondly, it would be considered as privacy invasion to apply the FACS technology in a public location, like schools. Personal emotions are definately considered as personal privacy. People do not have the rights to spy on other people's emotions, especially when they keep their emotions to themselves. The FACS technology should not be applied in a way which gathering people's emotions by reading the facial expressions without permission. If it is being used in schools, it surely will be a mendatory requirement because students do not have more control over teachers. Emotions are one of the unique qualities owned by humans as a very advanced form of life. The creators of the FACS technology are supposed to understand the point and respect normal human emotions in daily life. In addition, the use of FACS in schools is relatively not applicable. Firstly, it requires a large amount of funds to apply the technology. Secondly, teenagers in high school are going through a stage of life where they are unstable emotionally and value their privacy greatly. There is no doubt that the teenage students would strongly oppose the idea of using FACS technology in the classrooms and observing their emotions all the time.

In conclusion, it is not of enough value to use the Facial Action Coding System to identify students' emotions in a classroom. Based on the two reasons previously mentioned, the effective way would be ensuring the students are interested and attracted by the classes, rather than finding out whether they're are paying attention. And, it is socially unacceptable and not applicable to apply the technology on students. Therefore, instead of spending the money and time monitoring on students' emotions, why not developing the FACS technology for other more influential and benefitial potentials?

But your mind is your own personal business, you only show it sometimes when you want to or sometimes when it's so strong you just have to show it.

In my opinion a computer should not be programmed into looking on the outside not knowing whats on the inside. The saying is,""It's not whats on the outside it's what's on the inside."" But a computer has no emotion, just what the programer programed the computer to do. A computer can't read someones smile even though they are depressed. That happens to me all the time. I talk to my friends with a smile, but when I'm talking

about the same stuff to my therapist my face is a little different because I can't express my opinion very well to my friends.

In the article it says that each expression that the computer recieves is compared to a neutral face meaning no emotion. Humans always have an expression on there face therefore they always have somekind of emotion on there face. The nuetral face problably looks like someone being angry or sad or possibly confused. The computer doesn't know what a sarcasitic smile looks like or someone who is truely smiling but there mouth is frauwning so then the computer will see sadness.

In the article it also states that human communication is mostly nonverbal, including emotional Dr Huang said computers need to understand that too. Frankly I think that is insane, thinking that computers need to know our emotions! Computers are just a tool for knowlege, well some our, and some are just to make you be in a virtual world. No. Live in the now, don't go to your computer, show it your face and have it tell you how your feeling. Just listening to your little voice inside your head, listen to that and feel from that. Everyone has emotions so don't be afriad to show it to PEOPLE NOT ROBOTS! Enough said on that.

The article does state that putting on a happy face actualy works, I do believe that. I have read articles relating to that. I have tried putting on a happy face when I was sad and it kinda worked for me but I can't get happy that easy, but I know it probably works for a lot of people. ""Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!""

That statement, in my opinion, doesn't really need to be said because showing your emotions and facial expressions is something that every human has and science doesn't really need to be improved for the facial expression.

An article called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" goes in depth about how the system works and what it does for society. Basically, this system shows you exactly what a face is feeling emotionally. I think this is a great idea and a step into the technology of the future.

One reason why this system is great is it can show you exactly what emotions someone has. The system constructs a 3-D model of the face on the computer. It then compares the face to a face that is showing no emotion. The system then looks at your 44 muscles in your face to see how you are feeling. The system can even detect mixed emotions. Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois is the creator of this system and he says this about the system, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face."" Dr. Huang is explaining that this system can even detect if you are feeling multiple emotions by weighing different units.

Another thing the Facial Action Coding System can do is recognize faces from paintings. The most recent piece of art they have studied for emotions was the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. After the process, they discovered that the Mona Lisa is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Gettng these results can now tell us what painters from a long time ago were thinking about in there art when they painted it. This can be very useful in figuring out more ideas from artists in the rennisance age.

The FACS technology would help kids understand better by reading their emotions and telling what they understand and what they don't. The technology is capable of reading human facial expressions and giving the verdict on what they are feeling. Say for example a kid in a class has no clue what is going on in the subject, the FACS system can read his/her emotions and change the course to be a little more understandable for them. It can also help by seeing if the anyone is feeling sad or depressed and they can help that person.

Although this technology sounds great and seems like it has no flaws or problems, it does. The system may become a distraction to the children by them knowing about it and continuing to think about it. The FACS system may also mess up and read the wrong emotions on someone and send the wrong information to whoever runs the system. It is not said how long of a process that it takes just to figure out one persons emotions. Having the system would be better than nothing though.

People would say that when they are or were in school that they were had some type of emotion about the lesson that htey were going to learn. ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confude or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts"" (paragraph 6). This computer could help the students learn and teachers could help the students better if they are unexcited, bored, or even confused. When a teach knows that a student(s) are bored or confused with a lesson they try to change it to where the students won't be. ""'Then it [the computer] could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (paragraph 6).

With the Facial Action Coding System the teacher would really have to do much and figure out how to change the whole lesson but still have the same content and have it in the same time length as planned.

To help students understand in the classroom the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable by reading the students expressions. Citizens who go or went to school would agree that this computer could help and even Dr. Huang said that it could help students. It could also help teachers by not taking up there time so they could get other stuff done, like grading paper and looking at other lessons.",3,7,0.8367336392402649
24ae08e,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the Facial Actions Coding Systems symbolizes a change in technology.

I think this could change our country because it will open our eyes up a bit for the kids sake. This could help us in many ways. Eckman has cassified six basic emtions- happiness, surprise, anger,disgust, fear,and sadness are all very important for children and adults.

The article says "" In fact, we humans peform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" I completely agree with all of this because it so true. Everyon eknows that they use this in every day life and you probably don't even know it either. I use it his at school every day because I care for the people around me.

This could show who in the classroom is depressed and could help our world be a better place. by the new technology using this, it could save lives by suicide. I'm saying this because our world had become dark with all of this. we need more help.

The Article says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts

and then it could modify the lesson, likean effective human instructor"". This could be huge for the schools we send our children too. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. So what he is getting at is computers are going to have to start to understand that

and i completely agree with him.

In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the Facial Actions Coding symbolizes a change in technolgy and I agree that we should do this for our children. We need to do this cause it will change our ways of how we learn forever. The computer will not misread peoples faces and

if they ever get bored of the lesson he/she is learning. Then, the computer will regonize it and make the lesson funner and will benifit the kids much more than what they are doing now for us. ",3,7,0.8564901351928711

Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This Technology is suppose to detect anyones emotions at that time by using a 3-D model of a face and detects it by the 44 major muscles must move like human muscles.

I believe this could be a good use for in the future for students in school who deals with depression and anxiety and doesn't show it. Some students probably wont't like the idea of a computer telling how you're really feeling because like some they probably doesn't like to show any emotions but this technology could help a lot of students out dealing with their emotions.

It would be just like us telling a friend how are they feelings just like in the article its says For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelin simply by the look on her face"".

We all need just a reminder to smile every once and a while just like in the article it also says helps the muscles and helps preduce them.

Overall, i think this technology could be very usefull not only to just express feelings but also for students, adults, anyone who deals with their emotions to helps them. Make them feel happy and be able to show their emotions intead of keeping it inside of them. ",2,7,0.8752709627151489

This technology could really help because then they can tell if someone is really unhappy. Most people do not want other people to know what they are feeling but it helps people around you. This technology can tell you like what percent happy you are or digusted or fearful or angry. Like Mona Lisa's percentages were 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 2 percent angry. With people being able to know how people in paintings were feeling you can put together what might be happening or what they are trying to point out.

This technology is actually very helpful because they can tell everything by just using a computer and using it on a painting to see what their emotions are. The computers can detect all 44 muscles in someone face. All the muscles have to move like human muscles. They say in the article that the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. The Eckman has classified six basic emotions and those emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. An example they used by telling any of those is your frontalis pars laterials muscle which is above you eyes raises you eyebrows when you are surprised. A way they can tell that you are angery is when your orbicularis oris which are around your mouth tightens your lips.

There are many different things that this technology can tell about you which could really help because it could let people around you know how you are feeling instead of having to answer and you just say your fine. Like you can kind of tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. Everyone can have trouble describing like the reasons why they feel like that but atleast you can tell how they are feeling. Even if you do not know why they are feeling that way you can try and change how they are feeling. Like most people do not want to have to explain why they feel that way they just want a friend to be there for them and help you boost your mood. Computers are unstanding what peoples emotions are but they are still trying to figure out how to nonverbal communicate with someone.

The article gives you instructions to do while looking in the mirror. The first instruction is to raise your lips at the corners of your mouth, the next one is to then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, the last one is holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes. They ask if you express in the mirror suggest an emotion and it does it is a happy emotion. Experts can even tell by just looking at a celebrity and they can tell if the are being truthful about being happy or if the are sad.

This technology could help many people. Do you just sit there sometimes and think what are they feeling or are they sad or happy well now you can tell by just doing some very easy things. Like you can use a computer that can recognize what you are feeling even if you are just sitting there doing something the computer can still tell. You can even learn ways to just look at someones face and can tell how they are feeling by just the muscles on their face. This can help friends they will be able to tell how their best friend is feeling and they can try and change their mood. Even if it does not seem helpful it really is, by just telling what someones emotions is by just looking at them can actually change a lot of things.",3,7,0.8400311470031738

I believe that the technology used can be important in schools and classrooms to show wether students are bored, sad, or angry. This technology can be used to help students with different emotions learn lessons better. The technology can also help teachers further understand how a student's emotions affects their learning.

When the program gets implemented into schools it may actually help students learn better. In the text it is explained that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", meaning that it can be used on almost any one. This would make it easier to use the program in other areas and different kinds of people.

But wait, now a computer system can detect emotions. The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, after all, faces don't lie. We can look at paintings to see how characters, like the Mona Lisa, felt when being painted by artists, create empathy, and identify how someone really feels. Humans are emotional beings but we have a hard time identifying emotions, maybe technology can help.

Technology, espacially the FACS, that can identify others' emotions using facial expressions, can lead to discoverable understandings. The FACS could make it possible to interpret emotions of people who were being painted at the time. According to the passage, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much much this computer can do"". Creating empathy could be possible after moving face muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them, which is what FACA is going to use to indicate emotion. According to the passage, "" Constantin Stanisskavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage, as a result, Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions"". Detecting emotions in places where emotions are often expressed at different times, such as schools. According to the Dr. Huang's prediction, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Humans may not be able to tell someone's emotions, but if a computer does, then we'll be able to have a greater understanding of one's emotions and how to predict them.

Humans aren't computers, we don't know how to use emotions or analyze them in daily life. With the invention of FACA, analyzing emotion in someone or something can be put to good use. Emotions can go a long way; from being able to predict emotion to how to use them. From expression to analysis, emotions will always change as we change the future.",3,7,0.8471903800964355

The authrs describles how new technology enables to identify human emotion in life.

Human expression is how your show your emotions to your friends, family, teachers. People express their emotions in many ways. Here is an example, Mona Lisa she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry most of the time. that's how she expressed her emotions.

Dr. Huang did research on peoples emotions and how people showed their emtions in ways, that he did know how people expressed their emtions with how their face looked to see their emotions show. Dr. Huang looked at the painting of Mona Lisa that Da Vinci painted to show Mona Lisa's emotion in the painting to show, how she felt about being in the painting to express how Da Vinci and Mona Lisa both felt the paintg that both of them liked the painting. Da Vinci emotion to paint a picture of Mona Lisa he felt happy, but he also that she was happy about him painting a picture of her being happy, mad.

Everyone that has been to school knows that, not everyhing you learn will be interesting and nor will some of your teachers. By having new teachnology that could change that and make future genarations more involved in their own learning, will be life changing. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.(6) I personaly would like a teacher that knows when I need help or when I know what Im doing. Its even better if they know when we are bored, it could change lots of students mind sets towards public education.

The FACS could help in many ways, one it could be helpful towards actors or just people that want to be more in touch with there emotions. ""According to the Facial Feedback Thoery of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" (9) When you sign up for a class that you have to act in and your grade depends on it, this machine would come real handy. I was in a speech class my first semester of 10th grade. The teacher made us memorize a monolge of a movie character. We had to say word for word while showing emotions, emotions that I had never felt before. With the FACS future students could be better at that class and it can go a long way.

The Facial Action Coding System does help students in the classroom. It would be a whole new genaration of studnets if this machine went out to the schools.

Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Mona Lisa is a Painting that is drawn by the use of color painting and other handful material, when humans are drawing with their hand and feelings it shows the facial expression and emoyion of the drawing. Technology cannot be used to express humans feelins or emotions, even with what is installed in it.

With the use of technology, the facial expression and emotion of Mona Lisa and even other drawing emotions and feelings cannot be expressed because technology has no feelings or emotions, also emtoins cannot be calculated, ""Hold on! Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions-like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"".

Technology cannot express feelings to human, so it cannot be used to calculate human emotional expression.

In conclusion to the use of technology to calculate humans emotional expression. Technology cannot calculate humans expressions because humans emotion and facial expression varies from time to time and based on what there are seeing and feeling at the moment, so technology cannot calculate human expressions.

For example, ""Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" This is not always acurate, all faces are different and it could detect that you are sad even though you are excited or happy.

Yes that is good evidence, but you cannot be sure of the accuracy because again, everyone has a different face and smile.

Emotions also do not come from the face they come from the brain,heart, and on the inside. Not the outside . So if someone seems like they are mad or they look mad,sad,happy, or all of the above, that could just be their face and how they look. How could a computer even calculate how you feel?

I strongly believe that the computer would be helpful in some classrooms but not all, depending on the subject. A facial expression does not always tell a emotion.

This topic is very debatable depending on whom you ask, this would be a controversy to say the least. There are many ways around this ""emotion reading computer"", it only takes a fake smile to surpass this. I do not believe an instructor of a classroom should also worry about what emotion the students may be in, regardless they have to do the work assigned. There are very many opinions in this article which do not pursuade other to buy their product such as when they stated: ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do (D'Alto6).""

Think about this way if you give that to a one person you think they will use it for good I don't think so.

It's not good to use that it's because people are just gonna play with humans feeling so i'm going for not using Facial Action Coding System. People know what your feeling their just gonna make fun of you or mess around with you because they know how you feel. It's justn not safe it's just gonna make people in trouble it't really a bad idea to use it. Knowing how many percent how happy you are based on passage it can detect percentage of your emotions that's nice but it's really bad idea. Based on the passage their talking about how humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday I don't believe that human have different perspective, different point of view.

I would rather not use Facial Action Coding System I don't even think if it's safe or not. It's really not a good idea to use it for humans because you know how they feel based on their actions, movements, expressions, and how they act. No need for that technology knowing a person you can tell how happy they are. Someone you truly know is a best way to know their expression.

Using Facial Action Coding System should be illigal because I people don't want them finding out their feeling. No one wants to know what your feeling you want them to find out because that's how you know if they do care. People got used to people knowing their used to look for their expression they don't need such as facial action system. It's so much better to know a feeling by talking to them in person. I would prefer use my abilities to know a person feeling instead of using that fake technology.

By looking at the picture of Mona Lisa you can that is quite happy you can see that little curve in her face it might seem different for others but looking at her make feel that she's happy.It says on the passage it also can make you happy.

According to the article, the way you physically move your faces helps you detect on how you are feeling. If you look upset or worried it would be easy detect and when someone realize they while try communicating with you. Having to hide emotions and not communicate it is easier to notice in a person.

The software will help recognize your emotions just by looking at your face. For example, in the article it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". It will be helpful to the instructor to have more coefficient lessons for the students. The article also tells you ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". The creator of the software(Dr. Huang) suggest that computers should understand that just like us human do.

Muscles moving physically can really give a clue on how your emotions are at the moment you react. According to the passage when you lift up your eyebrows it shows that you are surprised. Other examples are when you smile to the sideways, you are fake smiling. In the passage, it also indicates that when you see somebodies facial emotion it can make you feel what they feel. Muscles that begin at your cheek bones show that you are giving a real smile.

""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

Another reason why this technology is not valuable is that some people don't want their emotions to be known, they want to keep it to themselves. Finding out someones emotions even though if they don't want it to be known is not something that people would want.

Finaly, it might affect many students relationship. For example if someone finds out about thier friends feeling they might not feel the same way they did before; they might not communicate anymore. Dr. Huang says ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"". Tracking someones emotions even on an image or painting is not fine unless the person on the image or painting is okay with it.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

On the otherhand, the software might not be so great. Throughout the text, the scientists state that the emotions are universal, and that everyone has the same few emotions.

Not everybody's expressions are the same, some may vary, and with only six basic emotions, the machine may not be able to properly read what a person is feeling.

New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of industries.

This new technology can help others in so many ways.

One Reason is a person's emotional state. Suicides are major

problem in our world today. Victims are usually hiding their emotions to avoid being detected for their feelings. This technology can find out their emotions by using a 3-D model of the human face; all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

Another reason FACS is useful is the lovely world of education.

Students go through school lost or angry for not being able to click on to the lesson being teached. This system of technology can tell if a student is confused in a certain or many topics. Many students are builled for saying they need help or they dont understand what is being taught. The teachers can use FACS to look at the students face and see if the student needs to be explained the lesson over in class or privately.

My final reason I support FACS is in the courtroom. When justice needs to be served it comes down to the jury to decide cases such as murder,rape and other criminal actions. Poylographs (detection tests) are the common tool used to determine if the alleged is innocent or guilty. Polyographs are known to fail,causing the innocent behind bars or the guilty running free. FACS can scan the emotions of the alleged to see if they feel empathy or if they are guilty.                                          ",3,7,0.8072844743728638

For school purposes, the FACS can be used to alter an online course, assessment, or even just a simple knowledge check, using facial expressions to determine if the students are confused, bored, or if they understand it. If they are confused, it may be altered to help them understand whatever it is they're working on. For someone who is bored, it may try to make an online course more interesting to grasp their attention.

However, the FACS is not perfect. It may mistake a facial expression for the wrong emotion. This could result in issues involving altering an online assessment, or course. Some students may feign emotions, and make faces to do the easier course that's meant for students who require additional help. Also, students who take an online course may be confused about something else, not the course they're taking. The FACS will still read that expression as confusion and alter it because of that confusion.

It is easy for people to fake a smile or not act sad. Using the technology today, society can figure out whether or not someone is in a good mental state. This technolgoy does not just calculate one eotion, but multiple emotions. It would be a good idea to use this new system of calculating emotions because individuals misinterpertate another person's mood. With using this device humns would have a clear and better understanding of how someone is feeling. ""The Facial Action Coding System"" can help teachers with their job. This device can detect whether a student is bored or understanding the material. If teachers new this, they would find a better way of teaching. The device is 'all about those muscular action movements, they even indiate a difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.""

The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in the classroom because it can tell the differene if omeone is being truthful or not. If a student gets in trouble and chooses not to tell the truth, this device can detect it. The article states ""to an expert, faces don't lie, these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" It's also important to detect students emotions in the classroom. The teachers never know whats going on with a student. For example a student could have a rough home life, that could lead to making bad choices like self harm. It's important to know what a student is feeling so they can get help earlier on. Not only is that a good thing to know, but it's important to see if the student understands the material being taught. If the student is unsure what is going on in the lesson, the teacher needs to find a way to help the student understand. If students are bored or confusedduring the lesson, the teacher needs to modify it. Teachers can do this by making work more hands on and intresting.

In conclusion The Facial Action Coding System is a smart and effective way to indicae someone's emotions and shouls be used more. ",4,7,0.9001986980438232

The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in the classroom because there are students who fake a smile when they're sad or troubled. Some students want help but they don't want to bother people with their problems so they stay quiet and fake a smile. With FACS the teachers and students will be able to tell the student's emotions and they can help the student.

It is also helpful because it can tell when a student is bored. When a student is bored, he/she will most likely not pay attention. But with FACS teachers will be able to tell when the student is bored so they can make learning a little fun. That way students will be able to pay attention and get educated.

Also, FACS can tell when the student is scared. The students might be going through something and they're scared of someone or something but some students don't know how to tell. They could be threatened by someone. FACS will be able to tell when the student is scared so the teachers and students can finally help the student who is scared.

As you can see, the FACA is valuable in classrooms.           ",3,7,0.7219809293746948

The professors Thomas Huang and nicu Sebe who are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communiacte are trying to find that a 3-D computer contructs how we feel. To help the professors Huang relies on a psychologist

Dr. Paul Eckman creates the system. Emotions that could be detected are the six basic emotions that are associated with each characteristic of movements in the facial muscles are happyiness,anger, surprise,disgust,fear, and sadness. All those emotions can make you have you face a certain way. For example when you are really surprised your mouth could drop wide open and your eyebrows could raise. With the new technology using

""video imagery"" tracks the movement of a real or painted face by looking at the different units indentifying mixed emotions. By helping identify Huang observes that da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to clearly state specific emotions. on the computer it stores similar anatomical info as a code (Da Vinci Code). If you were at school and so seem to be bored, confused, or excited and the computers webcam looking at you and it changes what you are doing, or it helps you all by the look on your face. That could help students get engaged into theri school work. For that to work the new technology Huang states that "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, So computers need to understand that, to."" if the computer undersatnds how you feel without taling to it, it could help a lot on how student feel about their assignments.

In conclusion, new technology could have a positive feedback on how student perform on there school work. The professors and the psychologist could be making a great new technology to help the performance of students.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" each section explains the valuable improvements technolody is making; however, one can argue that this new Facial Action Coding Sysytem may not excel in the classroom. This system enables a computer to read the expressions of humans but this may not be as effective as it seems. The author explains that this system could be used in the classroom in order to benefit the students lessons. This may be effictive to some degree; however, the computer system can not understand the students thought process. The Facial Action Coding Sytem would not be as valuable in the classroom in order to read the emotional expressions of students.

The Coding System created by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe is a computer that uses a 3-D model of the face in order to ""claculate"" the expressions and emotions of a human. Prof. Huang and Sebe also collaborated with a psychologist in order to simplify the machine toread and code six basic emotions. These six basic emotions- happiness, fear, surprise, anger, disgust, and sadness- do not cover the overall nature of human expressions. This is already one fault in the idea. Students in any grade level have many different ways of expressing their feelings and emotions whether that be through nonverbal facial recongnition or body movement. The ""basic six"" would not accurately cover each expression portrayed by the user and it could lead to a simple, yet common mix up.

Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" When broken down Dr. Huang is stating that the system could replace a human instructor in order to teach the student based on his or her emotional reaction to the lesson being taught. This is not a valuable asset for stdents who may simply not enjoy the lesson being taught, whether they understand it or not. A common stereotype is that all highschool students are tired, which for the most part is accurate, whcih could confuse the system with the idea that the student is unhappy about the lesson. An honors student may then have the lesson simplified to a point it is no longer of any value to the learner. According to renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, ""Putting on a happy face actually Works!"" This is another reason the system could be easily decieved with false readings of a student. They could simply put on their happy face and a computer attempting to read the emotion of that person would not be ""calculating"" an acutal emotion. This would not benefit the student's learning process nor their social relationships.

Social relationships are a major part throughout school and this system would take a lot of the interaction away from students and teachers. Unable to help students, the social nature in interactions between students and higher authorities would be negative. Dr. Huang notes that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This may be true; however, taking away the interactions and basic knowledge of students manners could be harmful. Even though there are pros to this system, such as video surgery that make computer-animated faces more expressive, there is not a need for the system in an everyday classroom.

Facial Coding in the classroom would not benefit the stuents learning process or social interractions. There are myriads of ways to express emotions nonverbally without facial recognition. Six basic emotions may not accurately decribe the feeling of ones current stae of mind in the classroom, which could affect the lesson given to him or her. Social relatiosnhips could be lost when relying on a machine to determine one anothers feelings and ""putting on happy faces"" may damper ones ability to express their emotions. The Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable to the students in a classroom environment.                ",6,7,0.8668267726898193

The author states that Mona Lisa is "" 83 percent happy, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The algerithym only gave us 91% of the Mona Lisa emotion what about the other 9%? The FACS machine reads your 44 major muscles to read your emotions which is amazing and kind of silly at the same time. This all the machine does but it could be helpful to figure out if someone is really upset about something going on, but it could have some draw backs to it. The FACS machine only read 91% of the Mona Lisa and i want to know the rest of it!

The positive aspect of the machine is that it could read emotions and facial muscles to see if the kid is thinking about suicide if it could do that. The FACS machine ""using video imagery, the new emotion-recognizer software tracks these facial movements."" This shows that FACS is devolping that one day could helps with emotions and other various life problems like helping us recognize friends that are going through a rough patch in their life. These sentences from the text "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actully describing each facial trait the conveys happy, worried etc."" If Dr. Huang devolps the FACS machine more to helps more with friends emotion when feeling down or even our parents if neccesary. This could have a huge impact for students because teachers can with problems in your just by recognizing your facial movements and emotions.

This FACS machine may have some down sides to it because this could be a invadement of personal space, say if some doesn't want to talk and use this machine to do so then you used the machine without that persons permission so this machine as long as it used for people that really need the help i don't think this machine will last much. This text from the passage ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, "" Dr. Huang. "" So computars need to understand that,too.""

27dce02,"The author of this article has some really good points on how the Facial Action Coding System is useful for the students in the classroom. Even though the computers could tell you how another person is feeling you could also do the same with your closest frineds and family because you kmow them so well. The computers have no idea who you are but they still know what emotion you are feeling just by how the bones in your face are working together.

The computer will form a 3-D model of the face. All of the 44 major muscles have to work exactly like the human muscles in the model. They have classified six basic emotions such as: happiness, surprise, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. Most people like to hide their emotions with thier face so people don't know that something is wrong. The computer could see right through that and see exactly what emotion is going on.

In the classroom students that are shy or don't ask for help often lie to their teacher and tell them that they understand exactly whats goingon and exactly what they're doing. If we had those computers in the classrooms then the teachers could help us more by knowing the truth. The teachers could figure out a better way to teach the lesson so the kids are'nt so confused.

These computers could change lives but not many people probably see that since it's just another piece of technology. Imagine using this for someone yu are teaching or explaining something to yoou would want them to learn whatever that is you're helping them with would'nt you? But if that person is scared or shy they wouldn't be so easy to tell you that they don't understand. If we used these computers properly and not just as some toy then we could change how education is taught and it not being so difficult to understand so you could recieve better education quality.

Teachers already try their best to help their students but sometimes it's just more difficult than it seems. Children like to give attitude when not understanding something or when they feel like the teacher is judging them because they don't understand something. When it comes to school and work it's alot of stress and focusing but if teachers had a better way to recognize the emotions of their students it'd be easier for them to help them out instead of leaving them there and not understand anything.

I feel as if teachers would like the idea of having one of these computers in their classroom because not only does it benefit their students but it also benefits them by helping their generation out and not letting their students fail but to become successful. So I think that having these in the classroom would be very valuable and helpful for everyone. ",4,7,0.8799921870231628

As translated through the ideas of Nick D'Alto who believes that using this computer in classroom or school based activities is a great idea. The computer is showing off how computers can crack the surface of 'amazing', but it is merely depriving and shameless.

The analytical images percieved by the computer bring no emotional or true connection between a student and another student. Through the entirety of 'Making Mona Lisa Smile', not once does the author mention anything about how the student would respond to these 'calculations' emotionally in a classroom. D'Alto elaborated by saying ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"", this just explains the ideas of the entire reading. The importance of this is outstanding, if the computer is only looking at number and muscle movements, then how would a student possibly react to looking at people as merely numbers and respondents of action, and not true emotions.

The idea of looking at students and just thinking of there emotions, the thing that makes them human as just numbers is just degrading. The unbareable thought of someone looking at your smile and dissecting it was not covered in the reading, it was seen as numbers for a science class like some small expirement. As said by the author when he asked ""Can we actually 'calculate' emotions-like math homework"", obvioulsy pointing to the fact that yes was the answer. Moreover the fact that exploiting a persons emotions is socially and even scientifically wrong, this demonstrates how the technology is being forced onto people as a tool and not just another 'cool' computer program.

The computer that can sense emotions or just facial expressions is depriving and shameless for a tool that should be used in more appropriate occurances such as a workplace or new photo taking booth at a mall; not a classroom. This could emotionally affect a student and derail their idea of 'emotion'.

Being able to use this technology in classrooms could be such a help for some students. Since now majority of schools use laptops in the classrooms or they go to computer labs to work this could be a help. There are a lot of students that are afraid to ask their teacher for help when they don't understand a probelm that they are working on because they feel embarrassed for not understanding something that most of the class in understanding. Having this technology in class that could read your facial expressions while you are working could be a huge help. The technology could be able to tell if a student is confused, nervous, or any other emotion while he or she is working on the lesson.

Even when someone is trying to pretend to look like another emotion, the technology can still tell how you are feelng.

The process of this technology first begins when the computer creates a 3-D model of a face. This model shows and distinguishes all 44 major facial muscles.

When one or more muscles moves, this is called an ""action unit"". Then Dr. Paul Eckman uses Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to depict which emotion is being presented of the main six.

There are 44 major muscles in the facial part of the human body. Each helping to describe emotion based on which is flexed and in action. These muscles show the six main emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. When a muscle called the frontalis pars lateralis flexes, this causes the eyebrow to raise. This motion shows the emotion of surprise. When the orbicularis flexes, it causes the lips to tighten which shows anger.

With the help of the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving facial muscles does more than just express emotion. It actually produces emotion as well. Using this device in a classroom would be extremely valuable. This device would detect emotion and send the results back to the teacher/ counselor. With this information, the teacher/ counselor could then help the student with their emotional problems if they have any. Especially high-school students with all of the stress and pressure they endure throughout their years. Giving the results back to students may even better their emotion knowing that when someone makes a face of happiness, they actually start to feel it too.

This software could potentially have a range of different uses in the future. However, it will never have true value in evaluating the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

Dr. Paul Eckman helped create this system. He determined that there are six basic emotions on which humans can be evaluated: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In the sixth paragraph, D'Alto explains, "". . . If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""

This is a good example of how the software can be useful. Personalized ads are important for websites to deliver content that the consumer will enjoy. A software that can adapt to the person viewing the ads is beneficial to both the consumer and the website on which the individual is viewing.

Although this software is good for things such as ads, it is not useful in a classroom. Also in the sixth paragraph, D'Alto quotes Dr. Thomas Huang, an expert in human-computer communications, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'""

When the software is used to determine whether or not an ad is pleasing, it is straight forward and easy for the computer to read. Happiness is one of the emotions the software could detect, in addition to disgust, fear, and sadness. For ads, these would be the emotions that would be read to improve content. Confusion and boredom, two of the emotions brought up by Dr. Huang, are not in the six basic emotions a computer could detect. Advertisements on websites are specifically intended to trigger emotions by the viewer, and therefore it is easy to tell if the ad has the intended affect on the consumer. When it comes to school work, emotion is not an important factor of the learning. If an intelligent student is learning the lesson well but looks as if they were confused, this would impare the learning process by modifying the lesson when it is not needed.

Even if the software could tell if the student was bored, it is difficult to tell whether or not they are gathering the information necessary to learn the lesson. The software has good uses and helpful purposes, but not when it comes to regular, dull school work which may or may not result in any emotion at all.",4,7,0.8058578372001648

This passage explains how FACS could help for a lot of different things. For example in the article it says ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" Meaning that if the FACS really does work, it could be used for knowing how teenagers feel about school and learning. Teenagers now an days think school is boring. Sometimes teachers don't even know when their students are paying attention. If schools had emotion-recognition software we would be able to know if our students are into the lessons.

The FACS could help teachers understand how their students may feel. In paragraph 6 it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" In my opinion i think it is true, having a emotion-recognition software could really help teachers. Some kids are to nervous to ask the teacher to repeat the lesson, kids get confused easily, having a FACS could really help. It could let you know if your student is confused or bored. This could really change the way of teaching, some teachers don't even pay attention to their students.

Having a emotion-recognition software could really help all around the world. The creator tested the new software on the Mona Lisa painting. The results were incredible. He says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" It also says ""It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, the same technology can make computers animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery."" Having this software could really help people understand how others feel. This proves how technology could be very useful, this new generation is going to change the world, and so is this new FACS software.

Dr. Huang created the FACS to underdstand human facial expressions. I say that in my own words having a emtion-recognition software could really help people. Sometimes teenagers hide their emotions and put on a fake smile or pretend to be happy when they are not. Teenagers now an days don't really like showing their emotions because in their mind they think it makes them seem weak. Sometimes teenagers don't want to talk about what is wrong, and sometimes teachers/parents don't even know what to do. That technology could really change the world. In paragragh 6 Dr. Huang notes ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that, too."" That is true.

29a0567,"Would you like someone to be able to read your emotions? Reading someone's emotions ican help you know that they need some help. Here are some reasons why it is good to be able to read emotions.

Reading the emotions of someone is amazing and should be used. In the article, Dr. Huang stated, ""The facial expresions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varing degrees of expression."" This shows why it is important to know how people feel when they are being taught something they don't understand.

Reading a person's emotions can be complicated when you're with a friend. The article states, "" She's (The Mona Lisa) 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This says that when The Mona Lisa was painted, she had 4 different emotions. When your with friends, it is unclear how they feel.

This research shows why it is necesary to read the emotions of somebody to know how they feel. This face reading software can help people who need help but can't tell others how they feel. Using software to read friends emotions can show you when they need your help.",3,7,0.7284411191940308
29a6e58,"Technology rapidly advancing and has many benefits. These benefits can be seen anywhere but especially in classrooms, as schools are always looking to innovate in new ways to make their students smarter, more comfortable, and learn more overall in class. One of these technologies is the Facial Action Coding System or F.A.C.S which allows computers to identify human emotions, this technology would be very valuable to students and their learning experience.

There is lots of value in adding this to the learning experience. For example a computer could adjust the lesson by seeing the look on your face. It can do this since the F.A.C.S. system can quantify the muscles behind human emotion giving an accurate representation of what the person is feeling. If a student is happy with the lesson the system could be used to shorten this lesson since the student likely already knows it and if the student is confused or disgusted by the lesson the program can continue it till they are satisfied with their skills in it and have learned what is neccessary.

There are some cons to the F.A.C.S system right now though. First, the F.A.C.S system is expensive and requires a super powerful computer to use. Second, A student may be satisfied even when not knowing a lesson. Third. the F.A.C.S system could be incorrect in some aspects as it does not have as wide a range of emotions as we feel.

However even though it is flawed these flaws can be fixed. It is likely in the future that the cost of the F.A.C.S system go down as things like telephones and computers have done. It is also very likely that the accuracy of the F.A.C.S system goes up as time goes on things like the cellphone and television we're very primitive concepts at the beggining of their life but have advanced and flourished since then. So the flaws of the F.A.C.S system in schools are minor compared to the benefits.

The Facial Action Coding System is truly changing the game when it comes to technology. Soon, it could change the education field as well. This could cause a revolution in education make it easier for students to learn and easier for them to excel if done right, which hopefully it will be.",4,7,0.8785374164581299

But what if that person really isnt that emotion? Many people can just fake being happy by smiling or they can act like their sad just by putting on a fake face. You can only truely know how they are really feeling by the way they act, or if you know this person very well. Why let a computer tell you that your sibling or somebody is actually moderatlely happy when they may be really depressed but doesnt want to show it. Instead of the computer scanning faces, why not have something that takes time to observe the way people act and feel. Theres no guarantee that Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy. What if she was just smiling for the painting? Theres no way a computer can solve peoples emotions like that. It would take way more work and progress to accuratly see how a person feels. And until something of the sort is designed, we should stick to the people who help with the people having problems with emotions and can tell whats wrong with them, like therapists or in some cases doctors. Anyone can just say theyre happy, and all they have to do is smile. Thats all it takes to fool an expensive computer thats honestly worthless.

29cf025,"Why would we need technology to tell us someones emotions when we know ourselves? No, I don't think that this is valuable because it is basically a machine that does an action that we can do ourselves. It also may not even be as acurate as scientist beleive. Another reason why I beleive that this invention isn't valuable is because I just find it really scary how exact the numbers are that the machine gives even if the numbers aren't correct and how much of interaction is happening between the face and the software.

The first reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because we don't need a machine to do the job of reading expressions for us when we can do it just fine by ourselves. I know this because in the article they state,"" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday."" This shows that we can indeed read emotions of people all by ourselves. I also know this because the text states,"" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This statement is completely true, I know that I can tell when people are upset even if they aren't my friends or someone that I know. Finally, I know this because the text states,"" Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" This is true to a point because we may not be able to know when someone is feeling worried or frustrated but we know that something is wrong. That is not a bad thing when we don't know every expression on somoenes face becasue that gives us social experiences with other people to go and ask them what's wrong.

The second reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because scientists may beleive that this technology is accurate but is it really? I know this because in the text it states,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This right here shows that if the muscles of the face aren't showing enough muscle for an emotion the software might pick up a different emotion. I also know this because the text states that, ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle(above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbiculars oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" I disagree with how they are training this software to recognize facial emotion because some people don't make a happy face when they are happy or a sad face when they are sad.

The last reason that I beleive that this software isn't valuable is because it is really creepy on how exact the number can get and how much interaction there is between the computer and the face. I know this because the text states,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Wow, to me that is scary. I would never want this software to read my facial expressions. I also know this because the text states, "" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" Why would people want computers to take over little everyday things that we do? This is creepy how much computers have weasled their way into our everyday lives so easily.

In conclusion, I beleive that this software isn't valuable because why would we use a machine to do something that we can do by ourselves? Also because the information being received from the software may not even be accurate. Finally, because the software is just really creepy and scary to think about how much human and machine interaction happens daily and how much much we rely on them.     ",5,7,0.7597262263298035

The usage of the Facial Action Coding System in schools to determine if a student is getting bored, tired, or angry at a lesson could be very useful. If a student were to get angry or bored during a lesson they are more likely to not pay attention and if you are tired you may not retain the information as well. If your computer could sense this and alert the teacher or change the lesson accordingly then it would give students a better working enviroment and a better chance of doing well in school. This 3D construct could also help teacher's understand their students better and help them learn more efficiently.

This is a really cool thing cause now we can see and know when someone is actually happy or not. We could have so much more uses for this then trying to guess what emotions someone is feeling.

I think that this type of technology is actually very useful, my reasons for that come from the article when the author tells about how using a special camera can detect when someone is becoming bored when doing homeowrk or doing someother type of school work on the computer. If you can tell when comeone is confused or bored then you could really get some help or get a better, more fun filled math questions. Than would make students more productive and want to actually learn rather then when you are bored and doing ISTEP, they can make the test more exciting.

But there could also be some down fall to it. When a computer is watching your while your on it then that could be really weird feeling for some people. Also when a computer is seeing your facial expression all the time you could just be talking to someone and the computer would think your not getting what ever your doing so then it would have a tutor come up when you dont even need one.

So in my conclusion I think that these emotion reading computer cameras could not be so good but in other cases could be really handy or even in some events save you from getting a bad grade on a test.

2af44aa,"The Debate of the Faces

A new technology called Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to show human emotions by facial expressions, is not valuable to students in the classroom. I do not think that a computer system to read the emotions of students is needed for a quality education. Students have been learning in schools without the Facial Action Coding System for hundreds of years, so why would the Facial Action Coding System help us now? The Facial Action Coding System could actually be unbeneficial to students in the long run. This system could make students feel uncomfortable and insecure about their learning.

The main reason that the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to students in a classroom is beause it is invading to the students privacy. The students may feel like their emotions are invaded by a computer that is constantly watching them. The Facial Action Coding System could make the student feel like they are being pressured and that their emotions for a certain day can alter their learning style. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"" (D'Alto). This shows that the system can watch the students' every move. Would you like to be watched all day by a computer that is reading your mood?

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System is not needed in the classroom is because many classes in school are taught by a teacher, not by computers. The Facial Action Coding System might not be used at all if the school is taught by a majority of teachers, which could be a waste of money and software. Dr. Huang says in paragraph 6 that 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Even though this statement is true about the Facial Action Coding System, many lessons in schools are not taught by computers, but are taught by teachers. The teacher could also probably tell if the students are bored or confused so they could alter their lessons. In paragraph 5, the author says that, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto). This shows that the classroom teacher could effectively alter their lesson based on the expressions of the students, just as the Facial Action Coding System could.

In some cases the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to the classroom and learning environment. If a student is taking online courses or a school is predominantly taught by computer lessons, the Facial Action Coding System would help students stay more focused. The system could try to change the way of teaching based on the viewer's expressions. The system can also be beneficial to ads on computers. ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto). This shows that the Facial Action Coding System could also make ads more interesting for those on computers often.

The Facial Action Coding System is definetly an amazing invention to computers and reading facial expressions. Although it is a great invention, I do not think that schools are ready for a program that studies the students' faces. This technology should not be used so it can protect the students' privacy, make them feel comfortable in the learning environment, and make them feel like their lessons are not forced. Many schools are also probably still taught by a majority of teachers, whearas the Facial Action Coding System would not be needed at all.

Many people have heard ""Fake it till you make it"", well that might work sometimes but now those people are gonna have to step up their game. A software has been made by a a team of professers and this software is called ""FACS"" or Facial Action Coding System. People belive robots and computers are not eligable to understand emotions but thats changing.

First of all, this software that has been created by two Professers. One of theses people is Dr. Huang from Beckman Institute for Advanced Sceince at the University of Illionis, and the other is Prof. Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. Together these two men are working and striving to devlop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Not only did this work later on, but they also made something very interesting its called FACS.

Also, the FACS software begins with a computer and this long code which then gets turned into a 3-D computer model of a face. This model includes the 44 major muscles in the face to replicate a human face and determine its emotion. They tested this technology on the famous Mona Lisa, which is a famous panting made by Da Vinci. In this panting there is a woman who is somewhat smiling but it doesn't appear t be a real happy smile.

Not only, when these two scientist ran a test on the Moan Lisa did they prove it worked, but they also got results of the emotions that were astonishing. The results showed that the woman in the panting was 83 precent happy, 9 precent disgusted, 6 precent fearful and 2 precent angry. This infromation came from a computer just running a scan and replicating the movement of the facial muscles. Not only was this a remarkable sceintific discovery, it also could become very helpful in many ways. We could take this software and read childrens and students emotions just by scanning the facial muscle movements, we could also even use this on older or people that can't express their feelings.

All in all, lets just face it we may have devloped a technoloy that can read peoples emotions and give us results based appon the simplest movements of their face muscles. Thats remarkable and not only is it going along with the tecnhnoloy these days, but its also so helpful. This is a tool that can become very effective and useful in schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and even mental instatutions.

In a way, the students can be learning at a way where the lesson will have their attetntion if it is interesting to them.

I agree that the FACS could help in a classroom with students and maybe even improve their way of learning. If the computer could see what facial expression the student has, the computer realizes the student gets bored then it might boost itself so that the lesson can becomoe interesting to the child. As I read the text called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I understood the point the author was making. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", Dr. Huang predicts. I highly think there would be a change in the academic learning environment. According to the passage, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"", meaning that the computers would also have to understand what the feeling is without actually communicating with the person.

Overall, I do agree with using the FACS in a classroom with students in a classroom to help the students and the learning environment. The computer system would read and determine what the emotion is by detecting how the muscles are behaving. Meaning that if most of the muscles are at rest, then the emotion would most likely be a resting face. If the professors are right abot their prediction, then we would see somewhat of a change.

Once again, people put quantity over quality, believing that something as complex and immaterial as human emotion can be quantified into a data set of integers and percentages.

This worship of machine, and the unjustified extension of its jurisdiction into domains it has no place whatsoever meddling with, finds itself expressed again in the recent technological concoction that is the ""Facial Action Coding System,"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, engineered and realized by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois and his colleagues. With this FACS, they believe that one's emotions can be easily identified and laid down on a neat percentage-based chart of X-percent this, Y-percent that. This technology, they believe, can be used in classrooms, as a means of ensuring a student's perpetual engagement in the lesson via improvisation of the lesson based on whatever calculations are made.

However, does one need to make a particular face to be bored, or confused? There are some faces we might make most of the time, possible some of us who make them all the time when losing interest or encountering confusion--however, that may not be so for all of us. There may be those whose faces might say, ""I understand the lesson,"" but their souls say ""What in the world is this?"" Similarly, their faces might say, ""I am intrigued by this,"" while within their hearts in reality, they are waiting for that relieving ring of the lunch bell to come upon their eardrums.

The human face is not a good indicator for emotion--if one wishes to be somewhat poetic, one could say that the human face is ""two-faced;"" It could tell you one emotion while hiding and masquerading another. One's face can be stern and mean-looking, while in fact underneath it lies the feeling of great satisfaction or relaxation. One's face can be happy and smiling (a physically genuine smile, too), maybe even laughing, while masquerading behind it, for some conscious or unconscious purpose, is a sorrowful melancholy that could wring tears from a stone.

In contrast to the thought behind this technology's premise, which claims that the human heart's imprints on the face can be ""classified [in to] six basic emotions--happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness--and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 3) I claim that human emotion can not be quantified. No one can rely upon the face to know the heart, just like no one can rely upon reason solely to know the Universe and the powers and Power beyond it. This technology should not be used in classrooms, or in fact anywhere really, for due to its erroneous foundation, there are bound to be erroneous results; not mere outliers, but I would say a significant chunk and portion of facial assessments. I am against the ""value"" of this technology being used to read students' emotions--for I am against this technology being used anywhere, and the false material-minded thinking which is its, and modernity's in general, foundational philosophy.",5,7,0.8087851405143738

imaginate if the computer know when your happy or sad, that well be so cool, then you know if someone is sad and you can help him or you can know if this person is happy and he make you happy two, the can be great to create new stuff like videogame tv show and all kinda things, most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotionalcomunication, so that mean the computers have to understand that too, sometimes not only moving your facial muscles make make you express your emotion but that maybe make you feel them,making that can reveal sabout the science of the emotions.",1,7,0.8361161947250366
2be962b,"The Facial Action Coding System would be cool. It would be cool if it can read your expressions. It would learn to read your face. It would give you things you like. It wouldnt give you things you dont like. It would be made just for you.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. It classifies six basic emotions. The six emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer model will learn exactly what your thinking. This will allow it to get to know you.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. The software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared to a neutral face. The new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. If you smile a web ad appears on your screen, it will know you like it. If you frown, it will know you don't.

The Facial Action Coding System will be helpful in the classroom. It would allow the computer to pop things on the screen that are a interest to you. You will be able to learn more because you will have more information on them. It will keep you focused in the classroom, and it will help you learn.

The Facial Action Coding System with its use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. After learning the 44 muscles of your face they will know what you like and you dont like. Your computer will be just for you. It will help students learn. It will also help them stay more focused.

2c23e62,"Can you believe there's actually technology that can identify your emotions ? There's a new technology that can show a how a human is feelings. It's called the Facial Action Coding System. This system can be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom by showing when kids are getting bored or confused, showing if fake emotions are being used, and help produce emotions.

First off, the system can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom by showing if the kids are bored or confused. By the computer allowing to show how the students are feelings, the teachers can look at that and they can actually change things up a bit in class. On paragraph 6 it says, "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Therefore, the FAC system can feel the same emotions as the students are feeling and show how the students are feeling.

On the other hand, the FAC can also identify if fake emtions are being used. When you fake a smile the system can tell when it a real smile or a forced one. On paragraph 8 it says, "" Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis pars palpabreaus make crow's-feet around your eyes.But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideway using the zygomatic major and different muscle, the risorius."" Which means the FAC knows when the smile is real or fake when the way your smile is being structured.

Lastly, another way that expressing emotions in a classroom is valuable is helping produce emtions. Making an expression can also help you feel an emotion. That way this can help the students show their real emotions. On paragraph 9, the author says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emtions but, also may even help produce them. ""Therefore, that can change whole mood and emotions of a students. Helps students change what they are feeling.

The Facial Action Coding System can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom showing that the system is valuable by showing when kids are getting bored or confused, if fake emotions are being used, and to help produce emotions. So yes, this technology is very valuable for a classroom. FAC can be a great use to read humans.  ",4,7,0.8575966358184814

In the passage Dr. Huang explains how Da Vinci studied human anatomy to precisely paint the facial expression of the Mona Lisa to to show what emotion she is displaying or feeling. Huang also explains if you physically make a certain face to display a certain emotion that you will actually feel that emotion. Technology like this can also help make more detailed and expressive face for either video games or for video surgeries.

This form of technology has countless uses in either the classroom and even more types of jobs and sciences. Being able to teach hman emtion in a hands on way will help with making people and students understand what basic human emtions and how certain muscle groups help in with physically showing these these emtions and how they can be better understood.

2c5309d,"Is the ""Facial Action Coding System"" really going to be able to read and react to students emotions? Well this new technology can read the facial expressions of a student therefore it can change the classwork based off how the student is feeling but, a computer can't really read a students true emotions just based off their facial expressions.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman is used in a new innovation created by Prof. Thomas Huang, Prof. Nicu Sebe and their collegues. This Innovation is a sort of program that allows a computer to read a persons emotions based off their facial expressions The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, states Dr. Huang. Although the facial expressions of a person are similiar to another like smiling for example, however we may unconsciously have an expression even though we are not feeling the emotion that expression conveys.

""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" this shows we may show an expression without truly feeling that emotion the expression suggests. Therefore can this technology really help a student in a classroom setting?

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. with this said it may become frustrating or irritating to the student with the constant changes. This technology sounds very convincing but think of an emotionally challenged teenager can the computer keep up or truly read the emotions of the teen just by facial expressions alone? ""Eckman has classified six basic emotionshappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."". The technology can always improve but at the state it's in right now it may not be as accurate as needed to be in a classroom setting with only having the basic emotions proggramed. Although the technology is advanced and helpful to an extent it may not be something we can use right now.

This technology is helpful but also not good enough for students to enjoy and be helpful. This technology as previously mentioned can alter the classwork a student is doing based off their emotional state. According to Dr. Huang this technology can read mixed emotions as well but with only six to go off of it may not be a truly accurate answer and may make the student feel another emotion because it could not respond properly. This technology should be tested and improved on before going in a classroom setting.

In conclusion the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a technology not ready to be put in schools but is still a good innovation. The new technology can't read all their emotions just based off expressions alone but in the future change accordingly to a students emotions hopefully based off not just expressions and be ready for students to utillize.

I think the Facial Action Coding System should be used inside and outside the classroom. It would help the teachers know what is going on inside the students heads. In which then they could give the lesson in a way that the students could feel better about their work. This also would help the teachers know what may be happening in he students lives. The Facial Action Coding System could also be used to look at pictures of people and see what their emotions were when that picture was taken. The Facial Action Coding System could and should also be used at everyday jobs. It would let the employees boss/bosses know what emotions they are feeling while working. Which would then let their boss/bosses know whether to fire them or change their work environment. Which in the long run would lead to happy, not as upset, or any other positive emotions the employees could have.

The Facial Action Coding System should definitly be used in classrooms, and even in the workforce. I think this technology should be released to the public as soon as possible. Even though most people can read others facial expressions just by looking at their face.",3,7,0.8232766389846802

Mona lisa have 83 percent happy , 9 percent disgusting, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. They explain this just because of a software computer read Mona Lisa face.

The coumputers are very smart at this time but a computer that reads face is a little bit complicated because they can do almost everything that a human wants but reading face is not so hard. Using technology to read emotions expressions of students in classroom is not so good because students can read faces too.

Of course some people have trouble to describe faces because some people doesn't show feelings and other do.

How people feel it depends on them. most people are happy and others sad but every single people can be happy it depends on them not in other persons. The people that are always happy are the ones who thinks positive the ones that love their self a machine can read their faces but the machine doesn't know that humans can change their mind in less than an minute we can be happy and then we can be sad for a sad news but for the computer it will take time to know when human change emotions because it has to read I again the whole face , compare to us the human can see fast when other person get sad. like a quote it say ""The Mona Lisa desmonstrate ir really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". this mean that the computer is smart it can read faces .

The technology is good for in some reason but reading faces too easy for human and humans doens't need a computer to tell hom the other person is feeling becuase humans can read faces too. their is no reason that human need a computer to tell them when ever a person is sad or happy.

By scanning your face you'll be able to see the muscles that move on your face to decide the emotion you have. Techology today is greatly advancing and advandcing fast.

It all begins when the3-D computer scans your face for all 44 muscles.That way they can tell you what mood your in. In the text it says "" For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above the eye) rasies your eyebrows when your suprised"". This quote connents to the claim becuase it gives you a visual on what muscles describes your emotion. Dr. Paul Eckman believes theres six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and saddness. Each characteristic has a movent of the facial muscles. Theres a differerce between expression and emotion. expression is just the face you make at the moment your doing somehting. emotion is how you feel. In the Text it says "" Its all about those muscle action units. The computers can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major( muscles that begin at your cheek bone) lifts in the corner of your mouth"".

Yet Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo Da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emoitions.

Remember thst one day you were sad ? Just never showed that emotion/ expression so you would not get ask ? Your apperence is never what you actually feel on the inside is it ? That is because face expression hids it all. Now there is a computer system that catches your human emotions.

According to some new technonlgy named, Facial Action Coding, this system identifies humans emotions. This technology is not the right way to find students human emotions. Facial Action Coding seems to just identify just your face. A face expression can hid your actual emotion. Systems like this have the chance to not be right. Make believe what this system is all about.

Secondly, the students expression may change during the day. At some point a studnets can feel pressered after a class of even before there next class. These emotion have the accursy to not be the same during a students day. Calculating these emotion, can not be like working on a math problem. Emotions can change in the matter of a second. You just dont know what can happen at any minute that changes your expressions.

Lastly, this system would not be good to keep students emotion. It would be better to talk the student face to face, if you ever see or feel like something it going wrong with them. Like the article says you never know how your teacher feel when she is grading your assigment.

I believe the Facial Action Coding should not be used on students. I would rather let a teacher talk face to face with there studnets to see what the situation is all about.

The Facial Action Coding System may not be as accurate as they say it is. In the Mona Lisa, she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fear, and 2 percent angry. This might be accurate, but the author tells the reader that technology gave the Mona Lisa its reading are based on, ""some new computer software that can recognize emotions.

The article also says that, ""each expression is compared against a nuetral face (showing no emotion)."" (paragraph 4) Every child has a different face, you have to account to many variables when using this technology. Since all children are different, their neutral face is different also, therefore you cannot base a piece of technology on one single face.

In school not every kid wants to be part of something, not all children may want the teachers attention, and not all children want to be happy all the time. Schools need to take account to the kids that might not want to be bothered by the teacher. Some just want to go to school with a blank face and get through the day and get out.

The machines will lack the privacy that kids need. Everyone wants their privacy, and having technology that scan childrens faces isn't exactle private. Schools should be a place where kids can feel safe going. By implementing that technology, you are taking a part of their privacy away, thus the child might not feel safe anymore.

Secondly, the groupe of studants could use it for a project to have fun and use it on the studants that are in there groupe. On the other hand, studants could do different facial expressions to see what kind of facial expression comes out like if they are happy, sad, mad, or neutral. Another positive reason is that your home PC is not able to do anything like this so it is a new experience for everyone. Lastly, I think that the studants from all ages would like to do this because nobody has ever experienced this before.

2ea704f,"The Facial Action Coding System technology that let you reads emotional expressions of students. I strongly disagree with this statement because emtions is not some that you can just get a computer software to scan you to let you know if your happy or sad. How can a computer just express how humans feel emotions are some you feel when another person tell you that you are speacial, and not by letting a computer tell you. Computers are program to do what you wan them to do and help with things such as homework, research pappers and essays they are a software system bulit to help you with over the site needs.

Dr. haung and his collegue are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. I feel like you can't just program a computer to pick what emotions you think students are feeling,a and what if the software system was wrong and thats not what the student was feeling. Emotions are a feeling you get when you feel like you don't have a care in the world , or when that special someone makes you happy because they smiled at you those are emtions they are inside you not on a machine that was bulit by man to tell you how you feel.

And in my conclusion the facial expressions for each emoion are univeral oberves,and even though individuals show varying degress of expressions. Each student have the own facial expression is compared aginst a neutral face showing no emotion in a student face. A machine that will let you know if a student is borde or confused is good but that's why we have are own voice to let our teacher know that we need help.",2,7,0.8966213464736938

It says in the atricle that "" We humans perfrom this same imressive ""calculation"" every day."" This means if we as humans can detect emotions through actions and facial expressions, why cant technology? At the end of the day we humans are the ones that create technology and we can set its limits and control what it does. It also says in the article "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This shows that the technology doesn't just guess emotions. It takes time to look at muslces and the ways they move and it calculates the emotions. It also says in the article ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."" This could be very helpful in classrooms becuase a lot of students struggle with things like that, and this technology would be a great help to a large group of people. This makes the techonology valuable becuase it could benefit students in their education and help them out. In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System is a very valuable thing. It can help change the way people do things, and can help in classrooms. People could find ways to use this technology to create new things that could do even more. It could start as just this system and evolve into something way bigger and effective. ",2,7,0.886378824710846

Will now therei is it`s called,""Facial Acton Coding System"" as transfered too FACS. In the aticle Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D`Alto this commputer likewise tells us your emotions. And you muscules on your face what it tellls us if your haooy. It also tells us different reactions.

In the article This computer FACS can tell us how your muscles can helps the omputer with the emotion you are feeling. In the article on paragraph 3 it says ""Eckamn has classified ix basic emotionsa-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movement of the facial muscles""(3). FACS loooks your face muscles to indecate what your emotion and true emotion in front of the video you are showing. It can tell if you are happy, sad or desgusted.

FACS can also tell emotions just like on your face musles. In the article in paragrph 4 it says,"" the new emotion-recogniton software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or painted face of Mona Lisa""(4).This new computer can even exam you emotions on your face like it did on ona Lisa. Also, FACS even works on painted faces. It can tell if the painting of the persons face is happy not.

Another thing FACS can recongise what your face is doing face. In the article in paragraph 6 it says,""if you smile when a wed ad appears on you screen, a similar ad might floow. But if you fron, the ad willl be different. ""A classrom computer could recongize when a students is becoimg confused or bored""(6). FACS is a really cool computer that tells us what on your face how it reacts and recongise the face expression you can give in a classrom.

Inconclusion, FACS is a computer to set a facial action coding sytem to know if your expression. Also, it`ll know if you are faking it by your face muscles. It recongize your expressions you can give druning a class. FACS also works on paintings.

Sometimes humans can show many emtions and we might not know whet they are for example there ar ethe simple emtions such is happy, excited, sad, anger, but then there are other emmtions where it might be mixed like happy but sad or angry and sad and sometimes emtions we might not even know what they are and that when the Facs comes in to see what emtion someone might be feeling. There can also be a hiddin emtion within someone when someone might seem happy they might show it on the outside but in the inside they are probly feeling another emotion. One way Facs can be very helpful is by knowing wether that person is going thru some stuff for example a person could be thinking about commiting suicide but nobody would know until their facial expression shows that and it might not be a sad facial expression it could be a diffrent one but with the Facs it would be able to tell someone right away what emotion they are feeling.

2f3bda4,"Have you ever been faced with a boring computer assignment? Maybe you have dreaded coming to school or finishing your homework? As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students.

Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow"" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.

By the same token, using this sort of technology in the classroom will keep a student engaged during their lessons. When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, ""[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and further explains that ""[the system] could modify the lesson"" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can ""identify mixed emotions"" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged.

Finally, this system may change the ways in which many students view school. It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a ""fake smile"" and that to them ""faces don't lie"" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them"" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.

Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether. If you had the choice to experience in this program within your classroom, what do you thing the outcomes may be? ",6,7,0.8606921434402466

In my opinion there shouldn't be a facial action coding because they may seem happy but they might not actually be happy. There are many things wrong with this idea. Maybe your having a bad day but still pretend to be happy and then go to the machine says your happy when your really not. How do they know what a happy, sad, angry face looks like anyways. Everyone has a different way of expressing theirselves. Some people may look say but be happy look happy but be mad but there are many ways you can feel but not look like that emotion. Students also may not like it because some kids like to keep their emotions to themselves. They say it can read all the muscles in the facce but how will they know you are not faking it at all. a lot of machines can malfunction in multiple ways good or bad mostly bad. What happens if it's reading your face and it acidenally blows up what are you supposed to do? They say if you make yourself smile you will soon actually be happy I don't think that is the case. If you smile yeah you look happy but are you actually happy on the inside I don't think so.

Technology can maybe believe that they know someones emotions by their faces expressions but the inside is what actually matters if you really know how someone feels. But also sometimes it can be very confusing because they are showing a lot of diffferent emotions and they are maybe confused themself. But thats okay a lot of people feel that way.

But someone really doesnt know just by the face just you cause its you. And its the same for technology they really cant tell what your emotion is just by looking at you. unless you're really happy and sometimes you can actually show an emotion inside and out and if your computer can tell an actual emotion thats true well maybe because you really are feeling happy, sad, Etc.

308be53,"Why The Facial Action Coding System Is Irrelevant

Sometimes people have bad days, and it can have a huge impact on others, but only if people choose to show it. Human emotion can be displayed in many ways. Some ways emotion can be expressed are through body language and facial movements/changes. However one chooses to show their emotion is all their decision, and it does not need to be known by everyone else. The Facial Action Coding Sytem is not valuable because it is a person's own choice to decide whether or not they want someone else to know how they are feeling, emotions are not relevant to students in a classroom, and there are not many ways that knowing emotions can benefit people in their careers.

A person's emotions do not involve other people. Although emotions can be caused by others, emotions do not have to be known by others. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", by Nick D'Alto, the author states ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" If a person can already make a guess on how someone may be feeling on their own, why would they need The Facial Action Coding System? This would be an actual waste of technology because it would be doing a natural job that a human can do on their own.

Students in a classroom are there for learning about subjects such as math, science, language arts, and social studies, neither of which involves emotions. Bringing The Facial Action Coding System into a classroom would be more distracting than helpful. Students and teachers should be focused more on the lesson than how one is feeling during it. In the article, it says that A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" In this case, students could also become very playful with the technology and trick it to access unreliable feedback.

Knowing emotions may benefit pychologists when wanting to understand the true feelings of one of their patients in a career based setting. However, in a classroom setting, reading student's emotional expressions is not needed. Some students may not enjoy school, but they are still required to go. The article notes that Dr. Huang adds Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This means that not only would The Facial Action Coding System be able to read the emotions of students, but it would also takeover the job of being a teacher. This is a disadvantage for teachers since they are there to answer any questions and do the lesson planning. This would also put many teachers out of a job.

There are very few benefits, there is no relevance for knowing the emotions of students, and any emotions of a person may not want to be detected, therefore The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable. Technology is supposed to be beneficial to humans and make life easier. The Facial Action Coding System does the opposite of that. Emotions should be revealed through a person's own wish, not through a computer. This could make many people very angry, due to the programming of this technology. The goal behind The Facial Action Coding System may be to read emotional expressions, but the emotions created, by people, from being able to do so could become very upsetting.

308d061,"""And that is the composition of the typical human."", the Biology teacher wraps up her lecture in a rather slow, drawn out, manner. The poor students, trapped in the classroom with nothing to entertain them, but boredom. How will the teacher know when to cease this unbearable tourture? FACS may be the answer. If it could accurately give the teacher information on her students' feelings about the lecture, this could be extremely valuable information to help make the lecture more entertaining, and fun, for the students. My personal opinion, one that has been developed through experience, is students maintain the information, presented in the lecture, better if the teacher makes the lesson interesting and entertaining.

As mentioned in the paragraph above, I believe having a FACS in classrooms would be a useful asset for teachers across the country, or even the world. You see, the muscles in the human face move a certain way when expressing certain emotions. The six basic emotions, as described in the third paragraph, are happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The problem is some of the emotions can not be read by the naked eye. Allow me to explain. Have you ever heard of masking emotions? A fine example would be an individual forcing a smile at someone they do not care for. Different muscles are used in a forced smile, in comparision to a natural smile. Some people have perfected the art of ""fake smiling"",and the human eye can have problems noticing the person is actually doing a fake smile. The FACS, however, notices the muscles being used to make the facial expression. The FACS can see small details the human eye would miss. Having this program in classrooms would help teachers to make their lectures a little bit more fun, you could say, for the students.

In conclusion, I am on the side that says we should allow this technology to be utilized in classrooms. This could be a game-changer for teachers. With this technology, teachers will be able to read the students' expressions with accuracy. Also, if the lectures are not dull, students seem to maintain the information being taught to them better. Will this technology ever be used in classrooms? I do not kinow. All we can do is wait!",3,7,0.687273383140564
309bd04,"Facial expressions and emotions drive the actions of people everyday. These emotions are sometime hidden, fake or very transparent. I believe that using this Facial Action Coding System in class rooms, will be quite valuable to the learning enviroment and education of idividuals. It will increase learning efficiancy, focus in the class room, and productivity of the students.

The Facial Action Coding System essentially scans your face for emotion and makes decisions based on the results. This would be very valuable in a classroom especially those of younger students and gradeschool. During school students can be unmotivated to learn, bored or confused in the classroom. These problems can waste time and cause students to not fully understand and learn the topic.

If this system can produce the outcome predicted this will lessen the amount of time, and help students to understand the topic more and at a quicker rate. By moving at the students speed and manipulating the lessen at points where the student is confused can be more efficient than the classrooms now. This system will eliminate the wasted time, bordem and provide solutions for those confused.

As well as increasing the efficiency, this sytstem can also benefit the classroom enviroment. When students become bored or unmotivated, they can become a distraction in the classroom. Teachers then have to take time to meet the need the student has. This disruption in the class can catch the attention of other students and cause them to stop working and or act as the other student is. Distractions like these cause learning to be hindered and if eliminated it can better the learning enviroment for teachers and students. This system, can keep students active and motivated to learn, providing less of a chance to be a distraction.

Furthermore, if distraction, bordem and unmotivation is eliminated or improved in the classroom enviroment, this can increase productivity. Students when bored or unmotivated essentially stop working, and students who are confused work at a slower pace. These problems cause the work that needs to be done, not completed or completed slower than neccessary. This system can keep the attention of students and create a path that the student learns at their own rate, thus completing the work that needs to be done ontime or quicker. This can benefit the classroom because teachers do not need to review topics that some students might have understood but others have not.

In conclusion this system is the most efficient, productive and helpful tool that a class room could be aquipped with. It eliminates bordem and unmotivation, causes more efficient learning and allows productivity in the classroom to increase. All teachers should implement this tool in their classroom if presented the opportunity. ",5,7,0.8036810159683228

In the text they talk about a program called Facial Action Coding System that will use our emotions to make our experience with technology better.

The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valiable because ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive.

Ads are an example on how the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable. In the text it states ¨For example, if yoy smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be dirffent.¨ (D´Alto).

So if a student is doing somthing on a computer and an ad pops up for a math game and he dosnt like it the next ad could change to a math game that he does help.

The ads coud help the student find a game that can help him learn. Ads and keeping the student mare intrested are ways the Facial Action Coding System is valuble.

Keeping the students intrested is also another way the Facial Action Coding System can be benifical to a student. In the text it says ¨A classroom computer coud recognize when a student is becoming confused¨ (Dr. Huange).

If it could reconize that then it could modifiy the lession.

The lession would be better for a student and also it would be like having a teacher right next to you teaching you in the way you learn best.

Keeping the students intrested is anothe way the Facial Action Coding System can be valiuble but there is one more example.

The Facial Action Coding System can make animated faces more expressive.

The author states ¨ The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive¨ (D´Alto).

When taking an online corse if a animated faces could be more expressive it would make the student more involved.

Also it could make the student feel like they have some one to help right next to them.

This is how making animated faces more expressive can help students in a classroom.

This is how ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive help support the claim that the use of emotinal reading technology can be valuable for a student.

By making things more personal.

Also by keeping the student intrested so they dont get side tracked. Finaly by keeping the student happy.

Movement of one or more mucles is called a ""action unit."" The man thing is weather or not this ""Facial Action Coding Syste"" should be used to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valube . But there can be some good things about this and there can be some bad things about this. The pros is id the computer can read if the kid is strugling with somthing and the teacher could come help the kid. Also the computer can read if the kid is depressed and needs help with somthing going on in his or her life. The cons isinvasion of privice. But with all these pros and cons I think we should have the ""Facical Actions Coding System"".

My first reason why we should have these computers is for school. In the artical the author says ""A classroom computer could recognizewhen a student is becoming confused or bored."" What this means if a kid is stuggling or confused the computer can read that the kid is in need of help on the thing he is working on and the teacher can come help the kid. Also the good thing is if the kid is confused and needs help, but if the kid is shy or scared to ask qustions the computer can tell the teacher he or she needs help on what they are working on. Last if the computer knows the person in confused the computer can stop what the kidis doing and help that person on what they are doing. This is my first reason on why we need this computer system in all schools.

My second reason is the computer can read kids emotions and can help the person. "" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of corse, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This shows if a person is depressed and needs help but is scared to tell anybody the conputer can tell that friend so that friend can help that person out. Also this can tell if a person is angry and the actions that person could do when they are angry helping that person out and other people around them, beacuse of the actions that person can do while they are mad. Last this device can save lifes of people who think of suicide beacuse the computer can warn peopel these sighns helping the person out and many more people. This is my second reason why all schools should have the computer system.

My third and last reason is the computer can help that person be happy if they are sad and depressed. According to Facial Feedback Theoryof Emotions"" Putting on a happy face actually works!"" Also "" imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be differnt."" What this is saying is if you are watching somthing and ad comes on and it makes you happy the computer know that you like if and it would more like that. But if a ad comes on you dont like it and frown the computer knows that and will change it fast so you stay happy. With this computer doing that it could keep a lot of kid happy. This is my third reason why all schools should have this computer system.

Some people my not agree with me. Some people may say that it is advading your privace. But I think the computer should beacuse the computer can svae lives. Also help kids learn. Last it can keep kids happyand not sad. With the computer doing all of this we can keep a healthy life style and a safer envoroment for every body.

A reasion this could be a good idea is becaues you be able to tell if some one is lying to you. Like if there is a bad persion in court and you wont to know if there lying to your face you just look at the machine and it would tell you. Though some people would like to keep some things a scorit you be able to tell is there lying to you and if there sad as well then you know its a secorit.

My second reasion for going with the FACS is becaues it may be able to uncover crimes like if the dead persion was sad or happy when they die. Some family members may want to know that but will never know if they don't have the FACS. The FACS seem to be good on paintings so I was thinking that it may work on a dead body. Becaues if it works on Mona Lisa, then it should work on anything that dont use muscle ever or in the past like a dead body.

My therd reasion is if you make it be useable on animals then we can uncover a lot of mysteryes. Like if you wanted to know how your dog or cat felt about you all you had to do was turn on the FACS and see. We could also see if lions kill becaues there mean or becaues they dont know what eals to do. Many things could be uncover thnks to FACS.

Thess are my reasions for choosinf the FACS becaues it can help humans in many ways. We could be one step closer to uncovering mystoryes. I like the idea but many people may dissagree becaues they might say that they want to keep things scroit. But like I sead earlyer use the machine if there lying but also sad then you know it is a scorit. So I beleve the FACS should be able to go to anyone that wants it but that is just a thought.",3,7,0.46037375926971436

I notied alot of vaulid points and and good reasoning behind the idea of the Human Emotion things I feel as if it would slove promblems around and help people thats suffuring from addiciton, depression ""happiness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness"" and other things that they are going threw . It will help out wsith people that dont like speaking up or that is swcared of what other people will think or say about them if they ask for help or even reach out for help. And ill support my answer with ""A Classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". and "" Most human communcation is nonverbal, including emotional communcation.""

3157b9b,"As many countries in the world starting on develop high techonology, the use of computers is very necessary. Scientists begin working on study new techonology to help humans lives become more convinience. One of the new uses of techonology is that reading, and identifying human emotions. While highschool students usually have trouble to know their friends, and classmates oppinions about them, the new technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" in a classroom is valuable.

The use of computers to read humans emomtions expressions is helpful, because it can read emotional expression accurately, and people will need it, especially students. Highschool students often curious about what people think about them, but somtimes they could not know what the emotion exactly means. Therefore, they need techonology that can help them, specifically the Facial Action Coding System. This techonology allows computers to analyze both simple and complex facial expressions. In order to do this, the computer has to built up 3-D movements of facial muscles, and all those movements are the same as movements of the face in real life. One more way we can tell this technology can work well is that it compares every emotion to a no emotion face, because it says ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" in the text. With its characteristics, the Facial Action Coding System can help students in classes. Students then can understand their classmates, partners easier. They would feel more confidence, and could focus on lessons better.

The purpose of studying techonology is to help humans lives become better, all techonologies are really useful and have certain value to humans, including the use of Facial Action Coding System. This is a technology that can help identify correctly people feeling base on what they are showing in their faces. When highschool students often face challenges to understand other students facial expressions, the use of this techonology is needed. It is not only because it can work well, but it also help classes more effectively by improving students feeling. This technology is very valuable, and every students will need one.

The quote says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System).""

Most of the experts can identify how people feel about anything like bored, happy, and etc. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vinci Code!""

3242556,"FACS: the Facial Action Coding System, or possibly the future of teaching. FACS can use all fourty-four major muscles of a face model from a computer to classify how a person is feeling based on six basic emotions. Those six emotions are happiness, anger, disgust, fear, suprise, and sadness. This has major potential to be used anywhere, but the best place could be the classroom. FACS should be used in a classroom because it can read a person's emotions, and could change a lesson if students are bored or confused over a less.

FACS was used on the famous Mona Lisa and produced some very interesting results. It stated that ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" That is the true emotion of Mona Lisa according to a computer. But Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at Illinois University, belives that this could be used for more than just reading the emotion of people in paintings. He and Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam think that the software can be used on the classroom.

First, we need to know how does FACS work. Dr. Huang uses the computer to construct a 3-D model of the face. If movement at one or more of the fourty-four major muscles in the model occurs, that is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Huang then uses the work of psychologists to take it one step further. Dr. Paul Eckman is one the psychologists work used as he is the creator of FACS. Eckman classified six emotions, and then associated each with movements of facial muscles, such as ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised."" But Dr. Huang knows the true potential of FACS, the classroom.

A classroom computer with the FACS software could read the emotions of kids in a classroom. It then could change up a lesson if most students are bored or confused. Lets say a student or multiple students aren't understanding a lesson very well from the notes and is confused. The computer could create a game to play that not only makes students excited, but helps them understand the lesson more. This could be crucial towards the future of education.

FACS could become the next teacher assistant for a classroom and succeed at a high standard. The system could lead to better grades for students and lead to a higher graduation rate at universities. This is just the beginning of FACS, and the future only gets better for something as powerful as this. That, ladies and gentleman, is true potential of FACS, the future of education all over the world.",4,7,0.7847182750701904

When glancing around the class to check the time on the clock a classmate has no idea what facial expression they are making. It's difficult to detect an unharmful face of a classmate if they seem angry and ready to rumble , even though the classmate is actually just confused about the assingment that was given.

Dr. Huang has created the new emotion-recognition software for that humans can now have a better understance of how a person feels about certian topics. "" The software can even identify mixed emotions."" There will not be any more wondering or confusion with assingments that are dificult to some students. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" The computer will then modify the lesson for the student , so he/she can comprehen the lesson. This will allow the generator to be like an effective human instructor.

The emotion-recognition software might be on the verge to help lower the sudicial rate in America or around the world. ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen , a similar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different."" If a person is prone to having destructive thoughts then the ad changing could imbue them to getting the help they need.

Using the Facial Action Coding system is a waste of time and money. ""Hold on! Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions--like math homework?"" There's no need to calculate anything that doesn't require math. Think of all the good other inventions coud in place of this technology, we could be one stop closer to developing a way to supply people with clean water all around the world. Not because we want something in return, but because helping someone is something you should want to do. But instead these Prof think our current technology is more useful in schools to detect when a child is bored doing work.

"" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. Fr instance, you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. ""There's way more situations in the world where these Prof. should put their minds to, we don't need more technology to tell us how people are feeling, that's why our world isn't connected in person. People now a days don't know how to talk or even hold a conversation due to the lack of communication skills we use because of social media. Instead of going out and buying something as barbaric as the Facial System, we should go and actually talk to our peers and understand them more so we can know their facial expressions and know how they're doing.

I am against the value of using of this technology to read students' emotional expressions due to the fact we (as in the people) need to be more connected in the real life rather then push ourselves further away using social media and new technology that we do not need.

32cce18,"The new Facial Action Coding System cannot be very accurate due to humans being able to hide emotions quite easily. As it says in the beginning statement, ""improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others."" Thus meaning this software is not one-hundred perect reliable. Human beings can hide emotions without even trying. It is impossible to tell what someone is actually feeling.

In many movies actors act amd perform in different emotions everyday. Think about how an actor can use deception to trick the watcher into thinking they are upset and angry in the movie. Behind thr scenes the actor could be hystrically laughing but we dont see that, we only see the acting part. Therefor it is impossible for human beings to be able to detect someones true emotions, not even an advanced computer application can do so.

In paragraph 2 a statement catches the eye by saying, ""Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotionslike math homework?"" First off the human body is not a calculation, it is a living creature that has feelings and emotions. You dont just calculate the emotions to find them out. To find emotions you get emotionally attatched to someome or get close to them by talking to thrm amd they will vent to you and find out what is going on, either if thry are happy or sad.

In the writing it talks about Mona Lisa,and how she was feeling during that moment. Many may say you can do this and find out how she was feeling, but others will say it is impossible to find her emotions. Those others would also say to find her true emotions you would have to ask her, in which you can no longer do because she and the artist are deceased. No one will trully know how she felt durung this time, unless she states her feelings somewhere.

In paragraph 6 it states that,""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad."" It later on states thag only looking into the webcam it could detect your emotions. Not only could it really not detect your emotions, it would make people feel unsafe because they are constantly being watched looking for a face to read. The Facial Action Coding System cannot read someones true emotions.

32d692d,"Using the same technology configured using the Facial Action Coding System into school technology would be a valuable tool in the classroom because the often hidden signals or vibes students show can often give teachers mixed feelings about the effectiveness of their lessons or how student are being treated emotionally by others, but this is still something that we must not make this something that interfears or plays with the personal feelings of the students. It would be a valuable addition to any classroom for its in-depth look into how the information is reaching the students, how they are reacting, and what the teacher can do differently to get the most out of thier lesson plans.

Especially in the mornings and end of the day, students' laziness, tiredness, or anticipation to get home can often disturb with how teachers percieve how their lesson plans are effecting the child. With the same Facial Action Coding System in our own school computers, online activities and assignments can track the emotional responses of the students while they work such as their attentiveness. Since this technology is, ""compared against a neutral face"", teachers will be able to witness firsthand their student's reactions. Oftentimes, early morning weariness or late school day excitement can fool the teacher's perception of the situation, but with the analyzing of the six basic emotions using ""video imagery"" of the, ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"", this technology would be able to offer to give an accurate conclusion to the student's reactions to each lesson.

Another commonly addressed situation is when students become ""confused or board"" with an assignment; both of these natural reactions show that the challenge level is not suited to the student's level. Teachers often want to offer help to the confused and challenge or entice board students, but these emotions are often not shown to the human eye. Especially with confused students, they hide this sense of confusion from the teacher to avoid embarassment. However, with this new technology, students who need more attention can be noticed. With the software's facial recogntion using minor muscle movements, it can make a conclusion without the student fully showing the emotion. With this in depth look, teachers are able to provide tutoring for those who need extra explaination and modify of their lessons for individuals who are not finding interest or challenge in the current lesson. With this technology, teachers will be able to realize how challenged each student needs to be even when they put up a ficade.

Another way that this teachnology can offer help to the students is with the daunting and huge school problem of bullying and depression before it leads to events much more serious. Since this technology picks up on feelings such as fear or saddness, these indications could be the first warning signs of when a student is taking their first steps into one of these two situations. Such as with the example of politicians and celebrities, even fake smiles are attributes will be able to be seen through. This is a serious problem in our day and age, so if these signs are reported reguarly and continuously, this may be the closest a student comes to calling for help. With this information not being able to be tricked through false emotions, students can recieve the mental and emotional help or stability they need.

Despite this great new innovation as well as all of the new data teachers can gather on their methods of teaching, we must ensure that this technology does not dive into the personal emotions students want to keep to themselves. Because many schools are now having take-home Chromebooks or Ipads, the school board needs to make sure that the students have thier own emotional security when at home. Teachers need to be careful and be reminded that there is a boundery between checking up with these emotional resonces for lesson planning and interfearing with the student's personal life. Otherwise, stuents will feel insecure both in and out of school because their core emotions such as a recent breakup might be revealed.

Facial Action Coding Systems for schools would allow teachers and students to more understand each side's perspective, so the students can be helped to the fullest extent they can be taught. This simple idea is building off of the simple idea of everyday empathy into the perspective of our school technology. This new technology would come with a pricetag, but being able to more effectively teach in the classroom would be well worth the money. Human emotions can be a difficult factor to implicate seen with examples such as the varying emotions with The Mona Lisa, but this technology will allow us to revolutionize our schools into an education build by the reactions of students and the lesson modifications of teachers.

32de0f4,"As a student, has your learning process ever been impeded by your emotional state? Have you ever wished a teacher could read your mind? The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about a new software system called the Facial Action Coding System which can detect emotions based on facial movements. Technology such as the Facial Action Coding Systems can be valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom and sensing varying degrees of boredom, confusion, or sadness; this data can then be used to create better fit lessons for the students.

To begin, Prof. Thomas Huang and his team have been working to develop ways for robots to better communicate with people. The Facial Action Coding System, which calculates movement of all 44 major muscles on your face, was created. These movements can be used to classify happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

First, in a classtoom setting, this system could be used to detect whether a student is bored with a lesson plan. The lesson plan could then be changed. Next, the Facial Action Coding System could also be used to detect if a student is confused. This data could indicate that a student may need additional help with a lesson or an alternate lesson plan. Lastly, another emotion the Facial ACtion Coding System could help with is sadness. If the system dectects that a student is constantly sad, the school administration can look into this and verify that the student is emotionally stable.

For many students, a poor emotional state as well as confusion and boredom, impede their ability to learn in school. In a classroom setting, a Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to detect a student's current emotion and adjust the lesson plan accordingly.             ",3,7,0.8987517356872559

Now, is this technology needed in a classroom? It really does not need to be in a classroom, but it can be used for more important task like using it to see other old painting expressions.

For most children in school they all have mixed emotions, and what does seeing how happy they are change anything. Children go to school to learn and get education. Some children are happy to be at school, while some are not happy to be at school. And thoes children already show their expressions. When a child is happy and wants to do work at school, they are the ones to always raise their hands and are bubbley. While the children that are not happy to be at school are usually the ones to not sit right, slouch, and do not raise their hands. Most schools say that they want their students to be happy at school, but with all the work that all children have to do and how they are taught to learn, they do not show the same effect on all children. Some children like things to go one way, while the other children like it the other way, so in that case not all children could be happy at school, unless they were to slit things up to make evey child happy and they still learn the things that they need to learn. In the article, it states,"" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's slime. But we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions,""(paragraph 7). If our computers at home can not handle the power that is used to detect one of our emotions, how can so many more computers on one software be able to do that. Schools need to spend money on other things like maybe new floors for the gym, or new lockers, what ever it is there are more important things that need to be done before spending money on a computer that can detect wheather we are happy or not.

A way that the Facial Action Coding System can be used in our schools is to see how every child likes the way they learn. Some children can be so comfused in a clas but they never ask for help because they are too embarresed to raise their hand so they hide behind a computer screen and never get the help they need. And if others can see his expressions and notice he needs help they could help out. There are children who need help but are too scared to raise their hands because then they will stand out, and maybe even made fun of. They hide behide a computer screen so people will not know who is confused or needs help. In the article, it states,"" By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece),""(paragraph 8). This states that it can identify if a child is confused, mad and/or sad about their issuse and their communitcation skills. It can help out the adules on the school help out the children of the school. If they had the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, it could help a lot of children come out of their shells and maybe even change in a fantastic way.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System is an amazing thing that can identify people's expressions, it does not really need to be in a classroom, but it can definetly come in handy. Maybe just in the libraray but not in every classroom. They can be very helpful for old paints and seeing those expressions. But there are people out there that put on a fake smile everyday to show others that they are not in pain when they actually are. A lot of people put on an ""act"" for others, meaning that they smile and looks so happy to others, while actually they are hurting and are in pain on the inside.

However, it is not always easy for people to read others' emotions. In the article, Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks about a new computer software called the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that was used to read the famous Mona Lisa's emotions. In the article, the author mentions this software being used in a classroom setting to read students' emotions to tell if they are confused or bored to modify the lesson like an actual teacher. The use of this software in a classroom would be extremely beneficial for students who struggle staying focused or are not interested in learning at all.

A student sits in class doing a computer lesson. However, this student is unable to sit still in their seat for a fraction of a second because of how bored they have become with the lesson. If the FACS was in use, the student would have a much easier time being engaged in their learning. If classes were to use facial recognition software for lessons, when students become frustrated or confused, the lesson will be able to adjust to the students' needs instead of having the students become frustrated with their teachers. Dr. Huang predicts if this kind of software was used in a class, the lessons would be able to modify ""like an effective human instructor."" The FACS would be extremely beneficial to students and teachers alike! However, some people would not agree with the claim that facial recognition software should be used in a classroom.

Someone might believe that the use of the FACS would not be helpful for students in a classroom setting. They may believe that the software is an unnecessary use of resources because they might not believe the software is effective because it may be unable to detect emotions in an effective way. In the article, it states that the Mona Lisa was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" They may believe that if the software detects mixed emotions, it would not be useful.

However, this claim is wrong in every sense of the word. The computer software is accurate enough to tell a real smile from a fake smile through the muscles that are being moved in the face. The software uses a 3-D computer model of the face and compare the expression of a user's face to a neutral face. ""All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles,"" so there is no way it cannot be accurate!

The use of the Facial Action Coding System for computer lessons would be an extremely beneficial addition to the classroom setting. It would make teaching and learning a lot more easier for teachers and students alike.

3358e08,"In everyday life people's emotions can affect certain things they are doing, like listening to or watching something. This is also the case in a classroom at school. Typically when a student is portraying positive emotions they will be more interested in the lesson and therefore pay more attention. The opposite goes for negative emotions, if a student is for example sad or worried they will be less interested in the lesson and pay less attention. Now if a teacher were able to detect when a student is portraying negative emotions, which is now possible with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), that could be very valuable, because it could make the classroom a better and more affective learning environment.

First of all if FACS was to be used in the classroom it could help teachers and instructors know whether or not a student is telling the truth about something based off of facial features. According to the article FACS can ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This means that if a teacher asks a student if they are doing okay and they smile back and say that everything is fine, even though it is not fine for them, FACS would be able to pick this up and notify the teacher so that they could help the student.

Secondly students already don't like going to school but, when they have to come to school and sit through boring lessons it makes things worse. Now teachers usually try to do their best to make the lectures as fun as possible in order for the students to stay engaged. This sometimes does not work out though and the teacher may not even realize it, but Dr. Huang predicts that FACS ""could recognise when a student is confused or bored."" With that the teacher could change what they are doing in the lesson to make it more engaging and therefore help students learn better.

So in conclusion, FACS would be valuable in a classroom environment, because it could help teachers be more affective with their lessons and get students the help they need to succeed at school and later on in life.

An example from the article is "" we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there faces"" Another thing why I think this type of technology is going to be useful, Is because maybe in the future all of the work could be handed over to the technology, Letting the technology do the work for us, Which would make it much easier for humans and less stressful to think about.

33a2f77,"I feel like I am for the value of this use of technology, because you can calculate other peoples facial emotions and your facial movements.

I feel like if you can calculate emotions on a persons face you could understand that person better and what there feeling.

You could do a 3-D model of the face and put in all of the muscles just like a human has on their face.

You could understand if their happy, suprised, or even sad. Your frontalis pars lateralis muscles ( above the eyes ) raises your eyebrows when your suprised or scared.

Your emotions could be all over the place.

You could have certian facial expressions.

For an example, you could have your fear look. You could've saw something that you're afraid of and have a fear look. The software could even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.

I know that everyone has different facial features, but some people have the same facial expressions.

I personally think that we should all have different facial features because no one can be the same and no one is perfect.

This technology could observe how our face is formed in the future.

This new technologyis the same technology for making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or surgery. "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication "" that Dr. Huang had. Computured need to understand that, too "" said Dr. Huang.

Your personal computer can't handle the complex of the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.

You sometimes has to ask yourself

"" Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"" and "" Can your lab partner recognize which one? "" So I think that this technology is a good idea.        ",2,7,0.822816014289856
33b12bc,"This facial expression recognizer is similar to the facial recognizers on your phone except it can determine the emotion you feel. The makers of this machine have tested it onto the mysterious woman know as the Mona Lisa. People were constatly making assumptions on how she was feeling whether happy or uncomfortable, but know we know exactly what she was feeling like. I have a concern about whether they tested this on other things but of coarse they did but I'd like to see the process of how this works because the Mona Lisa is a nonmoving painting while people are constantly feeling an aray of emotions.

I believe this technology would not be useful to read students emotions because student emotions can change from sitting in a classroom to taliking to a friend during a lesson. I believe that the machine would not be able to calculate the exact emotion a student is feeling quick enough because we can have multiple layers of emotions at the same time for instence fear, anxiety, and confliction. Also the machine would have to monitor multiple faces at onces since this is a classroom and find the emotions of the majority and gear the lesson towards that. I feel that the machine is only making assumptions because i put on a happy face and a happy tone all day but that does not make me happy thosse are just my characteristics. This can be useful once updated to the point where it can determine the emotions of multiple people but I don't think people want to wait an hour just to find out if you are happy, confused, or sad. Besides they literally sell those cheap necklaces that can supposedly read your emotions and they sell those worldwide in every giftshop but those are targetted to children ages 5 and up, but you don't see people wearing those so why would someone want this.

This technology is definitely an advancement in understanding human emotions and being able to write a code to recognize these emotion. We could use this idea and code to inbend them into artificial intellegence one day. The ability to read the Mona Lisas expression is definitely mind blowing since it is reading the face and not the paper is was drawn on or the code of the site/add which would have most likely come back in conclusive                           ",4,7,0.8520925045013428

Our emotions determine who we are and what we show from the expressions from our face. Its hard to determine what a person is thinking and what they are feeling at any moment of time. I think it is time though because someone has found a way to determine someone's emotions.

Finally someone has found a way to determine someone's feelings and emtions with a simple computer program. The person who worked and worked to show us this is Dr. Huang from Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans to communicate with computers. This idea for trying to communicate with computers brought up the idea of the feelings and emotions of a human being. They use simple calculations of the facial movements that are used to determine your feelings and emotions.

They begin the process with a 3-D process of the face and control every muscle on the face to mimic the emotions and feelings of a human being and that is amzing. The movements of the face is called a ""action unit"". Dr. huang relies on a psychologist to determine the emotions of that scan and to give six emotions that will determine every humans feelings within those six basic emotions. I think that these basic emotins are basically all the emotions any human uses for every day life. Thats why Dr. Paul Eckman picked them because them are the most common and most used emotions ever.

In paragraph three is the way humans move their muscles on their face to show emotions. Facial expressions are the one way humans can determine how someone is doing or feeling at that moment of time. In paragraph four they talk about how the program can even show that facial expressions of how Mona Lisa was feeling or what emotions she had of the time of the painting. The fact that we perform the same impressive calculation of determining a person's feelings just by looking at them is a perfect way for them to study and perfect the programs way to scanning emotions. The demonstractions of each scan are amazing at showing what the program and the computer can really do at a time where technology is at it's prime.

I feel like the computer and the humans who are trying to communicate with them are a great way to show feelings and emotions through talking. This program is gonna change the world of technology and the world of emotions for the better of the country and it's people. I think that what they are doing is a very constructive way of showing that you can find ways to determine a person's well being and their happiness. This program should be kept going at it's fullest for lots of years and should get to a point where it even helps out the crime system. As a last thought the program has to perfect this to get to maximum use of what should be used to help determine these feelins and emotions for the better.

33f9c31,"People have always been fascinated by da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"", partly because of the mysterious mix of emotions presented by the woman painted. However, according to ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, technology has decoded this mystery in the same way humans do - by analyzing emotions through facial muscular movements. This technological advancement is valuable because it allows technology to adapt to humans, rather than the other way around.

This new technology, called the Facial Action Coding System, simply acts the same way humans do by analzying the facial movements of another person. Therefore, the process used by the F.A.C.S. is nothing new, rather it is just a coded version of what humans are already capable of. Because of this, there is nothing to fear of its implications pertainting to its relative ""newness.""

Additionally, the implications of this technology could help students achieve a better education while still receiving the emotion that is present in a real classroom. According to the article, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" (D'Alto 6) which means that lessons can be tailored specifically for each individual student. Each year, more and more classrooms are implementing technology into their educational atmosphere. Implimenting the Facial Action Coding System simply enhances the overall experience the students receive from the compueter-generated lessons that are already in place today.

Moreover, this new system could be used to ""make computer-animated faces more expressive - for video games or video surgery"" (D'Alto 6). This type of implication would affect students of all ages. Younger students could play better-animated games that would help them learn more affectively while still learning and being exposed to empathy. Meanwhile, older students that are in college could benefit from being able to view a realistic surgery without the cost, time, or energy of working out a way to view a real one.

With all of these benefits and the fact that the Facial Action Coding System simply does what da Vinci did countless years ago, but on a more accessible scale, this new technology is invaluable to students in today's society. ",4,7,0.7941955924034119

I think it would be a great idea to tell how people are feeling. Because someone might be having a bad day and you might not know, but if you could read facial expressions you would know. This computer than could tell you how Mona Lisa was feeling is a 3-D constructer computer. In oreder for it to detect a painting,Picture, or even an actual person's face Right now it has to have all 44 muscle movements of a human. the only thing i'd change about this experiment is instead of making everything nowadays computerized and robotic why dont we do this with paper and pencil, collect data and figure it out,if it doesn't work on the first try then change your hypothnose and do the experiment all over again.

My final conclusion is that decoding people's facial expressions is pretty neat. It gives us a look at the past and present day of people's reactions and expressions. They also told us how to look in the mirror and dot eh 3 steps by yourself and see if you can decode your own facial expression.

Its not good to keep emotions bottled up for a long time it will eventually get to you. But with the help of this machine if you use it on someone and there not okay you can genuinely help them or you can get some help for them yourself. For an example if something is happening at home and they become all sad and depressed and wont tell anyone why theyre feeling what they are feeling. And no one has a clue you can use the machine to help figure it out and get them the help that they properly need wether if its they need someone to talk to about troubles or if they actually need to go see a doctor to check and see if they have something wrong with them.

One downside to this machine is that. What if they get the emotions wrong? Out of all the emotions the machine is bound to get one wrong because so many people feel like so many differnt things and there is a chance to get the feelings wrong.

On the other hand we dont know how many types of emotions there are listed within the machine there could be almost all emotions plugged into it.

A computer constucts a 3-D computer model of a face and there are ""action units"" which are one or muscles moving, the action unit is the associated with 6 different basic emotions and it lets you see the emotions going on from just detecting the moving muscles on the face. I believe that this new form of technology is valuable when it comes to reading the emotional expressions of students.

FACS could be the start of a lot more important and beneficial technology in the future. This new technology could be either very valueable or not valueable at all. I believe it will end up being very valuable in the future because it will help computers understand emotions and will help students and there education. Some students hide there emotions and thoughts on the way they are being taught even when it isnt beneficial and helpful for them. Everyone can have different preferences on how they are taught and FACS could let the computer know how the student feels about it, """"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"""" stated Dr. Huang which helps understand that the way the lesson is being taught can be changed by the computers because it can read the emotions of the students and will change the lesson in the prefernence of the students which allows them to benefit more.

Therefore I believe the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable at all because the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto does indicate that the technology is made specifically for photos and it sounds unecessary and a waste of energy to be used in real life.",3,7,0.854658842086792

3514f75,"What's your opinion on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)? If people used this system, it wouldn't be right. This might seem like a good and helpful system but if we start using it, it'll more likely upset people because not everyone is comfortable with others knowing their emotions, if everyone knows others emotions then we won't have to communicate as much because we have a machine that'll tell us, and jobs will be taken away because we will no longer need them.

Yes, this system would be quite interesting, but many people wouldn't agree with always having others know how they're feeling. They want to keep to theirselves and just think their emotions through, they shouldn't have to share them if they don't want to. In the passage, it says, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" At this point, you'd ask if she is okay. If she doesn't want you to know then she won't tell you so she shouldn't have to. If she does want to talk about it or tell you how she's feeling then she will. The person should always have an option as to whether or not people figure out how they're feeling.

Imagine the person next to you, in this case a girl, is sitting there just staring off into space, you would probably ask them what she is thinking about. If we use this system, then we won't have to ask because we'll already know if she's angry. If you already know she's angry then you wouldn't go up and talk to her, meaning we'd lose communication and that person would lose someone to talk to her emotions about (if she wanted to). In the article, it says, ""Eckman has classified the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" This shows that the computer will be able to detect the emotion that person is feeling so you won't have to.

In society today, we shouldn't use this system. Maybe if it was back in the day then it would be more beneficial because we didn't have as many therapists to help but now we have occupations that help us figure out how and why we're feeling certain emotions. As an example, imagine yourself as a therapist. If you're a therapist, you'd have multiple patients coming in your room on a regular basis to talk about how they're feeling, how their day was, etc. and you'd help them figure out why they're feeling happy, depressed, sad, angry, etc. The next day you look on the news and there's a new kind of computer that tells you how you're feeling, but that's your job. When you go into work, only half of your usual patients come in and the next day, the amount splits in half again. Sooner or later, you're down to very few patients but you aren't getting paid enough anymore so you have to quit and find another occupation. This is what would happen to many therapists and occupations similar because the people have a different way of seeing their emotions now.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is not a good idea. This system would make society more anti-social. We should work on finding more ways for people to come together and communicate with each other and this would do the opposite. It would make the people who do not want everyone to know their emotions upset/angry, it would make us lose communication, and some of our occupations would be lost.

351f9f9,"The use of (FACS) or Facial Action Coding System in the world of technology in computer programing should be enabled to the world around us. We know that today we live in a society of emotions, those emotions are expressed through our facial recognition. Often these true emotions are hidden away from society because of other needs meaning to be met. Political faces for example are an example of how the FACS can be used to others advantagese. As shown in the selection to support my claim ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". This piece of literature is a Non Fiction article due to its not being fantasy or made up. The author uses the Inductive approach to keep readers interested in what he has to say. This article will most likely follow the path of Logos because of its statistical history.

Society doesn't need to be lied to because the political results of that can damage many. Having FACS can stop politicians in lieing and give statistical evidedence to the public. Such things as ""But in a fake smile, the mouth the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risouris"".

A benefit of knowing this simple strategy can make a differnece in how you precieve someone or how you deal with a situation. For example the police force can widely benefit too, because of their crime investigators and interogates. When interrogating the suspect not only will FACS can find out if their lieing but also the amount of time spent one one case. The author gives us the tone of curiousness and innovation to the audience by saying ""Hold on! Can we actually 'calculate' emotions- like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" The way the words are semantically and syntactiaclly correct is giving the choice of the article. Also when the author asks questions to the audience it brings involvence to the appeal to the audiences attention.

When taking the famous painting of Mona Lisa as an example her expression is blank to the viewing public. No one knows how she actually felt at the time of the painting besides her and the painter Da Vinci. The FACS has been a great accomplishment for the two professors attending Illinois University and the Amsterdam University. The two professors Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe have come up with this wonderful cnocept. This doesn't only qualify when telling someone is lieing bu the use of everyday life and advancements in eduacation.

When talking about the advancement of eduaction usually facial expression recognition isn't in the topic. But with FACS education can be advanced to a whole new level through computers. Supporting my claim is what Dr. Huang has stated himself "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This would be extremly helpful to learning because of the expressions we make technology can advance to benefit us in more ways than one. Including this statement of ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" this gives a reason as to why there should be no reason to fear the computer. It will only be there to help assisst in your eductaional aid.

Using FACS can be very helpful to phsycologist that talk to kids and adults about their situations. When there are menatlly disabled or situations where the reaction is showing mixed results there can be an advancement in the phsycology industry. Given the situation facial recognition can advance with computers to give life a new meaning. I do believe the technology to allow the emotional expressions of students in a classroom should be enabled. There are and can be so many new possibilites for this in every country around the world. Not only for medical or educational reasons but for daily use at the work place, meetings, schools and even a psych ward.

This program can read by muscles so it can help us if we have painting and we need analys that. It has classifield six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. If we raise our eyebrows then we are surprised. This system can mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece. It says we can probably tell how our friend is feeling by the look on her/his face, but it is not always true. I think everybody had experience when she/he was smiling but she/he was sad inside. And I think this program can not read this if we are similing but we are sad inside. It says the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. It could be good if the students bored or confused but a computer never being a human. In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth and it was instruction #1. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around eyes. It was instructions #2. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Faces do not lie. The emotionals very important in our life. If our friend is sad but if we are positive and we are smiling than maybe he/she will smile.

Computers can give out wrong data, for example, if you would determine to search something up for a project and it came up with different websites,(different websites can give different answers) like Wikipedia, it could give you a wrong answer and then you would ask your teacher or professor if your data seemed right he/she would be like "" This is not the right information"" then pulls out a book determining the answer to your question that gives the right information you need to complete your project.

A 3-D computer does 44 majot muscles to see what you are feeling. People are making a comupter to recognatioin to track the emotions on a person face.

Does a computer read your emotions and yes it does because it is wired. The computer has came a long way and now it is reading emotions. This is how I am against technology reading childrens emotion.

35fea99,"Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a computer technology that read the emotional expressions of students. The technology show be in classroom because how would we know if something wrong with a students if she does not show it or tell it. Many students do not show there feeling in school because the are afriad. Especially around there frined because the dont want there friends to see there emotional side of them. FACS should be in classroom because we need to know how if you and a good or bad mood, counselor, and if your getting bully and your not happy about it.

Classroms should have the Facial Action Coding System so the teacher can know if you are in a good or bad mood because some people dont show it. Teachers need to know how their students are feeling because they might call on them in class to answer a qusetion not knowing that the student is in a bad to answer the quwstion. In the text it states,"" Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This quote support my answer because its hard to tell if a person upset or need time to be alone so he or she can cool down. Having a FACS computer in classroom will really help teahers know if there something upsetting there students.

Having a Facial Action Coding System in classrom would help conselor know if you go to there office and your not showing no emotion but your upset about something. The technogly can be helpful to many school because teachers do not know whats going on with there students because they dont show it or try to talk to somebody about it. In the text it states,""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitae another person's facial epressions. Whoever thought that amking faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!."" This quote support my answer because it can show how your real feeling behind their smile.

This technogly could help students that are getting bully and are afriad to speak up and tell a teacher. Students that get bully everyday at school are most likely do not tell nobody that they are getting bully because they are afriad of the person that are doing the mean things to the student. Having the Facial Action Coding System can help the student that getting bully seek out help before it gets worse then it already is. In the text it states,""But in a false smile, the mout is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. to an expect, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are something used to spot when a ""smiling"" politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This quote supports my quote because it can help a teacher know if her or his student is upset about something and he or she can ask the student so it he be stop.

Facial Action Coding System should be in school because it can be helpful for teachers to know if your in a good or bad mood , letting your counsoler if you upset about something, and also if your getting bully. This technolgy is a great way to know if something going on at home. Many student would proabbly ant this kind of computer because they would be scared to tell somebody how they are feeling. Students are not just going to be emotional in front of there classmate because when there friend ask whats wrong with them it make it harder to tell somebody how your feeling.

Also, this tech could help identify whether a person is telling the truth or not. We could us thhis tech in legal debates or court cases just as much as in the school for experiments. This tech puts on a whole new meaning to body lannguage.

One way it could be used,asi said n the intro, is in legal debates. In the artical, it states that the software can detect if the face you make is forced or an actual smile/frown. This means we can see if a politician is lying about his/her claims during a debate. Not only that, but the software also comes up with a percentage of each emotion on one expresion. This new software can revolutionize the way we see expresion.

We could also use this technoligy to identify wether or not a person is depressed or not felling well. As i said in the paragragh before, the software uses percentiges to identify how sad, angery, or happy a person is. So, if we used this on someone who looked aas if they are depressed, we simple use the software to calculate the differences. In this way, saving many people from suicide and therefor, helping them as well.

In conclusion, this software will revolutionize the way facial expresion are reconized. It will help so many people in so many different ways. But this, this is just the begining of our technological advancment in life. Soon, we might even cure magor disesis.        ",3,7,0.7129396200180054

That is why I am for this idea, this is easily the next step to creating a robot that acts like a human! The sheer amount of other possible uses are nearly endless!

Tired of watching and seeing the same add you don't like? This can fix the problem! the platform running the video (for example, youtube) could find out how much you liked the add before and after, using this information, they can write an algorithem to see what ads you like and don't like and see. Running a school filled with computers? Have the lesson teach itself by keeping the student entertained! As said by dr. Huang ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

Hospitals could use emotion to check how a patient is feeling. if they're sad the camera will tell them. are they in pain? the camera can tell them. The knowledge of emotion just by seeing the patient's face in a camera reduces the need for nurses and allows a hospitel to hold more patients. maybe in the far future, we could have medical assistants, like baymax from big hero six, who could act as an automated doctor or nurse. need an example? in december of 2017 the flu broke out killing more then 500 people, if hospitals would've had more room, it could saved 80% of the people who died from the flu that year.

The sheer amount of uses are too vast! Ads could finnally maintain revelancy. Teachers could be replaced by good programmers, hospitals could save more lives than ever! I feel that the downsides, if any, Are complete obsolete when compared to the upside. I think we all should focus on the study of emotion and learn how much it can help. ",3,7,0.7725321650505066
3644611,"Imagine someone that is so familiar with a friend or loved one that they can tell what emotion they're feeling without having to say anything at all. Better yet, imagine if something was this smart. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author, Nick D'Alto, tells the readers about a new technology created to read the emotional cues from a human to further the communicable relationship between computers and humans alike. This technology, created by Professor Thomas Huang, ""calculates"" the emotions displayed on the face of the user of the computer, and was said to encourage learning and help the boredom and other emotions often felt by humans when learning. Later on in the article, D'Alto writes about how helpful this superior technology would be in the classroom and other learning environments, compared to the average computer used in schools all around the world. The technology described in the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" that reads the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable to learners all over the world and should be used in modern-day schools.

The advanced technology recently created to read the emotions of the user, and impact the way they learn in the classroom is helpful and valuable. This is shown throughout the article by describing how the technology works and how it can be used to locate the emotions on the users' face. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can track these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa,"" (Paragraph 4). This quote describes to the reader the advancements of this technology, and just how unique the technology is in its intelligence. ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc... His [Dr. Huang] new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code,"" (Paragraph 5). This quote is helpful in giving the reader more information about how advanced this technology is, and how superior it is to even the skill of humans. Together, these quotes show that the technology would ultimately be more valuable in the classroom for the use of students.

One may even ask, ""How would this technology helps students?"" The answer to that very question lies in the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" This special software is very important to students because it could very well increase their chances of success in the classroom. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" (Paragraph 6). This quote gives the reader more information about how helpful this computer software could be in a learning environment, by being able to keep the learner's attention on the knowledge they are consuming. Another quote, from paragraph 6, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad will follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This quote explains more examples of the skills of the computer technology, and gives the reader an idea about how students can use these basic, yet complicated tools to their advantage in the classroom.

This great technology can be so helpful to students, teachers, and employees in almost all kinds of learning environments by being able to give each and every person the best kind of learning session that they need. The technoloical devices at schools in this day and age just seem inferior to the kind of learning one can get via this advanced software created by Dr. Huang. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" (Paragraph 7). This quote shows evidence in the comparison between regular technology and the unique technology that is created for the use of learning in a classroom. Another quote from the article, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,"" (Paragraph 8), tells the readers that there are signs of false emotions and real emotions. These signs are easily caught by the technology software, and used to make learning easy and fun in the classroom, which can be extremely beneficial in the long run for school systems and teachers.

Technology these days can be used for both good or bad things, and often, technology is used for both. But a technology that is so helpful for learning and other school things is good, and needs to be used in order to improve a learning environment. The technology software that can read human emotion, and from there, improve the knowledge a student consumes is so very important and valuable. That's why this superior and advanced technology is valuable to students and school systems all over the world. ",5,7,0.7870379686355591
366ba9d,"I think that emotion calculating technology in a classroom could be very valuable. This technology could help teachers to keep students interested. This could also help to teach students in a way that they enjoy and understand. An advanced technology like this could also help teachers and counselors to know when a student is feeling sad or depressed so that they can possibly help the student. This technology would be very valuable in any classroom, it could be the innovation that every classroom needs.

The FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) works by looking at the 44 major facial muscles. Every different facial muscle movement means something different, and this is what the FACS looks at to give a reading of the different emotions that the person is feeling. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. The FACS machine was invented by Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science. Dr. Huang relies on human psychologists like Dr. Paul Eckman to help decifer the expressions that facial muscles give. Dr. Huang used this technology on Mona Lisa. The readings said that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Using this technology on Mona Lisa is a prime example of how this technology can accurately measure a persons emotions.

This technology could be useful in a classroom in many ways. One way it would be useful, it could measure a students emotions to find out when a student is bored of a subject. This would be useful because if teachers know when a student is bored they could help to make the subject more interesting. Making subjects more interesting in return would raise students grades and happiness in school. This technology could also help counselors. This technology could help counselors by showing themwhen a student is sad or depressed so that they can help the student and also try to fix the problem causing those emotions.

Facial expression reading technology would help classrooms in many ways. This technology could potentially raise student's grades and even help to make students happier. This technology could also make students happier and help then to stay interested and having fun while learning. This advanced technology would be very beneficial to a classroom, it could even change the world of education all together. ",2,7,0.8668147325515747
369b6c2,"The technology of "" Facial Action Coding System"" should not be used to read students emotions to read in a class room and the use of this technology is not valueable. Why? because no student would want to let a machine tell what their emotions are and what they are feeling. In the text it says that this technology can calculate when your face is sad, happy, angry, scared, bored.

This technology won't be able to detect all the movements of the face and detect what our feelings show threw a smile we put on our face .

Not all technology work well and if this technology were to detect a humans feelings trew their face it wouldn't work because not all tecnology work well and everyones face is different. How would you be able to detect a older humans face and a younger humans face?, not all technology would be able to calculate that and this technology will possibly pick up the wrong feeling the person makes. The person might feel sad but their face might show a bit of anger or a person might be feeling calm and relaxed but the technology might pick up that the humans face might be angry . You might be able to tell a persons feelings their the face they make, because maybe this person might be your friend and you know what faces they make when they are worried or mad or sad. Not this technology especially if it has never detected a new before and every single persons face is different. My opinion to this is this technology would not be a very good idea especially if a technology knows more about your feelings then you do. Some people might put on a happy face to show others that they are okay and nothing is bothering them but inside they might be in trouble or worried.

Many people hide their feelings/emotions so no one can make such a big deal out of them. ",3,7,0.8768110275268555

There's are several of reasons why It's a good idea to use this genuis technique in class.

To start off It's pretty incrible that a computer can see what emotion you are feeling. Why not use it? It'll come in pretty handy. Let's just say that a student In the class is never doing their work. They're constantly distracted and they don't show any effort. The computer can tell us what emotion the student is feeling so then that way It'll not only be helpful for the teacher to know what's going on but it'll also be helpful to the student so that the teacher helps the student not to struggle so much.

It can also help with students that are confused and aren't sure how they are feeling or mayeb they feel a lot of things at once which is very confusing a computer than can show what your feeling is a good tool. It can help you firgure out what your feeling In cas you don't know how you feel.

Same with teachers. Students can firgure out what their teacher is feeling that way they can avoid getting into trouble. If they see a teachers angry they wouldn't wanna make them more mad.

As in for students. With this cool technology it can help students find out what's going on in case they have a friend who they're worried about and they're not so sure what's going on with their friend. Well this computer can quickly help you figure out what's going on with them. Im sure your friend would really appriciate that you help them out even if it seems like they don't.

These are the reasons I think that using this computer that show what emotions you've got is simply very helpful to both students and teachers. It's a smart way in not only showing how you feel but also producing them. ",3,7,0.8866181969642639

They should do one in a classroom to see if the kids are bored and what time they get bored and intertainded.

This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. Students would benefit from this technology because the FACS would know if they were bored or confused, modify the lesson like a real teacher, and help the student understand the lesson better and earn a good grade as a result.

The FACS would know if the student was bored or confused because it constructs a detailed 3D image of the face with all 44 major muscles.

It then compares the image to the image of a neutral face with no emotion and looks at certain muscles.

The computer looks at the ""zygomatic major,"" for example, to see if you are smiling genuinally becasue the corners of your mouth would be pulled back.

It would also look for your ""frontalis pars lateralis"" to tell if you are suprised by something because your eyebrows would be raised.

The FACS would also be able to measure exactly how many emotions you have because the technology ""weighs different units.""

If a student was bored or confused the FACS would be able to modify the lesson; therefore, helping the student understand the lesson more.

The computer now would not know if the student was having trouble becasue it can not see what the student's face look like.

But with the help of the FACS, the computer knows what the student is feeliing and can change what the lesson is about to help the student.

Just like a real teacher, the FACS would know what the student was thinking and be able to change how the lesson was worded to hopefully help the student understand what it was saying.

The Faical Action Coding System would be able to modify the lesson just like an experienced and effective teacher would.

With the Facial Action Coding System modifying the lesson, the student would earn a better grade as a result than if the lesson was not modified.

The student would most likely do better on both the homework and the test because the lesson was reworded in a much more impactful way than it was originally.

If the student does better on the homework and test, then the overall grade would increase, as well as the percentage of passing grades for the class.

The FACS would modify the lesson; thereby increasing the amount of passing students and helping the school earn a better grade from the Department of Education.

The FACS would be able to see if a student was confused or bored, and if he or she is bored or confused, modify the lesson accordingly; therefore, increasing the overall grade the student received.

The Facial Action Coding System would be able to help the student if he or she was confused by rewording the lesson iin the way the student would understand better.

A person can feel many emotions at once or just one very specific emotion because humans are emotional people, especially students. School can be stressful to many people and that's okay, but certain technology may not solve that problem. The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom is not valuable because, students can become distracted, the technology may scan the wrong emotions, and it is an invasion of privacy.

Student can become distracted in the classrooom by the Facial Action Coding System. Students can begin to make silly faces in the camera or try to display different emotions to see what happens to the lesson they are doing. The article states that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The student may take advantage of the software to get a modified lesson that may be easier than what they are capable of. While there are student that would not take advantage of the opportunity to have such technology in the classrom, there are always the rebel students that will take advantage. If a student is not getting the work that they are capable of doing their learning will come to a hault and they will not get the benifits they should, compared to a human intructor. Human instructors can possibly be a better tool to use rather than the FACS.

The Facial Action Coding System may pick up the wrong emotions generating a more simple lesson. Like previosly stated, people can feel many emotions at once for many different reasons. The article states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions—happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness—and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The system may pick up emotions, but it was never said that it will be able to tell why you are feeling these emotions. A student maybe have other things running through their mind that may not have anything to do with the work they are completing. The system can pick up an emotion and modify the lesson. It would be a mere mistake but the mistake will obstruct the learning capabilities of the student.

The FACS may be an invasion of privacy to some people. The system would be constaly reading your facial expression, which students may be uncomforable with. There are many shy and quiet people because not everybody is very social and likes to be on camera. The article states, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""

A system that always watching you? The Facial Action Coding System sounds like something students can be uncomfortable with, considering that people tend to more private. Not every astudent will be so excited to hop right on the FACS train because they may see having a computer watching you as an invasion of their personal life.

The Facial Action Coding System may be helpful elsewhere, but it may not be something wonderful to have in the classroom. Technology seems to be flourishing throughout the years. The FACS doesn't seem valuable to have in the classroom. Students can be distracted, the system may not fuction properly, and it is an invasion of privacy.

The technology will create a 3-D computer model of the face being scanned. It will can the 44 major muscles in the human face. Muscles such as the frontalis pars lateralis muscle convays the emotion of being surprised, by raising the eyebrows. The human will convey many emotions at once, so by using video imagery, the software will be able to track the facial movements. The units created by the facial expressions will be compared to a face that show no emotions. But, humans can do the same emotions calculations on a regular basis by looking at a friend that is sad or mad, but it'd be difficult to explain the facial features being conveyed at certain time. A classroom computer will be able to scan a childs face and see if the student

is bored or

confused, then the computer would act like a human instructor and modify the lessons to make it easier or less-boring to the student.

Technology like this would be benefical to the classroom, because the computer can make certain school lessons less boring and more helpful to students that don't understand.

The program can make you happier overall and allow you to succeed in school. It states in the passage, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them."" This shows that smiling can help you become happier. The program is made to allow you to feel certain emotions and adjusts the program based on your feelings. For example, if you are getting bored with the work that the program is providing it can alter the work to what you can feel more comfortable with.

FACS is valuable because a computer program can know how you feel, adjust your program to meet your needs, and make you happier. If we had this program this would allow more students to feel better about our learning, leading us to learn more. Also allow us to enjoy viewing ads, movies, TV, etc.",4,7,0.8605626821517944

Making Mona Lisa Smile is made for computer imagery, when making of Mona Lisa Smile, The students are finding the ""computer construcs a 3-D computer model of the face."" the model of the computer move like the human muscles. Also the computer are smart as the human as, and computer tells the true. when the student's finding how is becoming to found the computer 3-D. they sloved the model and the founded. And useful in the world.. when you use 3-D model is look real life you seeing. Is beautiful to look at the imagine on the comuputer or video imagery.

Body of 2, Because the computer useful and how can the computer must do it well. The computer knows your feel happy or feel sad. for example, when the proson did bad things, the police offcial used the computer and they will find you on the computer imagine. And the computer can being to ceek your bones; also the computer are so smart. it will knews everthing; for example, when people's visit the other counrtys, at the ariport when before you going throught, it might have like gate. the gate are put in computer, when you go throught that gate the computer cheek your bodys and inside of your bones; and it'll cheek your bags.

body of 3,for example, When you have eyes problem,the first they took the picture, on computer, your imagine will shows up your eyes problem; and the doctor will cheek your eyes with computer. The computer's would know how your eyes will gonna work and how much far you sees; or you need glass, it'll shows on the imagine computer.

when you eyes cheeks would lay dawn your chin and you look at the green light and everythings the computer know about your eyes. for example, When people went to takephotos store, with their family to take family picture. After they took family picture; the carmerman ask about Adding the photos. And their family choces background, a beautiful picture, and the camerman add imagine on the computer. For the other example, when the US soldier's to fight war with Isis, before US Army's will fight their bad guys US Army's used small ariplan it have carmer, the Army's look at the place on the computer. After they look at on the computer, the Army's knews how many Isis people are there. And US captian let's go his soldier. to fight bad guys..

The author says ""For instance , you can porbably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking at her face."", the author is absouletly right , people show more emotion in their facial expressions then they think.. your face says it all.""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" It is so very improtanat that poeple feel that they can to anyone they trust with their emotions, emotions are something big that run through you 24/7. You can not stop emotions from coming and going.

38ddc8d,"I think that the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enableing the computers to identify human emotions is'nt valuable at all. Especially not for students in a classrom. I say this because students moods in a classroom can change, in a matter of seconds because the teacher may give out extra work or it was a hard day for the student. Also kids don't always show their emotions.

Let's get a little bit more into this. I'm not completly sure why this facial exspression system seem's like a good idea. Maybe because the people who thought about it thought it would be a smart and great idea to know peoples emotions. If you can already tell by ""facial"" exspressions why need this machine system? It would be a waste of money to make everywhere.

People may show their mood by their facial exspressions but others might not. Some don't even show their emotions. Others may even have that natural ""mean/angry"", ""happy/funny"", or even the ""sad/depressed"" facial look.

This is why I think it would'nt be much of a good idea. It costs to much and might not even be worth it.",2,7,0.8678653240203857
38ea253,"Before I get into whether or not FACS is a valuable tool in the classroom I ask you, is this valuable? Depending on how you're looking at it and who you are you could have many different opinions on this. FACS stands for Facial Action Coding System.

If you think about what this software is about, it is about reading a students facial expression to determine what it is. It's not impossible to do without this software. In what situation would you not be able to read a students expression that you needed to use a software to determine it for you? It says in paragraph 5 of the passage ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" It says in the passage that humans can still calculate their emotions without this software.

I believe that this type of technology is completely useless and a waste of money if this were to be implemented into a classroom, that would be many uses and practical situational use for this software. The classroom is not one. If you were to implement it at a high college level course then it might be effective and worth the money but only if it effects that major that they are going into. If FACS implementation was thought about between kindergarten through 12th grade then there is a problem.

There is no practical use for this software anywhere between that grade level. You would never need to use this software for practical use in the school day. There is no gain from having student learn it before college because they most likely won't retain the informatio and even if they do it is most likely useless to them.

In conclusion, why implement this software that can change a photo or painings facial expression? It's complete and utterly useless for K-12th grade to learn about this software or even have hands on time with it. There is no practical field to go down with this. I see this FACS software as just a gimic that people who are interested will use for their own fun. So to answer the question, no. I think that this software is valuable but not in the classroom. This software would only be useful at a college level course or in a professional career like in a hospital.",4,7,0.7548243999481201

There's an expert name Dr. Huang, he developing ways for humans and computers communicate even though it's going to take some years. Until they finally finded out they can calculate emotions like math homwork but working with real humans.

The way this process work is to have the computer with 3-D contructs and a computer model of the face and have to build the human like human muscles which it's called ""action unit""

which made by Dr. Huag and Dr. paul Eckman, the creator of facts of ""facial action coding system"". during his own creation he knows the six basic emotions like happiness, surrise, anger, disguet, fear and sadness plus characteristic movements of that new computer model they making out of 3-D.

It says that when the computer model wakes up everyday it have the same impressive calculation so it really means it still acts the same from yesterday like saying when u have a friend that like being happy randomly from yesterday well your friend can still act the same the next day which you is wathing your temper, when Dr. Huang haves a computer soft where that stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

When you try to make computer models on your own at home wit a PC it might not work on yours ether way because you'll need a newer model of it so it can work it doesn't have enough storge to carry all tha data, so some people rarely take the long way which is writing it down for instruction that encode different emotions.

Even looking in a mirror you can look at yourself and see how you act with your emotions so you can make your own model and aftyer when you are done, you can tell your lab partners to test it out to see if it's really complete to make a fully computer model and that model will have the same emotions as you, plus not only you'll be happy about it you truely know how to reveal so much about the science of emotions.

The new talking emojis move the way the 44 face muscles do. What does the new computer software created by Prof. Thomas Huang do? It reads all 44 face muscles on the human body same thing as the iPhone X.

What if those percentages are wrong. Those percentages could not be real just by looking at the image she could of been happy. Those emotions are just identified by a computer, not all technology could be right. The computers/technology just identify but could be wrong by looking at the face of the image/picture they have used to dectect the emotion.

As in pargraph 3 it says, ""The process begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face"". Ther computer cops the face of the image and copys and make it 3-D. The expression is compared against a neutral face. The motion that is shown is showing no emotion at all which. The computer that they use shows wether the face is happy or sad.

The computers use calculation to show wether the face of the image is happy or sad. There is certain muscles in every face that make the bonestructor make it what you look like. There are six emotions that are used every day sad,mad,happy,scared,disgust,and susprised.

The FACS software works using the 44 major muscles in the human face to identify ""6 basic emotions; happiness, suprise,anger, disgust, fear,and sadness."" The computer will make ""a 3-D model of the face"" of all 44 major muscles. Then as the actual person moves their face the program will measure the emotion they are showing.

3978930,"My thoughts on the "" Facial Action Coding Sytems"" is that it may work but it also may not work cause we can't always count on technology to tell us if it's right or wrong, or true or false. The "" Facial Action Coding System"" is supposed to tell the reader how you feel with percentages on happiness, sadness, madness and even fear and depression.

We dont really need this machine cause it can put out false information to see how you really feel. Say you are actually really happy and you arent sad at all but then you go to the machine and it tells you that you are 70% mad, 15% sad 10% fearful, and 5% happy. That is putting out false information on how you really feel because you feel happy.

When you look at someone you can usually tell how someone is feeling by there facial gestures. We don't need the ""Facial Action Coding System"" to tell us how someone is really feeling and most of the time if you ask how someone is feeling they will tell you they will be straight up with you. They will behappy that someone actually cares enough to know how they feel.

Personally i don't think we need the ""Facial Action Coding System"" because that is a waste of money and research. Why would we do research on something that we can go up to someone and ask them how they are feeling we dont need percentages or anything to wild we just need a simple answer like ""i'm fine how about you?"" or "" I'm good how about yourself?"" or "" I'm fantastic, How are you feeling on this wonderful day?""

I think it is a waste of money to do research on something we can do in person when we ask someone how they are feelig today. You just have to ne polite and nice when you ask someone on how they are feeling. Just cause the "" Facial Action Coding System"" tells you the persentages on how you fell doesnt mean anything because for all we know it can be false and it can produce false information on how you are feeling so to end this off i don't think we need the "" Facial Action Coding System"".",3,7,0.8070637583732605
398af51,"Human emotion, once about feelings and expression, can now be calculated and recognized by a computer, as if it were a math problem. As stated in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, there is a new technology created by Prof. Thomas Huang, as a way to improve the relationship between computers and humans. Meaning, ads and websites would be able to assess the user and adjust what is shown, depending on the emotions of the human. The example given in the article is""... if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screan, a smiliar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto 6). Not only is this device useful in the world of marketing, but may also be of use in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would have great value in the way teachers and students communicate,as a way to improve the education of students and the way teachers teach. Though there are many pros and cons in this given situation, if done right, this device could help students greatly.

To begin, the use of FACS would be a wonderful way to help students and teachers communicate indirectly. This would be done through a computer that could analyze the movement of the muscles in the face to identify the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, disgust, fear, and sadness. In a classroom setting, whether it be during an assignment or lecture, teachers would be able to use FACS to read the emotional response of the students to help determine their thoughts on the given subject. This could allow teachers to improve and change the way they do things, in order to better the students educational experience. In addition, this technology could be utilized to keep students honest in the classroom, expecially on assignments and tests. The complexity of FACS is able to read mixed emotions, which would allow teachers to build an understanding on their students, and help the teachers find a way to relate to the students. Also, a conselor may also be able to help students more effieciently with the use of this device. They would be able to read the emotions of students to help them determine the mental and emotional state of a students. Though all of these pros seem good on paper, there are also many cons that come with it.

Ultimately, it is quite clear that this device may seem intrusive to some people. As stated in the article, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements..."" (D'Alto 4), this technology would be able to use videos to track facial movements and determine how people feel. Some students may think that their rights are being violated with the use of FACS. Students may not want teachers to know how they feel, especially if the feeling is negative. However, D'Alto states, ""...we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day"" (D'Alto 5), meaning people naturally utilize the function of decoding emotion. It's most likely not that difficult to determine how someone feels. In current technology, there are fingerprint scans and facial recognition, that essentially have the same purpose. So, in the end, this device may not be as intrusive as people may think.

Overall, using the Facial Action Coding System would benefit many people within the school system. Teachers would be able to connect with students and determine whether their teaching methods are working or not. This would then improve the education that the students receive and result in a happier classroom environment and better grades. The FACS' understanding and analyzing of emotion may eventually lead to the improvement of education and the attitutes students have towards school.    ",4,7,0.8439358472824097

This is a fantastic device that can detect your exact emotions by creating a 3-D model of your face and analyze your muscle movements in your face to produce your emotions. This would be extremely useful in a classroom because the computer would show the teacher what the students are feeling and if the computer needs to change what is being discussed or not.

In a classroom, there are always a variety of expressions, mad, happy, upset, confused etc. Everyone is thinking something different about what they are learning. The text states that by using the Facial Action Coding System the teacher of the class could reference their ""computer and be able to know if they need to explain the material more clearly, discuss something more interesting, or continue with what is being taught at the moment."" This would allow the students to be more satifised with their school work and make them enjoy the material they are learning and comprehend it well.

On the other hand, sometimes people want their emotions to be private and do not want other people to know what they are thinking. The Facial Action Coding System is not something you have to have as a teacher. It is not required among the population, it is simply something you would want to have in a classroom. If the majority of the students want their emotions to be read for teaching purposes than the classroom should have the technology. If the majority does not want the device, they do not have to have it in the classroom and can go through their school days as usual. But, with this computer device all of the students would end up being satisfied because they are being taught what interests them and they would enjoy it.

Having the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom would detect the ""nonverbal communication"" throughout the classroom. It would process what the students opinion is on the discussion and turn it into their overall emotion. ""The Facial Action Coding System can physically change the lesson into something the students are interested in discussing.""

I could be frowning and be happy ,but showing a sign of joy. Don't always trust technology; it sometimes can lead in the wrong way. Im amuse that people are relying on technology to lead them in a direction that could be wrong.

In the article it said "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelging simply by the look on her face."" That's very incorrect because many times I'll ask my friend how she is feeling when she looks grumpy. She would say im good with me not knowing that because me thinking her facial expression is saying something different. People ask me all the time whats wrong with me when; I turn out to be just chilling. Some people natural look might just be a mug. I learned that the hard way its so very true.

Trusting technology can give you false information. I remember this time I sprained my foot. I went to the doctor to get in x-ray and the x-ray information was showing that nothing was wrong with it for a period of time. Although, im glad the doctor knew what he was doing ;he then figure out that the inner of my foot was spained. The bone was slightly bent and I needed time to heal it and recover. It sounds like the Facial Action Coding System is like a x-ray machine.

I understand that the Facial Action Coding System is a use of technology. With that being known we can believe that the technology want always be right. You can get stuff off the internet thats not true information, but yet it's a source of technology. Many people just go to get there information off of wikipedia for a research project. You never know if the stuff is true because any one can edit it. So you can compare the Facial Action Coding Sysytem with gettig information off of the internet these are both sources of technology.

Is it a possibility that the Facial Coding System is valuable? Yes but I wouldn't put all of my trust into it. Just because im frowning don't assume that something is wrong with me.

These are the things that makes the Facial Action Coding System useful.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or is happy or sad. If you smile when an ad pops up on your screen another similar ad might appear but, if an ad pops up and you frown then it won't have the same ad come up again. Because of this the students would be happier and cheerful. If a student was sad or bored when working on a lesson then it would change the lesson and make it more fun and then it would be more effective. This would make the children learn more and not dread being at school.

Using video imagery to recognize the facial emotion. This weights the different units of the face so that the software can identify mixed emotions. Because of this they can tell all of the different things the painting was feeling. Every expression is compared against a face that shows no emotion at all. This is so that they can know what to look for in the face and see the differences between a neutral face and a face with mixed emotions.

Humans perform the same calculations every day. Humans can tell if someone is sad or worried etc. by their facial expressions. Because of this we know peoples feelings sometimes. We would have trouble describing exactly what they were feeling just by looking at their face but, thats what the Facial Action Coding System does. This is saying that people can't tell exactly what other people are feeling just by their faces so that what the Facial System does.

The Facial Action Coding system does so many great things that would help schools and society.

Although fairly accurate at times, this software that detects emotions may not be always accurate. For example, according to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the software calculates that the woman in the famous painting ""Mona Lisa"" is ""2 percent angry."" This is likely untrue, and Leonardo da Vinci probably never intended this. She does not appear angry, and if anything, da Vinci simply could not recognize facial expressions well enough to accurately depict the emotions that he intended the subject of the painting to have. Additionally, the article states that there are six basic emotions the software can detect: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. These emotions are useful, but this also means the computer cannot detect emotions like guilt and confusion. These are very important emotions in the classroom, and the computer must be able to detect if a student cheats on a test or does not understand a concept. The software is very limited in detecting emotions, and this could lead to adverse consequenses.

Sometimes, not only are a person's emotions unclear, but the cause of a person's emotions may not be obvious given the current context, because people often live in the past. A student may appear to be confused, but only because the student does not understand a joke they heard before the lesson. The article says that the computer could recognize this confusion and modify the lesson, despite the fact that the student's confusion has nothing to do with the lesson in the first place. Also, if a student does not understand a certain part of the lesson material, the computer will not be able to detect the exact part; the student will be confused no matter what part it is. The computer will be forced to explain and clarify everything, when the student may only need a small part clarified. In a similar way, the student may still not understand the material afterwards, but the computer cannot ask the student why this is so, because it only detects the student's confusion.

While detecting emotions and their causes are important in the classroom, the most important thing is responding to them appropriately. For example, if a student is feeling sad, this will likely affect their retention of the material being taught. However, the computer likely cannot alleviate or eradicate this sadness, because it is most likely caused by an outside source. The computer may try to comfort the student, but the student will know that the computer does not actually feel any emotions and will not be comforted whatsoever. Additionally, the student may feel bored, but the computer may not be able to change this if the student feels that the material being taught is boring, because the computer has no choice but to teach this material to the student. As a result, even if the computer can detect a student's emotions, it may not be able to do much about them.

No matter how useful this emotion-reading software is, it should not be used in the classroom. It may falsely detect an emotion and change the lesson when unnecessary. It could also assume the wrong cause for an emotion, leading it to make a lesson longer or more thorough when the student understands it already. Additionally, the computer may detect emotions well, but it may not be able to fix them or change them, making the software pointless. Technology may have great benefits, but detecting emotions in the classroom is not one of them.",5,7,0.8555471897125244

says, ""The facial expressions for each are unviersal"". This technology will improve on how student will do in their class. The emotional expressions is valuble for students, becasue it already been tested, can determined fake emtions, and can help modify lessons.

Also, this technology has been tested on actors. The author states, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". This shows that Facial Action Coding System can work on anyone.

The Facial Action Coding System can determine fake emotions. The author states, ""But in a false smile, the mouth is strerched sidways"". The computer can exam the students face, and determine their real emotions. Students would not have to worry what emotion they have on thier face.

This technology will help improve the students acdemically. Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are unviersal"". For example a student looks confused it could take them forever or maybe never to finish the lesson, but the Facial Action coding system could change that. It could modify the lesson to help the student understand more and finish the lesson more quickly.

This technology is very valuble to have in a classroom. The students will be able to get more help and will not be confused as much anymore. They would not have to worry about the computer determing the wrong emotion. All schools should get the Facial Action Coding System.       ",3,7,0.8911826014518738

Computers in the classroom that have the capability to identify whether a student is actually paying attention and to when they are bored or uninterested, is something that I think is a good. Putting all this techonology to work that we have could be beneficial in the classroom.

The software can tell even by a painting how the person is feeling. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.""The software identified how the Mona Lisa was feeling just by detecting her muscles in the painting. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face..."" The software begins by taking a picture of your face and then constructing a 3-D model of it.

Next, the software takes a closer look at your face. ""...all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" The software constructs the 3-D model into your facial expression and then it runs it by the 6 basic emotions. "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness...""

Now, in the classroom this would be very beneficial. ""... we humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday.

Just by looking into the camera lense the conmputer software can identify how I am feeling. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then i could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". By using this software in a classroom the software can modify the activity to make it more fun for the students.

For now the software can only identify simple expressions but later on it should be able to do complex ones with new algorithms. ""Perhaps Dr. Huangs's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code!"" Since most of our communication is non-verbal communication, this software could be a big help in the classroom. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, So computers need to understand that too."" With technology rapidly expanding and getting bigger and smarter, it needs to understand how to recognize our human emotions and to better activities and such.

It might not necessarily be accurate but you'll be pretty close to right, but now you have the technology to be accurate. A persons face changes depending on how they feel and most people are able to detect what that emotion is whether its sad, mad, happy, etc.

Dr. Paul Eckman creator of the Facial Action Coding system (FACS) classified six basic emotions which is happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. FACS is a computer process that constructs a 3-D computer model of the face and all forty four major muscles.

Professor Thomas Huang of Beckaman Institute, in collaboration with his collague Proffesor Nicu Sebe University of Amsterdam, are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

As stated before i think the work being put in by these Proffesors and Dr. Paul Eckman is very valuable and should be taken into consideration as usable to determine facial expressions because of the statistics being provided in the article and the credibility of these men.

In most cases you have to give a little to get a little. Yes there are terrible things that could go wrong with this software, but I believe it's for the greater good.

In this article they share about the Facial Acting Coding System. They ask us if we agree with it or not. My answer would be yes, I think there is nothing wrong with it. My personal opinon is it is actually kind of cool. This can really help people out knowing others emotions.

The reason I think there isn't anything wrong with this is because I dont see its harming anything. When I said it could help people I was refering to when they said that it can show when someone is bored and that the teacher could try to make it less boring. If I was a teacher or I wondered hiow someone is I9 would want to use this.

Another reason this is helpful is that it can detect when someone is feeling down or mad or something else. When someone sees what it detected they can see if the student needs someone to talk to or help. When a teacher uses this and they see that the student is bored and not focus they could try to make it fun or do something at the moment and make the focus and awake.

This system can be compareded to peoples thoughts on what some are feeling. There are some people that can almost do the same as this. But this system can do it pretty fast and tell yus exactly everything. They say when you do this you move your muscles and whatever ones you usae can make you happy. Which I think is cool and smart.

In conclusion I totally agree with this. Almost everything I put is my feeling on this Facial Action Coding System. Overall I can say it can really help some people out and that it is very smart.

So, the computers are going to tell you what your emotions are and tell you the percent to how happy you are, or how disgusted, fearful, angry, and many more. The computers can calculate anyones emotion whenever they would like to know.

The computers are there for people when they want to know there emotions. Like when they are having a bad day and they want to see how sad they are. All they have to do is go to the computer to find out. If I had that computer I would most deffinetly go to it.

But since I don't have it I just figure it out on my own by just relaxing and minding my own business.

Whoever came up with the human emotion computer is very smart becasue you know how many people would go to that computer to see how upset or how angry they are.

3bcd4b3,"Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed. While some argue that this Facial Action Coding System is a step too far into an innovative future, the advanced program could benefit a multitude of areas.

Thomas Haung's new software would not only find useages in a classroom, but also in daily life. Granting teacher's access to their student's feelings could give teacher's insight on how well their concept's are grasping. To further prove the computer's effectiveness, Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" (D'Alto). In addition to assisting a classroom setting, enabling people to read other's emotions would be benefitial also. Reading into surroundings helps people grow. Knowing what feelings an individual possesses could compell someone to be more considerate or act accordingly to how that individual feels. With that in mind, this program could also strengthen relationships.

Although the Facial Coding Acting System invades privacy, lessons human interaction, and may not be completely accurate of human emotions, it ultimately serves to benefit. While privacy concerns are understandable, the possible results after the slight invasion could be more than worth it. An unfortunate day could be quickly turned around if people were aware of the circumstances. Without a situation being addressed, nothing can be fixed;the same goes for a person's emotional state. However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody's facial expression? Dr. Huang addresses this by introducing that the computer first constructs a 3-D model of the face, with all the muscles operating as a human's would. Dr. Huang also explains that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.

Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life.

Well now you can thanks to the new technology called ""the Facial Action Coding System"", which detects facial emotions. I feel that we need this technology in our schools to help students actually get what they are being taught. This new technology can detect weather the child is into what they are learning or if they are bored and can change the subject depending on his or her's emotion.

Not every student has the same intrests, for example on kid might love football while his bestfriend loves horseback riding. This is the same thing as school subjects, and how students learn way different. We need this new technology in schools to help kids learn in the way they want to learn it. This is now possible because of ""the Facial Action Coding System"".

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the Facical Action Coding System was able to detect emotions on the Mona Lisa painting. Mona lisa was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. How does it know all this? With a 3-D structure of the face the model of the face the 44 muscles of the face must move like human muscles. This information is in paragraph 3. After the computer has scanned the model they rely on a psychologist to figure out the rest based on the expression of the face.

Alot of things can be detected by facial expressions, and it can help us understand why people act they way they do or feel the way they do. Like i said as for students if it can detect wether they are happy or bored with the lesson it can also change the question that doesnt make them bored so they actually like learning.

This is why i think all schools need the Facial Action Coding System because it can help students learn more in the classroom without having to learn about stuff they arent really into. This technology also gives them a chance to learn subjects in the way they understand learning it. Hopefully one day the new technology the Facial Action Coding System will be in schools helping students learn they way they need to. We have the technology we might as well take advantage of it!

There are plenty of supporting examples that you can use wheter you are for or against it. For me I do not like the use of this technology.

I do not like the idea of the use of this technology. For one reason this could be way inncorect and give you false information. It is most likely that this technolgy will not be all the way correct. Based on looks you cannot tell what percent is sad, angry,happy, or fearful. Also, like the passage said in paragraph seven the steps ""While looking in the mirror."" Just one slight expression on your face can change the percents. So, if you smile and your not happy there will be more percent happy than you really are. Many people cover up sadness or being angry by smiling. So if they smile the technology will be incorrect. That smile could change a lot of the percents. The only one who knows how happy, angry, or sad you are is yourself. You may be able to cover up all the sadness in your life by smiling and not being down, even though you really are.

Therefore thoes are just a few of my reasons that I don't like the technology. One expression could change how the results come back. Also, there is no way the test could be all the way correct.

I believe this new software is not as vaulable as it seems in the article for it to be in a classroom.

In my opinion, i think the Facial Action Coding System is not as valuable as it sounds as described on the article. If a teacher really wants to know the emotions of a student then just ask the student, using the new software on someone is not necessary.

In paragraph 6 it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"", a computer analyzing your face to know your emotions without the permission of the student is kind of invasion of privacy. What if the student doesn't want the computer to recognize what the student is feeling. Also why have a computer teach a lesson when

for many years the teacher is always the one teaching in front of the class. If a student is confused, that student can just raise their hand and have the teacher help them right there or what if the student has a question, the Facial System is not going to know that the student has a question because it only recognizes emotion, it doesn't read your mind. Either way the emotions of a student is not going to matter when your learning, its not important to know someones emotion, the only thing that matters in a classroom is for the students to pay attention and learn from the teacher.

The Facial Action Coding System is also a waste of the schools money. In the short paragraph before the first paragraph it says, ""...applications for a variety of industries."" meaning that the people who made the software are of course selling the system to other industries. So that means they are also going to sell the system to the schools which im sure is a lot of money. Instead of schools wasting the money on that system they could be using that money for better lunches, computers, ipads, prom, etc.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding system is not as valuable as it seems to be in the artical to be put in classroom computers. The new software is neither important nor necessary. The only important thing in a classroom is that the students pay attention and learn.

The argument talks about if the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable or not. The technology will idnetify what the students behavior is like. If a student doesn't want to show what they are feeling, the technology will solve it out. Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.

I think this technology is not valuable in a student's classroom. The student's emotional expressions will be easy to find out what they are feeling because it's in person. Mona Lisa painting needed the technolgy because no one knows what she is feeling like. This technology will be good use for paintings, pictures, etc, that it can't be expressed. The technology should only be used for educational purposes, not to find out what the student is feeling in daily. It is easy to see a genunie smile and a fake one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. ",2,7,0.9373845458030701

With the new software, the Facial Action Coding System, we can advance in so many ways with the way our lives function. Our computers could be able to detect what we like and what we don't, that way we can view only what we do like and not have to view what we dislike. In Paragraph 6, D'Alto demontstraits what could become of our technology, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" The new software could change our everyday lives and help simplify them as well.

Along with helping us with technology at home, it'd be able to make our school lives easier. In Paragraph 6, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."" This new software could be compared to someone is able to tell how their friend is feeling. Dr, Huang believes that this could even be a new electronic code, meantioned in Paragraph 5, ""His new computer software stored similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code""!""

If all of our computures could read our emotions, we could comunicate with our computers without a problem. In Paragraph 4, it's explained by Dr. Huang how that could be even remodely possible, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighing the different units,the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in the da Vinci's masterpiece).""

The science of emotions have revealed so much about people's expressions. Drama classes use facial expressions to imitate certain emotions when acting to make it look as realistic as possible. In Paragraph 9, a coach uses the technique to instuct actors, ""A renowned dram coach,Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" With the help of the Facial Action Coding System students will be able to complish more and make better technological generations in the future.",3,7,0.8352777361869812
3e1b6ab,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lsia Smile,"" written by Nick D'Alto, there is a new technology being introduced to the world called the Facial Action Coding system, otherwise known as ""FACS"". Essentially, this technology allows people to calculate the exact percentage of the emotions presented in one's facial expression by studying the placement of there facial muscles. The machine analyzes your face in search of six particular emotions, sadness, anger, surprise, happiness, fear, and disgust.

Now with the availability of a technology such as this schools are suggesting that the ""FACS"" machine should be placed in classrooms. Although, Many people believe the tool is invasive, there are many reasons that prove a system like this in the classroom can be very useful.

All in all, the amount of time and effort that it would take to take a simple scan is a trivial expense to the reults you can get from it. The main reason is revealed in paragraph 6, the author explains, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", this qouted by Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institutefor Advanced Science. He explains that this device could help teachers better their educational skills in the classroom. When the technology fully analyzes the emotions of a student it is a way of giving feedback to teachers regarding the way a lesson beign taught is received.

In concluson, The ""FACS"" technology is a helpful sourece in the classroom because it is a way to better connect the faculty and the students without presenting any conflicts. This technology will also further the effectivity of a child's education.",3,7,0.8969361782073975
3e837e8,"Technology in our modern society is always progressing. Since a lot of human emotions can be conveyed through facial expressions, scientists wanted a way fo develop a better communication between humans and computers. Every single day, people read each other's emotions based on facial expressions. Recently, a new software program was developed so that computers are now able to read people's emotions. This new software program is called the Facial Action Coding System.

The Facial Action Coding System works by monitoring the 44 major muscles in a human face and making a 3D computer version of the face. When one muscle moves, the computer detects the movement compared to a neutral expression. The computer then classifies it using the movement and its associated emotion into the basic emotions. In this way, the computer is able to then identify mixed emotions. Since facial emotions are universal, this type of technology can be used all around the world in many different ways, one example being in the classroom.

Emotional recognition in the classroom can be very useful in order keep students engaged in their lessons. Many times, students become disinterested, confused, or bored during the lesson, but according to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, this technology can ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Recognizing this problem can then ""modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(D'Alto). By modifying the lesson to better fit the student's needs, the computer can teach the students more effectively. This means that the students will be able to learn the material better and therefore be better as students and smarter as people.

This use of the new software technology, Facial Action Coding System, is valuable because it helps communication between the student and the computer. This communication promotes a better learning environment because the computer can teach a better lesson, if it recognizes the student is confused or bored. By modifying the lesson to fit the student's needs, students are able to better comprehend and be engaged in the material. This results in the students being more likely to apply what they have learned to their daily lives. Real life application shows true understanding of material, which in turn shows that students are becoming smarter due to enhanced and personalized lessons. This technology benefits the students by giving them a better suiting education for them so they can learn in the type of environment that will help them the most. This technology can also help teachers to understand the best way in which to teach their students the lesson in order to keep them engaged and learning in a healthy and beneficial environment.

In conclusion, the new software technology, Facial Action Coding System is able to track facial muscle movement. Then, it classifies the movement into emotions so that computers can recognize the emotions of people. Thie technology can be used in the classroom to futher engage the student and teach better lessons based on their current emotions towards the lesson. Therefore, it is a valuable asset to students if used correctly because it can help students to learn better by interesting them.    ",4,7,0.9126512408256531

In the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article they could find the percent of emtion the artist was feeling just by the way the picture was painted. Do you think its okay to use this sysem in a school setting?

I think its okay to use it in a school setting because it can see the true emotions the students feel. ""For instance, you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble acually decribing each facial trate that conveys happy"" I thinks its a good idea to have because, some kids really suffer from deppersion and sadness and this computer program can help them get the help they need and to be happy again.

Next, what the computers can do is crazy, they can read your emotional expressions when you are trying to hide them. ""Using video imagery, the new emotions-recognition software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or in painted face of Mona Lisa."" These computers can read everyones exact emotions.

This coding system could help many schools and students in many diffrent ways. This device could be in the schools psychologists office or in the schools guidence office and the kids could go there to get there face expressions done once a month and if it keeps comig back sad then they could go get the help they need to be happy.

In conclusion I am all for the use of this technology in a school setting. It can help each indivitual in a diffrent way. If someone is feeling sad or deppressed and dosent want to tell anyone then the Facial Action Coding System could help them be happy again. ",3,7,0.8779647946357727
3ead430,"Dr. haung and his colleagues are creators of the FACS (Facial Action Coding System). They are from the University of Illinois. The FACS is a system that can detect different emotions from a persons facial expressions. This system is on a computer and it can identify if a person is happy or sad and many other emotions. The way the system can tell is by indentify the different muscles used for each facial expression.

This idea is very interesting to me. I find that the system has positives and negatives. Also there is nothing out in the world right now like it. I think that the FACS could be very helpful in some ways. The system can work in schools which would help the teachers know who is needing help and who isnt understanding the subject. It can also show what students might be feeling like that day and if a person should be trying to make their day better.

The sytsem can also help others know when someone could be depressed. Then the person could get the help they need right way and get it before it is to late. I also think this could help with bullying because other students will know if that person is relating to them or not. The students would maybe understanding one another more by knowing that they arent the only ones that are feeling the way they do.

The system also doesnt let people hide their emotions. This could be a good thing and a bad thing. Some people dont like to show their emotions and dont trust people enough to tell them what is going on. This system could be forcing people to say whats on their mind and they might not want anyone to know. On the other hand it might be good for them to get those feelings out and find help or have someone to talk to.

The FACS is still being worked on. It is a great and unique idea that has more positives that negatives. It would be very successful for many schools all over the country. The Faical Action Coding System in my opionion is going to help kids or teenagers more than adults. Overall i think this would be a good idea for schools to have.",3,7,0.7329738140106201
3f0b178,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes the new facial recognision technology called the Facial Action Coding System(FACS). This system claims to read emotion expressions. I think that the FACS could help sience in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship and think it is a valuble thing in classrooms.

Some possitive thing about the new technology are adaptation and improvment. With this new technology we can use it to adapt different things like ads and school lessons. Ads can sometimes completely take out the interest on the viewers for the video and can be sometimes unpridictable. This has happend numerous times in classrooms when a teacher wants to show a documentary that is all ready slighty borring and an ad showing an exciting new superheroes movie comes up So now you have the entire class talking about it and not paying any atention to the documentary about Charles Darwin and what he did. Having these distracting ads adapt to what the audience is feeling could help bring down the amount of times this happens. The FACS could also help in computer lesson planing. If the FACS would be installed in a computer the computer would be able to realise that a student is no longer paying attencion becouse of boredom. So system can then improve what the lesson has by chnging the order around to give the student a more personalised lesson thus having the student learn easier.

There are some bad feedback as well. If the FACS system succeds in improving the academic scores of the students the school administration might deside that the teacher are no longer needed to teach the student, the students could just study in there cmputers. Another way the FACS could not be so good is that it is likely to be very expencive and there is ways a possibility it can malfunction and give unwanted changes in lessons and other sections in which it would be used.

In conclusion I think that the FACS could be of great help in the world if it could be 100% reliable. This system could benifit the every day use if used corectly and I think that the FACS could help sience in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship. I think it is a valuble thing in classrooms. ",3,7,0.8216871023178101
3f19352,"Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.

School brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". It also states ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor"". By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don't implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little.

There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". It also states ""The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"". This evidence illustrates by the aouthor shows how great and advanced this technology is, being able to identify not only one emotion, but more than one at the same time, letting the world know, but most important the teachers in a classroom that they don't have to worry more about to be able to identify by guessing how a student is doing, because this technology has the answers. It is so hard to identify when a person is feeling all types of feelings and not be able to help out becuase no one knows what the mixed feelings are . Teachers have a rough time with students trying to figure it out. But with ths technology teahcers would be more notified of the problem, so they create a scenari to help them out.

Emotions are everywhere, everyone experience at least one of them. This new technology not only helps the person to express an emotion but to produce them. A teacher in a classroom is able to teach but sometimes they are not able to transmit the feeling of learing to the students, and the new technology Facial Action Coding System would be a lot of help. In the passage it states ""The Mona Lisa is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". It also states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, incluiding emotional communication"". By this evidence the author projects how this new technology is capable of doing just anything and how it helos to improve the best on a classroom, helping out not only the students but the teachers. With this new technology teachers would be able to get the students to be more interested in the class, leading them to get a good grade, and to the understanding of every new topic.

Now, Do you think this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?. By being able to detect 6 basic emotions and even mixed emotions, to recognize whether a student is bored or confused and by helping the person not only to express the emotion but to produce it, it is shown that this new technology is valuable. Communication is one of the basic steps to create a better living world but sometimes communication is just not implemented in society. So the help of this new technology is needed. A teacher woulld be able to help a student is they knew if the students where confused or bored. They would try different types of ways to get back the attention of the students so they can do good in the calls. Another reason is being able not only to know one emotion but multiple emotions; Teachers wouldn't have to be guessing the emotions of the studetns, and the time lose trying to guess their emotions, they would be finding ways to help the student solve their problem, becuase they already know what is going on. In the classroooms it is very hard for the sdtudents to concentrate in a very boring topic, and the teachers just will continue beuase the sdtudents just don't communicate or show anything else than just a black emotion and this new technology is able to get the person to express the emotion.

3f198e7,"Could you see a software reading your facial expressions? Do you think this would be something to actually look into and have in the future? Well honestly, letś get into details about the Facial Action Coding System and find out what it would actually do.

First off, I would like to get into paragraph four it had stated and I quote by Dr.Huang ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions"" this is something that can maybe interfer with the program what if the expressions are to hard to read. Also, stated in this paragraph the author is talking about the ¨video imagery¨ to recognition software it would track the facial movements. Would that actually be safe a software to basically record or video the movements of your face and show what is going on in that moment. Would people actually know when this software is up and running and videoing these peoples faces?

Now, letś get in more detail about this program and what happens when your in a classroom and it could show what youré actually feeling. Would you want a computer software to know what your feeling in that moment and it would also show your teacher how you felt about the project or assignment you were doing. This could actually be a huge disaster or it could be helpful to the teacher and students. Some students may feel down but show happiness instead of actually letting someone know their true feelings. This would actually be a huge help to the teacher to help the student feel better and see what is going on with them.

Therefore, would this actually be a good idea and safe or would this just be dangerous? Well thereś an answer to that question and it would not be a good idea.This article does not state when the kids would know when and if this software is actually on. Also, if you really read it toward the end it states ¨Putting on a happy face actually works!¨ ¨A renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.¨ So, some people may or may not be coached and could actually trick the software. Nowhere in this article states that they could garentee 100% acurate results.

So in conclusion, this would not be okay for students some may actually get a few things past this program. This program cannot garentee the 100% accuracy we need to actually let this program go through. As I stated earlier students may have been coached to show a different side and could trick this system. ",4,7,0.7703830003738403

I'll be using details from the article to form an eassay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is valuable. I'll be sure to include, a claim for or against the value of using ths technology to read student' emotional expressions, evidence from the article to support the claim, and an introductions, a body, and a conclusion to my essay. The reasons i'm going to use are why it's valuable, how we can use it to help other, and how to use it correctly.

First of all let me explain the passge, the passage talks about how we can use technology to identify human emotions. How is this technology valuable, well it's very valuable. The FACS (Facial Actions Coding System) which is the technology that identify humans emotions, can let us see how everyone is. We can use the FACS everywhere that will help us to help people. Help everyone, and even animals. Help everyone in there time of need. Help those whom don't want help. Those who can't control themselves. Those that can't think correctly. Those whom are at the blink of death. A lot of people and so many more lives can be save with this technology.

How can we use it to help others? We can use the FACS to identify human emotions and help the ones that are sad. We can help them before somethings happens, like we can prevent a school shooting if we know how the persons feels. We can give them all the help they need. No lives have to be lost if we know how everyone feels. We can even stop people from killing themselves, we can change lives with this technology. We can even help those who don't want help because they are people to that are hurting. We have to help those in need and I know we can do it with the help of the FACS and change the world. It would be a lot safe out there. We can do all of this because of FACS and that's why i think its very valuable.

But there always a correct time to use this. If we can tell if someone is really depress that's when we do something because it's hard to control yourself when you are really sad. We shouldn't just wait and see what happens, we have to do something about it, because we are all human. If we see someone very depress we try to cheel them up, but what if we can't tell. That's also another example when we should use them. We can stop things from happening, bad things.

Futhermore I believe that the use of this technology can be very useful in many ways. In my essay i have show you why it's valuable, how we can use it to help other, and how to use it correctly. I also include a claim for or against the value of using ths technology to read student' emotional expressions, evidence from the article to support the claim, and an introductions, a body, and a conclusion to my essay. This technology called the FACS (Facial Actions Coding System) which is the technology that identify humans emotions, can help many people in there life, make it easliy for us to help those people, can help save people lives from hurting themselves or others, and make us prevent school shooting, people killing themselves, and save people life in many ways.

How can they accurant about they're emotions though? I personally think that only a person can feel what they're going through. I don't think technology is so accurate to look into someone's soul.

Prof. Thomas Huang and his crew discovered a new software that can recognize emotions. However I believe that no one can tell other people how they but them theirselves. How can they actually calculate emotions, only us humans express what we feel, not technology. This software begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This software is not very accurate.

We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking at their face because you know the person that well.

This tehcnology could be of value for students. The Facial Action Coding System can be beneficially useful to read the emtions of students in a classroom to provide insight on how students feel about specific classes and how they react to challenging subjects, and to change the way classes are taught.

According to the author, in paragraph four, the Facial Action Coding System can identify various emotions. The software can even identify mixed emotions when people have an expressionless or neutral face. The FACS software has the proper anatomical information for the human body. It can easily identify what a person is feeling even if they have several emotions present at once. In paragraph six Dr. Huang states that a classroom computer with the FACS software could recognize what a student is feeling, whether they are bored or confused. If a computer can identifythe emotions of students in a classroom, then this can be used to make modifications to the lesson or maybe the whole class. For example, if a student is struggling in a certain subject and the computer were to identify the whole classroom as confused or bored then the teacher would have to make improvements to the lesson. This would benefit the students who are feeling lost or bored.

If the FACS software could identify the emotions of the student, then this can be used to find improvements for certain classes that students struggle in. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang says that most human communication can be nonverbal. If a student was in a difficult class and was to embarrassed to ask for help, the FACS software has the capacity to identify the precise muscle moevment for the expression of cofusion in that student. Paragraphs seven and eight of the passage describe the small muscle movements made to convey a true smile. The author then goes on to say that these muscles can be spotted to prove whether or not someone is displaying a sincere emotion. Paragraph nine also explains that making a certain facial expression can cause you to feel that certain emotion. The FACS software is advanced enough where it could idnetify if a student is truly confused or not and it can help find new ways to teach by determining the sincere emotion of every student.

The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" introduces the Facial Action Coding System, FACS, that helps identify human emtions. This software can be beneficial in many wyas, such as in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System can be used to read the emtions of students in a classroom to provide information on how students feel about certain classes and topics and challenges, and to provide on how classes can be taught differently.

If you smile when a AD appears on your screen the computer will bring up another AD that is similar to the AD your looking at right now. But if you frown the next AD won't be the same.

Also according to the article, "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the difference units, the software can identify mixed emotions ( as in da Vinci's masterpiece)."" The article also states "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.

40b5365,"New technologies are always interesting and beneficial towards any aspect of life. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) measures your facial muscles to calculate your emotions. Because there are characteristic movements of muscles when expressing different emotions, the FACS can recogonize the muscle movement and record the emotion. This newly discovered technology has great potential to be useful in several areas, such as understanding facial expressions, animating facial emotions, and commercial use. However, the use of FACS technology is not valuable in the classroom.

First, the FACS's ability to read emotions is not useful in the classroom. It can tell when students are bored, or when students are unhappy with the teaching method, but it cannot change the students' emotions immediately. The best it can do is notify the instructor to change their lesson, as stated in the passage. This itself is not a huge benefit, and is not valuable enough to justify the use of the FACS technology in every classroom.

Secondly, the FACS is very recent, advanced, and expensive. As stated in the passage, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (D'Alto, 7). If a home PC cannot run the FACS program because of its complexity, how would an impoverished school be able to provide this technology to every classroom? The cost of this technology to be placed in every classroom is a waste of money and time. Instead of being used in classrooms, this technology could play an important role in the study of art, such as Mona Lisa, or the creation of expressive virtual faces to be put in use for video surgery or virtual reality. The very limited benefits the FACS brings in the classroom does not outweigh the cost and effort of providing it.

In short, the FACS is a newly designed program that has potential to be applied in many different fields of study, but is not practical for the classroom. The ability to read students' emotions is both unimportant and eerily disturbing. The FACS has many benefits, such as recognizing emotions in art and creating virtual expressive faces, but none of these can be applied to the classroom. ",4,7,0.8349575996398926
411a4c6,"in my opinion using technology to detect if someone is happy is way to overrated for the subtle classroom. most teacers can tell if someone i shappy or little bit sad or completely sad it doesnt need facial coding to describe how someone is feeling at the oment in the time. Some people coud use it to detect it in other studies as in this case on a painting. but to detect someone emotions you dont need technology to describe what normal humans can detect in a person just by looking at them. i could help in a classroom but not on other students or in real life people. if they were examing emotions like foor a therapy class it could work. they could look at a picture and try to desribe what they think that person is emotions are and what that person is feeling. and then use the facial coding to describe it and ifigure it out and grade the students on how close they scored to the emotions and if they scoreed the right ones and percentages. facial coding could help in classroom but only in certain cases where describing someoens emotions come into play and help them describe what that person is felling.

In conclusion facial coding could work in a classroom as long as the class is learning facial expressions and how to detect people emotions. in other cases no it shouldnt be in a classroom that isnt design for those special classes.",2,7,0.8054553866386414
4183f2e,"Many people have tried to predict what are other people feelings with a look on their face, but usually we are not always correct or can't even describe what are feeling. Well their is a software that can tell what people feelings are with just a look on their face, which is called Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This software can read different kinds faces in imagines and real people like students in classrooms. I think it is worth the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions.

The famous painting of Mona Lisa shows no kind of actual emotional expression, but the software can pick up different kinds of emotions. "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, ( paragraph 1)."" All of that, we could not describe without the machine and knowing that the machine works, they can use it on students. In classrooms, teachers don't usually know when students are confused, bored, or having other emotions, they can use those softwares in classrooms. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ( paragraph 6)."" That way teachers know what do when students ethier confused or bored, that new technology will help teachers and students at schools. Usually students don't tell the teacher if he is getting confused or bored, and I think that it is a great way to use the value of that technology to students in classrooms.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would help with teachers and students in classrooms to work more together. I do think that this new technology is worth to read students' emotional expressions.     ",3,7,0.9426851272583008
41b9987,"Facial Action Coding System is a new software that has given computers the ability to identify the emotion of a person. It does this by constructing a 3-D model of the face. This new innovative software can identify six emotions of a human. These emotions are happiness, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. This tecnology can be useful in many different ways in today's world. There are also some things that may not be so good about this either.

This software has many positve things about it that can help students and teachers across the world. The software can help inside the classrooms. Using this software to calculate and identify people's emotions, it would be very easy to see if a student is struggling. Many students who struggle keep it to themselves hoping to catch on. This may not be the case in every student, though. Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If this software can actually detect this, then it would make learning and teaching way easier. Teachers could try different teaching methods to help with the growth and progress of their students and help them understand what they're doing. They could aslo try something that is more fun and appesaling to the students. This technology could be lifesaving in the classroom.

Although this software could help many people everywhere, how does everyone feel about this? If used in the classrooms, some parents and students may not want this to be a part of their learning environment. Many students could be sad all of the time due to person issues and home life. Would they want their teacher to know that they were always upset? I think that it would be a good idea to first have recieved permission from every student and parent before allowing this into the classrooms.

I also think that this software could literally save lives. If it is able to identify these emotions, it could prevent students from harming themselves. The software can determine your emotion based on every little detail of your face. In pararaph 8 the author states, ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" With this being said, if you try to hide your emotions, the computer will still be able to tell. I think school counslors should have this tecnology in schools right now. Getting proper equipment to identify how a student is feeling could help the counselors talk to them about their problems because not all students will share how they feel.

With all the information that i provided, I definitely think that this technology is valuable. The software provides accurate results and it could eaily help students and teachers everyday in the classroom. What more could you ask for than a safe and reliable software that could raise test scores and possibly save some lives? This may just be the next big thing.                ",5,7,0.8908624053001404
41e799c,"Do you think that if you had a Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in your class that you would understand what is going on in that subject? I'll tell you that this is not the case.

First,the invintion of FACS created by Prof.Thomas Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman at the University of Illinois with help from Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam is supose to recognize human emotions and he explains that ""We can accually calculate human emotions like math homework"". There are 44 major muscles in your face and the movement of one or more is called an action unit.Knowing this they can even detect a fake smile or frown ect.

Furthermore,The creators say that if the FACS machine was in a classroom that it could help solve any problems that a student has.The machine could detect if there was a ploblem a student couldnt understand,and that it could change and fix the problem if the student couldn't understand. I dont believe that it could because if one student doesnt understand and it changes the whole problem or subject I believe that it could throw off the other students as well. Also we never know if it could detect the right emotion or if it could malfunction and or distract others.

In conclusion, I don't believe that the FACS machine would be ethical in the classroom because, it could malfunction, detect false emotion,and or be a distraction to others.   ",3,7,0.84317946434021
421ed60,"The claim as an imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even trying tot hide their emotions. Perhaps the new software developed improvements in perceiving emotions of others.

It explains within facial expression for each emotion. By using the software as they use to do tracks and making it 3D realistic, it can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutal face which meaning no show of emotion. As an example, imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen then a smiliar ad might follow but if you frown the next ad will be different. I know that its not true that if you make a confusion face in front of the computer screen it wont appear a confusion. Let's say you make of your own, using the computer to make a 3D of a person face which it could be anybody, you control and how you feel into it, it'll appear what you put in and it will show how you felt about it by loking of your final results on making the portrait.

For humans which they perform the same impressive ""calculation"" of how much emotions come into what you feel. As an example: you have a friend and you look upon their face, you wonder and can tell if their sad or happy. It's way different as they say on software than in person as a human. You can automatically describe how the person feel is by looking and talking to them. It shows a lot and you can define if they are good or not.

By knowing the differences on defining facial expression each on software and as a human, they are two completely different things and how it can be solve too. As being explained how they calculated by using technology and making 3D Mona Lisa, showing emotion to it collecting your actions. By how you make it as weighting the different units. In human which person per person, you can define their feelings and talk about it. There's no way you can hide away your feelings because sometimes you can sense it. It shows more out and can easily say what they feel than as software which is not believable or no comparasion.              ",2,7,0.7585671544075012
423a7ea,"The thought of a computer program being able to read emotions sounds very interesting at first. It almost makes a person feel like he or she are in a science fiction book set in the future. Though it may be interesting, that does not necessarily make it right. The truth of the matter is that though a computer program measuring how someone feels may be interesting, it is an invasion of privacy and teachers have no need to know a student's emotions while in class. The new technology, Facial Action Coding System, is not valuable to be used in a classroom because it is an invasion of a student's privacy and is not necessary.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to be used in a classroom because of how invasive it is to a student's privacy. The text explained that the technology was able to determine that in the Mona Lisa painting the person being painted was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent happy. No one should be able to know to that great of a detail what another person is feeling without that person's premission. If a teacher wanted to know the emotions of his or her students, simply asking them how they feel is enough. Using that technology in a classroom crosses a boundry of privacy that many students would not be comfortable with. Many students would not feel at ease and safe being in the classroom knowing their emotions are being read.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to be used in a classroom because it is not necessary. In the text Dr. Huang, who works with the Facial Action Coding System technology, says that most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Students and people in general are already communicating their emotions to the level that their emotions need to be communicated. When someone sees another person smiling, he or she knows that person is happy, or if someone sees a person frowning, he or she knows that person is sad. The text says the technology could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored to support that the technology could be beneficial in a classroom setting. But the truth of the matter is, if a teacher wants to know when his or her class is becoming confused or bored, all he or she would have to do is ask. That is why most teachers ask after a lesson, ""Does anyone have any questions?""

Not only that, but a teacher would not have to know if a student is happy or sad in the first place. The responsibility of a teacher is to teach and to ensure the students understand. A teacher does not need to know if his or her students are happy or sad. A school would be wasting its money to pay for a system that is not of necessity.

It is evident with all of the facts stacked against it, that Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in a classroom setting because of its invasiveness to student privacy and the lack of a need for it in a classroom. From the fact that knowing exactly everything students are feeling would make students uncomfortable, to the fact that a teacher could ask a student if he or she wanted to know how that student is feeling, it is clear this technology lacks value in a classroom setting. School administration and the community should ensure that this kind of technology never gets put in any classrooms. This would be a waste of money for the school corporation because of the lack of necessity for it. It would also make many students uncomfortable, which could in turn make it harder to learn.",5,7,0.9083098769187927
4258514,"Can you see the emotions in the Mona Lisa? A latest technology that can recognize emotions was the latest innovation from Prof. This technology claims it has the ability to read every emotion, even in pictures. Is this a reliable technology or is this something that isnt exact?

The recent technology on seeing emotions talks about how the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How can we know if this is true because we were not there to tell what her emotions where. Yes you can see some emotion in her painting, because it states that Da Vinci studied the human anatomy so that it would help him with painting facial muslces precisely to show emotion.

This technology can be good for some purposes. Dr. Huang makes a statement saying, ""A classroom computer could tell when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human structor."" This is a good factor, because this can help students with school so theyre not falling behind.

Overall this technology may have some pros, and it has some cons. If you put it to good use like for instince helping kids when theyre confused or bored it will show them other ways which is good. Then you have your cons. This technology might not always be precise and at some point this could lead to problems when trying to solve a serious situation.

425d8c4,"With the rise of technology and accesability, students in schools are bound to wonder away from the current lession and tred towards their phones in the face of bordom or general stress. How can we fix this you may ask, with emotion detecting technology. This technology can help schools in that it focuses on specific muscle groups, can detect false emotions, and can help students get beck to the task at hand, school.

First off, how does this technology even recognise emotion? Emotions are always displayed by body poster, facail exspressions, and speech. This technology primarilly focuses on facil exspressions. By focusing on 44 major muscles and a 3D model created within the software through a camera, can effectively distinguish 6 basic emotions. These emotions are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the must move like human muscles....six basic human emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" This technology works so well in fact that it was able to calculate the emotions on a painting. The one and only, Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. In this instance of the painting, the software concluded that she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This being said, you can see all of these features in the painting with her smile; however, her smile is also seems to be hiding other small emotions that can be portraied as insecure but wholesome. If this technology can effectivly 'see' the portrable emotions off a painting, then it can most definatly can be used within the school systems.

What about the common conseption that students go to school with a smile but arn't really happy? It can do this too. It comes to that facail movements can be seen as true or false by the muscles that are being used in that moment in time. Such as the muscle group, zygomatic major, used in a genuine smile; however, in a false smile you also use the risorius. ""But in false smiles...using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" The usefulness of this technology doesn't stop at just being able to identify false smiles but teachers can use this information to more effectively connect with the students. When a student is a distracted by stressers, they can't focus, and when they can't focus, it makes the teachers look like they arn't doing their jobs properly by the test score of the students because of it. This stratigy however, is nothing new. In the eyes of an exspert, facail exspression tell your true intentions. ""To an experts, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celbrity isn't being truthful."" Thus, this late technology doesn't seem to far fetched to use in our schools.

As I breafly mentioned in the last pharagragh, students need to be able to focus in order to be seccesesful in school. With modern stressers that teachers sometimes don't see as big deal, students on the other hand may lead to distraction. With these stressers far and wide, how do we identify them? By using the facail recognition software. Say for instance a student as his or her mind elsewhere besides the classroom and is missing out on a major transition lession that is the key to the next few lession. They won't get it and will further lead into new problems. But say that the software picks up on the student and detects that he or she is feeling angered, depressed, or just has a lack of intrest. This software can then send the data to the teachers computer thus letting them know that they may need a recap or support in general. Thus further action can be taked by the teacher to strengthen the bond of students and teachers. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Another way that it can be used in the classroom as if the students is angered and frustration is building inside because their minds are in two places at once to only confuse them even more. The software can be designed to shut off the computer, alowing the student to take a breath and contemplate on what is wrong themselves before an intructer aid them in the personal mater before continueing on into the lesson as a whole. ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above yours eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" In short, the possibilities are atronomical when thinking of incorperating them into a schools systems.

In short, the addition to facail recognitions systems into the schools is a great idea. Thus it can recogize emotions effectively, detect false emotions, and help students regain focus within the classrooms.

Although, the Facial Action Coding System in unique it is disruptive to a class. The article says that this new system could help kids with their learning by ""recognizing when a student becomes confused or bored."" The computer would then have to alert the teacher and disrupt the class while learning and everyone then would be confused. There would also be computers all around the class and kids would most likely pay more attention to those instead of their lesson.

All of this new technology seems cool but can people trust it? This computer ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" and from that it base a persons emotions by facial expressions. That is not something people could really trust. A person could easily smile and really be sad but the computer thinks the person is happy because they smiled. The computer also only know happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness but what about other emotions like depression?

As a result, misunderstandings come in and miscommunication happens and life gets that much more complicated. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" by Nick D'Alto, it talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This particular system is able to use computers to identify human emotions based on their facial expressions. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could show when a student is not understanding based on their expressions, it could help the teacher to know when and/or if a student has the lesson down-packed, and the technology is set up based on expert's opinions and reasrch.

The Facial Action Coding System is something worth investing in because the world is becoming more and more advanced and with this system, computers could possibly know whether a student doesn't understand what is being taught. In the article, the author explains how the system works. The text says, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions... Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This example shows how with the software, it will be able to pick up on when a student is expressing signs of distress because they don't understand. The author also uses the example of Web ads. He says, ""...If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" This proves how the technology will be used to observe and then change to the person's preference. This would be a big help in the classroom because students have different styles of learning and the computer can help to identify which one a student prefers.

If the system continues to grow, it could somehow enable the teacher to know when a student is ready to move on to another lesson because they already know what is being taught. In parapgraph six, the text explains how the programming can be modified. An expert says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This particular example from the text shows how the technology is so advanced that it help the teacher by doing his/her job. The software could somehow notify the teacher when a student is ready to move on or when one needs to work on the lesson a little longer.

The technonlogy is set up based on expert's research and opinions, so as there are more studies done, the system would be able to tell more accurately what a student is feeling and the lesson could be adjusted based on that. In paragraph five, the author supports his claim by saying that Dr. Huang's ""new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" Dr. Huang's research shows that the software will be continously changing and with those changes, comes advances that will be better equipped to help a child in their classroom. The author uses Dr. Huang's opinions to further his claim. Dr. Huang states, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements."" The explaining of the software proves that it will help children in classrooms because it was built upon years of studying and experiments. And those tests were used to build a software that could possibly change the world.

Facial expressions can sometimes make one amused or angry or they could even make a person fall in love. The problem is, it is hard for a person to read another person's face- unless they're an expert. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author argues how a technology called the Facial Action Coding System will help computers correctly idenity human emotions based on their facial expressions. The use of that software would be very valuable in a classroom because it could be aware of when a student does not comprehend what is going on, it could help the teacher to know when students are really getting the concept of what's being taught and because the technology is being constantly modified based on research and opinion, it would be reliable.

The computer is not going to help them change their emotion.

Also, the computer is going to be able to recognize their emotions, but its not going to make them feel different.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable, because it is just going to detect how they feel. It is not going to really change anything. The system is not going to provide them with anything to make their emotions change. I feel like they should not have that, because they know how they are feeling and other people are going to know to. ",3,7,0.9006834030151367
43af0ee,"Not being able to exactly calculate what an individual is feeling is not always simple. Imagine being able to immediately detect another person's emotion. The Facial Coding System has the ability to do that. This is a recently invented software that can identify one's emotions by tracking facial movements. There are many great aspects to this new invention. The use of the Facial Coding System in classrooms to read the emotional expressions of students in our classrooms, should be put into action.

This software will make learning less stressful, and more efficient for the student. According to the article, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". By putting this software into play, one can avoid being ""confused or bored"". It will postively influence the student's education since it will have the ability to ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" Not only the student will benefit, but also the teacher since it can be time-saving for them. In the article it also stated that, ""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconciously imitate another persons facial expression."" This demonstrates how we ""unconsciously"" can come to the conclusion of what someone's emotional state is. Most teacher's do not know why their student is acting or responding the way they are. By the use of this invention teachers and students can avoid many debates and students could gain emotional aid. Learning will be successful.

We need this in our classrooms. We have heard and experienced lots of negatuve aspects from computers but this is why experts are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, like the Facial Action Coding system. Who would not want to see students more engaged in learning?",3,7,0.8572324514389038
43c6f9b,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a wonderful idea in my opinion.

The computor for the students can be a interesting dissision for video imagery. The author explain""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa""(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 4). It proves that the video imagery can be a interesting thing because the software can tract facial movement if it's real or not.

Anothor thing about the computor for the students can read the student's emotions. The author states"" The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computor can do""(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 6). It shows that the facial expressions can be read by a computor because the computor can know when you are feeling happy,sad,mad,etc.

The last thing about the computor for the students is that they can be a reowned drama coach. The artical saids"" Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 9).Therefore it explains that the computor can be a reowned drama coach because the computor is carfully produce of the emotions on stage.

In conclusion the computors reading emotions are a best idea in time and only time will tell if we can create artifitial intellegence to the computor for the best in the world.",2,7,0.8307443261146545
43cb52e,"In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile by ""Nick D'Alto"" the author gives differnt claims from different scientst on how a computer can detect emotion by our facial muscles. Computers can detect emotion because it can no the difference from fake and real feelings, for example in the article "" Its all about those muscilar action units. They even indicate the differnce between a genuine smile and a forced one."" Another reason how computers can detect emotion is because just how a friend can look at you and can see rather your sad, happy, mad ect. a computer can program those emotion into styem. another example "" The new emotion-recognition sotfware tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"". Than in paragraph three ""Dr.Paul Eckam"" has classitied six basic emotions and he use those emotions "" associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" . Fianally, in pargraph four Dr.huang said "" Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". (meaning that just because someone isnt smilling as broadly doesnt mean they arent has happy or excited as they appear)

And thats where video imagery can recognize facial movements in a real face or in a painted of ""Mona Lisa"". Computers can detect emotions because its about the muscles in your face that can determine rather you are being geuin or not.",2,7,0.8697474002838135
440ec2c,"Well first off Dr. Paul Eckman created a sytem called FACS, which creates affects and changes on human facial expressions for better results. This allows a new form of technology to change emotions and more. This software can identify emotions just like that!.

In my opinion I think that there is no need for this system to identify facials expressions on students. Because first we are young so you know when we are angry, happy, or sad because we tend to show it. Like body language older people and even people my age know when there is something wrong with one another, because you can tell how they usally are from how they are at that moment. Don't get me wrong i like what Dr. Paul came up with this type of science and technology, but i dont think it's neccessary to change pictures and add emotions to something.

I just think using this technology on these students wouldn't do much, but tell you whether or not there sad, angry, happy, confused, excited, and etc. However this technology shounldn't go to waste I mean you can use this technology in other ways like animlas, you can't really tell whether an animal is happy, sad,and etc.

But so far I like the whole idea just not the type of experiment Dr. Paul is trying to accomplish. His technology that he has created is outstanding , and im pretty shore he can find something else to use it for. So like I said you don't need a comeputer to read a humans face or body langauge.                     ",2,7,0.8925740122795105
441ba57,"""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising applications for a variety of inustries.""(Nick D'Alto). The use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable because it can use facial recognition for ads, it can use facial recognition when working with computers in a classroom, and it can make computer graphics more realistic and expressive.

The Facial Action Coding System can use facial recognition for ads. It can use facial recognition by being in the computer camera, and everytime an ad pops up it can tell if you smile or frown, by smiling or frowning the computer will know whether to have similar or different ads, when showing ads. As stated in paragraph 6 ""[...]if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""

The Facial Action Coding System can use facial recognition for working with computers in a classroom. It can be used when working with computers in a classroom because if it can read students faces then it would be able to know if the student is confused or bored. If it is able to know if the student is confused or bored then it can change the lesson ever so slightly so that it is more interesting and appealing to the student learning. As it says in paragraph 6 ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored [...] then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

The Facial Action Coding System can be used for computer graphics and facial expressions. This technology can improve computer graphics by being able to read the faces of real people and adding their facial expressions into games which would make the game more realistic. Another amazing idea for the use of this technology is the way it can use video surgery to help doctors and surgeons perform facial operations. It would scan the face of the patient and read its face, this could potentially help the surgeons know where his face is most injured and would also help the surgeons have a better look at the patients face during the operation. As said in paragraph 6 ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery.""

The Facial Action Coding System can use facial recognition for ads, it can use facial recognition when working with computers in a classroom, and it can make computer graphics more realistic and expressive. These ideas are just the start of the new technology. The new technology is a gateway to many other technologies that will be built similar to the way this one was. As life goes on so does our technology and as humans create more and more technology, the smarter us humans get. I believe that this technology is just as valuable as the next and even more valuable than the last.

4442f3c,"Have you ever wondered what students are emotionally expressing? Well now a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System are trying to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. Do you think the use of this technology is valuable? A new piece of technology is coming out called the Facial Coding System it enables computers to identify human emotions.

A piece of technology that enables computers to identify human emotions is called the Facial Action Coding System. I think the technology is valuble because so that the teachers and students now what each other is feeling. To backup my claim it says in the text "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.""

Which means that the technology is valuble so that you don't have to describe it will tell you.

I think that the techology called the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable because it could help with communication so they know if you are sad, happy, etc. In the text it states that "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Which means that most communication is non talking just by emotion.

Finally, my last reason I think that the new technology called Facial Action Coding System is valuable is because it helps produce your facial muscles. In the text it states "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". Which means that the technology helps produce your facial muscles.

All in all the technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in many ways. By the facial muscles, the nonverbal communication, and how the students are feeling. There are also many ways to back it up. The Facial Action Coding System is reading the emotional expressions of students.",3,7,0.8823553323745728
44567d5,"Facial expressions have been our way of communicating without talking. Its a silent way of showing how you feel about something or someone. Knowing what expressions are being shown towards an action you do is important. If you yell at someone, they might make an angry or upset face. After seeing that expression, most people will most likely never repeat that action again. In class rooms its hard sometimes as a teacher to teach and notice if everyone is catching along or if the subject is too boring. Having this new technology used to read students expressions is a valuable tool because it lets teachers know if they should continue or stop and help students out.

Many of us have been in the situation were your in class and it is boring. The class feels like 3 hours long and the teacher is into their subject and just does not stop talking. They do not switch things up and not many kids are paying any attention at all. With the help of this technology, which reads students facial expression, it can let teachers know its time to switch things up or move on.

The next class might be much easier to get through and maybe towards the end, be your favorite. Teachers and professors will see what students like best and what they find interesting and develope new and better strategies; or computors will just as Dr. Huang predicts in the 6th paragraph, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human intructor.

Many students also struggle in school. "" A classroom computor could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Students tend to try and be independent or just don't want to ask for help in fear of being made fun of. In some cases many students are confused but refuse to ask for help. With the detector, teachers could ask students if they need help or what they are not understand in class. All helping to prevent students from getting lost or struggling in any subject. Teachers could be doing a better job by understanding the students, and the students too,would feel better knowing that someone knows what they need help in and is coming up with a better teaching plan.

Technology is advancing more and more each day. In no time, we will improve schools and work areas. The way we communicate will better and the way we read expressions will too. As said in paragraph 8 ""to an expert, faces don't lie: these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isnt being truthful""; the same could be applied to students. Facial expressions are important. With these computors or devices put in every class room, students will soon be performing at their top best.

4490ec6,"While technolgy is being developed as time goes by, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", is when technology wasn't good and for that, no one couldn't tell what she's feeling before FACS (facial action coding system) revealed her hidden feelings. Having a technology that can read expressions is valuable and should be allowed. There aren't many affects to it and it would help many people to express or show at least a sign or a feeling.

before feelings were being revealed and shown by a machine, people we're already talented and smart enough to tell one another faces. In the article, the author told us that it's not hard to tell when someone is either sad or happy, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" this quote provides us information that looking at someone's face can give us a lot of hints, even if they try to aviod it or show it. which means it is natural for somone to know notice it while some can't. Another thing that the author tells us is that the muscles are visible and that there's nothing to hid when parts of our faces gives the viewer an opourtunity to either guess or say what they see, "" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" this quote perfectly explains that there are many majors and units where it deals with the muscles and movement in our bodiues. It's easy to tell with or without parts of the face showing.

Lastly, the machine. As technology increases, a machine called Facial Action Coding System, solved it better than using our proper eyes. Dr. Paul Eckman, who combined his thoughts to create the machine, and Dr. Huang, who helped Dr. Paul Eckman build the machine, helped themselves and others to know the hidden feelings of Mona Lisa and sooner will be used on others. In the article, it talks about how Da vinci made Mona Lisa look different while he was drawing/painting her, "" Yet Dr. Huang observes that the artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" this quote means that Da Vinci was smart enough to switch up on the painting and made it seem so realistic and looked like she's going through a lot.

While the readers recieve a lot of information about the technology and how it works, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", was more of a for than against. There's nothing wrong using it while its helping scientist know what's going on inside a person's mind.

The computer software FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can classify 6 basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The passage states that the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit. The passage also states that using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnintion software tracks these facial movments-in a real face or in the painted face of Monia Lisa. It can even identify mixed emotions. Each exspression is compared against a neutral face. The computer can tell weather you are happy or sad. Like in the passage it says that for an example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it can modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.

The evidence from this passage shows that the use of this technology to read the emotional exspressions of students in a classroom is very helpful. like stated in the claim and passage ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""",2,7,0.899462103843689
44bc4d1,"Humans communicate in numerous ways. A popular form of communication humans use is emotional communication. The facial expressions humans convey can show their reactions and emotions clearly. New technology has now changed the way we can communicate with computers. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the Facial Action Coding System technology is valuable because it can help boost morale, track likes and dislikes to modify lessons, and adapt to different learning styles.

A big advantage of the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is the boost in morale it will create. According to the article, the ""Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (D'Alto). The article lists the indicators the computer searches for when the user is smiling, and if the reader follows these steps, they could be found smiling. In a simple action such as watching television, one may find themselves accidentally mimicking the facial expressions of the actors. Scenarios such as this and the facial recognition can boost the happiness of the user and those around them spectacting. Because of the boost in mood and technology, students will be excited about learning and that can make all the difference.

One of the handy uses for the Facial Action Coding System is determining the user's likes and dislikes. This technology can be used during a lesson or activity and can ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto). By determining the emotions of the user, the computer can alter the lesson to make it most effective and get the most out of the lesson. Using this feedback is essential in today's society to keep students entertained.

Lastly, an effective reason for using the Facial Action Coding System is to appeal to various students' communication style. Not all students are outgoing and vocal when it comes to expressing their education and struggles. In the article, Dr. Huang says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (D'Alto). Student users will now be able to have a personal experience when learning online. Because the computer can recognize likes and dislikes, stated in the previously, the student will not feel left out or behind. The computer will match the learning style that is as unique as their communication style. Students will not have to go out of their way or feel embarassed to tell the teacher their concerns, the computer will fix them, making an improvement in today's classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System mentioned in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto is valuable is classrooms because it can help boost morale, track likes and dislikes to modify lessons, and adapt to different learning styles. Having this technology accessible to students is beneficial to their education. Emotions are something everyone has in common and from new breakthroughs, humans can use them to improve. Modernizing education is as simple as a smile. ",4,7,0.8859924077987671
44ce55e,"Should we or should we not we should use computers to help identify emotions is up for debate, but in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he explains some new tech and why we should use computers to help us see emotions more clearly. D'Alto explains reasonons why they are useful in ways such as ads that can tell if you like them or not, education and telling of kids are confused or bored, and some other possible things this new technology could help with. However, I believe that even with all of our technology and advancements in many fields of it, we should not use it to help find emotions for us.

Human emotions are a very complex thing, and with that complexity it makes computers not very useful, even with their algorithims and equations. In paragraph 3 D'Alto explains how the process works ""The process begins... must move like human muscles...Eckman has classified six basic emotions...your frontalis pars lateralis... raises your eyebrows when you're surprised."" This is a pretty interesting way of seeing emotions and a very complicated one. However D'Alto writes ""your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" What he doesnt adress is other people face shaps, such as if you have naturaly small lips it doesnt mean that your angry, or that simply raising you eyebrow in a photograph means you're surprised, maybe the person is just striking a pose and nothing more. With all the people in the world, and all of them being different its hard to tell if the comupter will be able to read all of their emotions accuratly or at all.

Next, D'Alto explains to us that we use this calculation (reading people emotions) every day in paragraph 5. He says ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" In this statement he says that humans themselfs have a hard time decribing emotions on the face and what they mean sometimes. If you really think about this if we cannot describe emotions and we're the ones doing them, why should we believe a computer thats coded, by us, will be able to? Its not an easy thing to do, and even with psychologist such as Dr. Paul Eckman its a seemingly impossible task to get a non emotion giving machine the ability to read emotions, accurately.

In the article ""Making Mona Lise Smile"" Author Nick D'Alto writes about new tech and why is should be used. He provides some evidence and reasonings for things that this new technology could possibly improve or do for us. However D'Alto does not show the counter arguement in his article, and doesnt give any information on how this new tech could fail, or not work very well. Its hard to tell where computers and technology will go in the future, but with this I can say that its a almost impossible job to give a computer, not able to feel emotion, the ability to read them accuratly. Its an interesting idea to give computers and machines to ability to read emotions and possibly other advancements. But only time will tell if this new technology will be able to read our emotions. This technology could possibly put us on a path to understanding more about ourselfs, or it might fail and a new technology will start to be developed and worked on in its place.

452c84b,"Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms. It may sound far fetched, but actually, FACS may be the best thing to come to schools because of its flexible learning and the ability to read the students.

In the education world, teachers are the backbone of the infestructure. Without teachers, the whole system would collapse. However, it may be hard for one teacher to connect with every student individually and make sure they are learning properly or if they are paying attention. This is where FACS comes in. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Dr. Huang talks about FACS in classrooms more in depth, ""'A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human istructor.'"" With FACS, every child could essentially have a customized lesson plan exactly for their needs. This would make children more eager to learn because they begin to enjoy it. Besides the classroom, FACS could also be used in the school elsewhere. One of the other important areas this could be used is in counceling.

It is very hard for anyone to tell someone they are sad. This is especally true when they barely know the person they are talking to. This can be the case for school councelors and the children they are meeting with. FACS may be able to help. With FACS, the school could see if children are upset or scared. The school could also see how often these children feel this way. When a child is unhappy or scared, it is very unlikely that they are going to be doing their work at full capacity. If FACS could find these children that need help, they could be helped faster. This could also be used to find children being bullied. If the child is feeling scared around another student, or if a child is afraid of a classroom, they could be helped because FACS was able to read them. FACS may even be able to detect if a child is afraid of leaving school. With FACS, it's like every child in school has someone that is looking out for them, even if no one else is. It may be true that some children might not want people to know about this, that they may want to hide it. However, it is never healthy to hide such strong emotions, especally if there are people around you willing to help.

With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving.",5,7,0.8334580659866333
45373dc,"With the new use of technology, the ability to read someones emotion by the simpliest look is within our grasp. The ability to read your emotion is easy as said done. Why not put something like this that can read out faces inside school. Traspass their privacy. Even so, during school it would not come in handy with any student anytime during the day. Being watched by a face recongnition in the home of many, is an event many would not agree with.

During the school year, for example, a high school. Where would a Facial Action Coding System fit into? This would not benifit our education other than waste it. The new technology being used on students to detect their emotions is a privacy violation. Students would not want their face being read and pictured by a new face detection. For example, in the story it says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" With this being said, this technology invades our space. Some students don't want their emotions being let out; they might want it to keep that private information to themselves, unless they realease it by themselves. This could happen to anyone, even without them realizing it. For example, sitting in the right position across from the Facial Action Coding System, the victims emotion may be violated without their concent. In the story it reads, ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad might follow. But if ou frown, the next ad will be different."" This text shows a program reading your face in real time for all the time you are on your own laptop. Having your own computer reading your face every second while being in your own home would not be welcomed to many. It's a violation to privacy to use and our freedom.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would not be of use for students. Our minds and face are focused in a different direction rather than facing this machine to read out emotions. Whether this new technology is useful or not, it would not be of good use for a classroom full of faces.",3,7,0.8303698301315308
4575e69,"Prof. Thomas Huang, Prof. Nicu Sebe and Dr. Paul Eckman have been able tro design, read and determine emotions using a computer software called Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Using this technology, they were able to make a computer generated 3-D model of the face in this world famous painting. Using the muscles that lay underneath the skin in this 3-D model, the software is able to determine the emotion of the person based off of the physical characteristics and movement of the muscles.

In using the FACS software ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored' predicted Dr. Huang"" (paragraph 6). Much like a classroom instructor, the computer and software will be able to modify the lesson and instruction to further engage and explain to the student.

However, in a classroom, it seems that teachers will rarely change lesson plans to engage their students, and will further explain only if a specific question is asked, regardless of the look of confusion of the students' faces.

Futhermore, teachers and program writers would have to code for and write many forms of the lesson to explain or engage the students before uploading it to the computer for lessons. If a student is bored or confused, the software and computer system will have to be able to 1) recognze the facial expression and 2) choose from several lesson plans to fit and better the facial expression of the student/user.

As a student, I do not find myself to be facially expressive on the computer, in fact the only expresson I have is within my mind, while my face remains blank. This would make it impossibke for the FACS to identify bordom or confusion. There is also the possiblilty of the software confusing one of these facial expressions with that of concentration when reading or writing.

The article states that "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" (Paragraph 7) If the same algorithms (FACS) would be used to determine the facial feature of Mona Lisa and her expression to aid the computer in determining the facial characteristics and emotions of a student. At our 1-on-1 technology based school, students can either rent laptops or provide their own for school work. If our personal computers cannot store the algorithms of FACS to determine the facial features of students then it would be entirely useless. The school would have to purchase entirely new computers for every student in the school, with the RAM and capacity to read emotions and contain the FACS. These computers would have to be laptops so they can be transported between classes, school and home. This would be too costly for the school or students and improbable in being able to find and provide the correct kiond of computer.

If the FACS needs to be able to computer generate a 3-D model of the face, the computer would run signifigantly slower because it is trying to read your emotions and run any other programs you have open for your class work. Unlike the Mona LIsa, our faces are already three-dimensional, however the computer software would have to be able to generate a computer model of the students face and expression by examining the muscles underneath in the model, which in all liklihood would take much longer to complete than it does for an expression to change or the comprehension of a subject ot take place.

To conclude, although the Facial Action Coding System would hypothetically work to decide emotions, it would be entirely too costly, time consuming, and unlikey in te effectivness of being able to read the expressions of students during class.",5,7,0.8435298204421997
4586b43,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks about a new software that has been developed called the Facial Action Coding System. This new technology is able to identify facial expressions. The use of this technology is valuable in classrooms and can read the emotional expressions of students.

The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to detect human emotions. It does this by associating six basic emotions with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. The six basic emotions classified are happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness. The software claims that Mona Lisa is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 persent angry."" This technology could be very valuable in classrooms because with this new software, classroom computers can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. The author gives an example of Web ad pop-ups. ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This application would be effective in teaching students and could help them retain information. By modifying a lesson based on each student, kids will be able to learn at their own pace; they will not get bored as quickly and space out during lessons. Students do not always say how they feel, so with technology that can detect expression, instructors will be able to communicate with the student and help them with their specific needs. Every student learns differently; in different ways and different speeds. With the Facial Action Coding System, students will not be rushed or slowed down to learn.

Most of human communication, including emotional communication, is nonverbal and is actually shown through body language and facial expression. This new technology will be of great value in classrooms because it will be able to modify each lesson for each student according to their learning styles. This new software can detect how someone is feeling and can help to effectively instruct students.",3,7,0.8838830590248108
4653b67,"The facial action coding system in a classrom is valuable. It is valuable because when a student is confused and doesn't understand what the teacher is teaching, the teacher or the computer will know immeadeality and they or it will help the student understand to further their education process. If a student is bored the teacher or the computer will regonize it and do something to make their learning expirence more remeberable, so when it is ime to take a test they wil remember it and they wouldn't fail.

For example, In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang states that ""A classroom computer could regonize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored,( Dr. Huang predicts) then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" .

This example explains that the computers could help kids when they are confused or bored. This shows that facial action coding systems can be used in school to help kids with the learning and further their education for the future as well the present.         ",2,7,0.815826416015625

Say there is a girl who is having a really good day, she got asked to Prom and she said yes. It made her day and she was happy for the rest of the day. And then take a boy who was late for the bus and had to walk to school. He would be tired and upset. They both have two different emotions, so the results would be different.

Read this part of the article, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". If a classroom did a scan and all the students were tired, not interested, and ready to go home, the teacher could take those results and make the class more interesring for the students. The students would probably have more fun and want to do the work if the teacher made it fun and interesting for the students. But don't make it too difficult for the students cause they could shut down again.

By doing the Facial Action Coding, the result could be different for some students. But it would be fun and interesting to switch things up a bit and have while learning. By doing the Facial Action Coding, you can see how the students really feel. And it cpuld help them and you (the teacher) get a better understanding of how to teach.",2,7,0.7724087834358215
467a47d,"Technology has come a long way from one hundred years ago. As it adavces more and more things can be used to help benefit in any of situations such as in classroom settings. The article by Nick D' Alto ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D' Alto tells how the Facial Action Coding System can help in any situation as it can even read students' emotional expressions in a classroom.

The article informs people the technology uses the major 44 muscles in the face. When the face moves it can detect which muscles are put into use and identify them with one the six basic expressions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These basic expressions off diversity more than just the basic happy and sad, and also account for most emotions. To make sure this is even more effective the given expression is put againts a neurtral face for a comparison. By giving a neutral face and an expression it gives a independent and depent variable. This would ensure a correct basis rather than just giving the face with an expression. It would also be able to tell if a student were enjoying a lesson or not. It help the teacher too see what topics they could make more interesting.

Some people might ask how can it detect emotions accureslty if somone fakes an emotion, but facial muscles do not lie. For example the frontalis pars lateralis muscle indicated suprise though a raised brow. A raised brow would indicate to the teacher that a student had mostly likely just learned something new. If several students had this expression the teacher could decide to keep incoorperating it in the lesson. The zygomatic major is the main indicator of a fake or real smile. For a real smile the mouth is lifted at the corners whereas in a fake smile the mouth stretches sideways. This would show if a topic was enjoyed by a students or disliked. It could also tell which topics students prefered more than other.

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", an article by Nick D' Alto, tells how the new technology, Facial Action Coding System, can read expressions of a student. Once technology advances even more it would be able to help out in an array of settings, and even be able to detect more accurate, specific emotions.                  ",3,7,0.91654372215271

It says that we humans use the same caluculations everyday when we can tell the emotions and feelings of our peers. This technology would be like a emotion calculator for pictures and paintings.

In this essay I gave details on what the 3D tecnology does , it showes a picture emotions when want not to be seen.

46a61ed,"The Facial Action Coding System, created by Dr. Huang and his colleague, was put into place to recognize human emotions. This technology has lots of positives and very few negatives. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is a reliable piece of technology that can be very valuable in a classroom setting.

This new technology can read the emotions/expressions of students while they are doing work on the computers. It can tell whether a student is enjoying what they are doing are if the absolutley despise the work. Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This is showing how benificial this new technogly is to not only a student but also a teaacher. If a student is struggling or just doesn't want to do the work that is presented to them then the computer can ""modify the lesson"" to fit the needs of the students. This also takes stress off the teachers shoulders, now they don't have to walk around the class to answer every single question.

One might say that this new technology can limit student-teacher interactions, which is not benficiary to the students at all. One might also say that this type technology will lead students to become more dependant on technology then the Teacher. These can be proven true but a majority of our communication is nonverbal. Dr. Huang states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."" This is basically saying that since most of our communication is nonverbal we might as well add computers into the mix. which is very smart.

One can conclude that the Facial Action Coding System can be very valuable to classrooms, because they can modify lessons if students show some type of negative emotion towards it. It also takes the stress of teachers and limits the questions being asked.",4,7,0.8773552179336548

That's my two reasons why I support the technology to read students' emostional expressions.

One it carries code to help it detect certan emotions in the human face. Also the code can be kept for years, and would only need to to updated so we won't need to have multiple people tring to tell others how their facial expressions tells hows they are feeling.

Two according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emostions, but also may even help produce them. A esample of this would be the classic of ""put a smile on your face"".

46fa387,"The Facial Action Coding System is a really cool technology. New Software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. I can see how much our world is developed and became more creative. I against the use technoloy to read the emotional expression of students because I think It is unnecessary. first reason why I disagree is we can read someone emotion through their action and the look on their face. Instead of using technology why not talk each other face to face and express our feeling. I also have a strong feeling that we can't exactly know someone emotions and what's in their mind through computer.

First of all, We can read someone emotion through just by action and the look on their faces. we show emotion in everything we do. we don't need teachnology or computer to tell if someone is happy or sad. Our facial show it all. for example, when someone been having a good day or something good is coming up, we can see bightness and excitement on the face and we can tell that person is happy. As Dr. Paul Eckman associated emotions with the characteristics movements of the facial muscles, when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raise your eyebrows when you are suprised. In that case It is really unnecessary to use technology to tell emotions.

Secondly, Instead of using classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored I think it will be more effective if the student and teacher talk each other face to face It's the teacher job to know if their students understand what they are teaching. Of course can tell if the students confused or boed just by looking at them and the look on their faces. Even the computer know what's the students confusing or their emotion, It can't do anythng about it. The computer can't teach them or help them, It's the teacher that can help the students. It's the people, the human that can help when someone emotional. It's a waste of time and money to use technology to recognize students emotion at school.

Therefore, It is unnecessary to use technology at school to read the emotional expressions of students because we can't really read what's exactly in someone mind , the looks of a person the computer recognize might be happy and the person can be deep sad inside. even the computer is smart and can tell if a person is happy or sad. That's might not be one-hunred percent accurate because we are human and it is just a pieces of materials. human are mysterious. human and human understand each other more than the computer understand the emotional expressions of human.",3,7,0.916872501373291

People can now know the true meanings of things. They can detect how someone is feeling. I think this is really cool and something that is unique and has never been thought of before.

The reason why I think it is valuable is because everyone can now know the true meanings of things. In the article, Dr. Huang states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" I think it is quite amazing that you can now tell how someone is truly feeling. Everyone has their days and you can just tell by their face what is wrong with them but that is the obvious. With this new technlogy, you can go more in depth on how they are feeling by simple facial expressions that you sometimes don't notice. In pictures or pantings you see a person half smilling, but that doesn't mean that they are half happy half sad. It just simply means that you shouldn't always just go off by what you see. With this technology you can see what the true meaning of the person's smile is or what their intentions are. In the article, it states that ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face."" If you have seen the painting, you will notice that the portrait doesn not seem like Mona Lisa is happy nor is it trying to bring us happiness. That just shows how much this technology can do. It is just pretty interesting how a computer can know what you are feeling.

In conclusion, I do think the technology called the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

4720230,"Over many years, technology has become more and more advanced. Some of this technology has become so far that it can now detect human facial expression and determine what emotion they are expressing. This technology is called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology, and it enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology can have a positive impact in school classrooms today. FACS can help improve the way students learn in schools, they way teachers teach their students, and most simportantly, help teachers detect when a student is feeling confused.

One of the main positive impacts FACS can have in reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is improve the way students learn. FACS can scan the facial expressions of the students in the classroom and determined if the majority of the students are confused by the leasson the teacher is teaching. FACS could then modify the lesson in a way that students can understand it and the teacher can then further clarify the lesson the way FACS shows it. As stated in pargraph six, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrctor"", this shows how FACS can help teachers in the way they teach. This could also explain to teachers how to clarify even more the lesson to students that may be going through hard times.

Another way FACS can have a great impact in schools all around the country is by improving the way teachers teach their classrooms. FACS can detect many expressions on students in a classroom. It can detect whether a student is perplexed by lesson or simply just bored. FACS can detect which students in the classroom are bored by analazing their facial expressions. As stated in pargraph six, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". FACS can then provide the teacher many ways in which they can make the lesson more interesting so that students can comprehand it better and in a more fun way.

The last way in which FACS can greatly improve the teaching environment in schools is by recognizing when a student is depressed or sad. FACS can detect facial expressions on students faces and determine if they may be going through trouble or are depressed. As stated on pargraph six, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". FACS could recognize when a student is not okay so that teachers can the help those students who may need help, wether that is emotional help or help with school work. FACS could even help save lifes by getting help to students who may be contemplaiting suicide.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can be extremely valuable to schools all around the world. This computer system can help teachers improve the way they teach their classrooms by analazing students' emotional expressions towards a certain lesson. It can help teachers by modifying their lessons in sich a way so that students are not bored or confused by it.

I believe if a student is struggling then they will find the most productive way out of how they are struggling, doing anything to gain some sort of happiness when they are down. it is there business and privacy, I never think that should be put into jeproady. It is impossible to detect 100% how someone is feeling, and I don't think that some new technology is going to change that. Nothing can detect how someone is emotionally feeling, facial expressions don't show emotions. Anyone can fake a smile and that thing be thrown off. Nothing can be said with a ""calculation"" I don't believe that a computer can tell how I feel based upon the looks of my smile, We have all taken a picture with someone we may not want to, but we toughed the smile out in that, this will be no different. Although, facial expressions are univeral based upon the emotion, people can manipulate the system and they will. The whole thing seems very orgainzed, like when the articel states that quote ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. That is truly breathtaking, and almost too good to be true.

but I just think students will rebel when they have something can show how they feel, becasue that computer cannot get into the minds of some people, and truly help them, when someone who is visibly there, and physically there can help them out so much more. Some students will love this feature if it ever gets adapted, but most will rebel, and dislike school even more than some of them already do.

Emotional expressions are how someone feels, and thinks about anything, a computer will never be able to tell me how to feel or think, and some corny ad for a youtube video will not change me if something truly drastic is affecting me, I think that the entire production of the FACS is magnificent, and truly admirable.

I just think in this date and age that you cannot influence someone on how they think, or how they feel. If someone is happy, you should continue to let them go with the flow, and do there own thing, not crowd them with a computer that could potentially know how they feel, although I find that very unlikely, I am an optimist and hope that I can find reviews about this thing one day.

The technology creates a 3-D computer model of the human face which includes all 44 of the major face muscles. The software then analyzes the face, taking into account all movements of the muscles. This computer model is then compared to a neutral face that shows no emotion to identofy exactly what that individual is feeling. The Facial Action Coding System offers a great opportunity for students to clearly understand the material they are learning, confidently be able to excel on a standardized test, and receive a better education overall.

The Facial Action Coding System will alllow students to understand the material they are studying much more clearly and completely. The system can evalutate a student's face and be able to show whether that student is happy, bored, or confused. If the student appears to be bored or confused, the computer could then possibly modify the lesson and make the content easier to understand or enjoy. This would have extremely positive effects on classroom productivity. If all students were able to completely understand material, they would not only be well prepared for a standardized test, but they would also be prepared to continue their

path in life towards a university or full-time career.

Many students stress over certain standardized tests. Some students don't understand the material they have learned leading up to the test, while others just don't do well on tests. This software could dramatically increase the overall scores of students' standardized tests. The use of this software could also help to alleviate the stress of some students that are preparing to take these standardized tests. Because certain tests are used to determine whether a student can enter a certain university or take a certain class, the Facial Action Coding System could also allow students to pursue the career that they enjoy. It would allow them to take the classes and go to the universities that apply to their own personal interests. Overall, the system could help students achieve their life goal when they otherwise might be unable to.

Because the Facial Action Coding System would allow students to test into classes they enjoy and possibly enter their dream university, it would directly help that student to get a more fulfilling educatiion. Without the system, some students are unable to take certain classes or attend certain univesities because their grades or test scores may be too low. If they are able to take classes they enjoy at their dream university, then they will be more prepared for the world they encounter when they leave high school or college. Attending a university that they enjoy could allow individuals to receive a degree in a field in which they are passionate and pursue a career that they enjoys that could also benefit them with a steady income and insurance benefits.

Because it allows them to get a better education, clearly understand the material, and be better prepared for certain tests, the Facial Action Coding System presents a great possibility for students to be successful. The system would allow students to clearly understand the material by analyzing their facial patterns and showing whether they are happy, bored, or confused. It would allow students to better prepare for standardized tests because it would help the students to clearly and completely understand what they are learning. This could also allow them a chance at a better education because higher grader and better test scores could allow them into their dream university.

47824ea,"Facial reading technology could be considered as an invasion of privacy. Seeing it in this light, it would essentially reveal emotions to others when one may not want them to be perceived. Although this technology may seem invasive to some, it could benefit classrooms in a variety of different ways because of how perceptive this technology is. The Facial Action Coding System would be a vital improvement to the classroom because it would allow the teacher to know how the lesson went and make improvements upon it, make students happier, and check on a student's well-being.

Many times in a classroom, students are not willing speak up to tell a teacher that he or she is doing something wrong. However, with the new facial techonology, teachers will recognize how their method of teaching is affecting their students. With this new feat of technology, teachers will be able to know how their students are feeling. They could recognize flaws in their lesson plan if students became too bored and disinterested with the topic; they could have the ability and knowledge to make it more engaging the next time they teach it. While many people have the ability to fake an interested or happy expression, this technology would be able to tell even the slightest of differences. They even have the ability to tell ""when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"" (D'Alto 8). Considering these are people who are always in the spotlight, these miniscule differences would be difficult to detect without this technology. In classrooms, even the best of actors would not be able to fool a computer system. Therefore, teachers would be able to make drastic improvements upon their classroom if they wished to do so.

If teachers recognize what they are doing wrong and would be willing to change it, students would be happier overall. If a teacher said something wrong or especially demoralizing to a student, they would be able to identify what it was and apologize or learn from their mistakes. The class would be more engaging and fun for students which would then prompt them to be more attentive in class. They would have more fun and learn more from the teacher. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" watching others emotions can make someone feel the same as the other person. They could create empathy among their students if they smiled more and would be able to create a better and more light hearted or elated atmosphere.

With facial recognition technology, computers may be able to recognize when something is wrong with a student so that others could go get help. Improving a student's well-being is an important factor for many teachers. If something is wrong with his or her home life, a computer may be able to tell and alert someone before a drastic situation occurs. Many problems could be prevented by checking in on a students well-being such as bullying. It would be more effective then students going to tell adults because many are afraid to do so. Depression among teens is at a record high, and this could help prevent students from suffering as much; it would also be able to detect anxiety and teachers could use this in turn to help reassure their students.

The classroom would drastically improve if The Facial Action Coding System was implemented becuase it would be aware of the atmosphere of the classroom and the people within it. By seeing how students react to the class, teachers could help make the learning environment more engaging. Through this creation, students would be happier in the classroom and would essentially learn more if they were more interested. This techonology can benefit many students under emotional duress who might be afraid to speak out otherwise. If schools implemented the Facial Action Coding System, it would improve the lives of the students and the classroom as a whole.    ",4,7,0.8467482328414917

You do not have to just use it for paintings. I believe that schools can benefit from the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom when taking tests and or in a lesson.

The Mona Lisa was tested on using this amazing software and from these findings we can use it in diffrent fields. When the Mona Lisa was tested it was found that she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How cool is that, how we simply use a software to discover things that we may have once not known or were uncertain about. This can change the way everyone look at pictures today and in the near future. We are getting more advanced every single day. If start to use tech such as this software today we can discover more than ever before. Many people can benefit from such advancements like researchers and schools.

Schools all across the world can become far better educators from this. All across the world students take many tests. Many high schoolers and college students in a classroom feel very stressed out from all the work they do. With this software we can help them when they need it. This can be put into a classroom where the computer and can recognize when a student is becoming confused or even bored. This could help many who struggle through lessons and even bring students up to par with others. This technology can modify the lesson like a more effective human instructor. If we can help every indivisual student by reading their emotions then we can help each student acheive.

I believe that if schools can encorperate this software into thier lessons that students will not be as streesed, bored, and confused. Every school should realise the value this can bring to a class.    ",3,7,0.7947586178779602
47da28b,"How can facial scanning computers tell people's true feelings? Sure, computers can read our face and tell us the expression given, but they cannot tell how you are truly feeling unless we tell them ourselves. Facial expressions on people's faces defintely tell us how they look and might feel but not all smiles can be true just by scanning someone, expecially with computers.

Technology can tell a person their expression but not their mood of the day or that current second you have a device scanning you. Technology results always malfunction or crash or never come out correct. However, today people are deciding that technology has improved with that even though it has not. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" it sates in the first paragraph,"" She' 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No that's not your science teacher, grading your latest lab assingment. It;s the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona LIsa- at least according to some new software that can recongnize emotions."" In this quote, it clearly states that it's just some new type of software that thinks it can scan emotions. Yes it says emotions but cannot scan the deeper meaning inside humans. NObody can tell how you're feeling except yoursef. In the article, it also states,"" IN fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.""This quote states that people make suggestions on people's feeling but their observations, not the person telling them. People shoud not be putting all the say in technology or observation because you never now whether you could be wrong or right. Having this device in the world is a 50/50 win-lose situation. Many people do believe that these devices can help people out with telling their emotions but not the true mood. Also stated in the article, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion- recognition software tracks these facials movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" Along with saying that computers can detect fake smiles and real smiles, this is correct which also explains they can never know the true meaning.

Lastley stated in the article, it says"" TH the real simle, the zygomatic major lift the corners if your mouth while in a false smile, the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle."" This shows that technology can only detect the real or fake smile of someone along with a ""true"" expression for someone from observation.

IN conclusion, everyone cannot lie on technology for everything because you never know when the computer is making a fase observation,because people make mistakes everyday along with computers. And if we simply cannot trust them with that, then how can we know we can believe their results about facials and not the true mood.",3,7,0.8179550170898438
483511a,"As class begins, it becomes hopeful that the teacher will give an actual interesting lesson. That all goes to waste, when the lesson becomes boring. In the end, no knowledge is gained from it. The question then comes into place, by the look of the students' faces, does a teacher notice when their students are bored and confused? A new technology has been developed called the Facial Action Coding System. This software can discipher peoples' true emotion according to the look on their face. This process is done by analyzing ""all 44 major muscles"" that can determine emotion. The Facial Action Coding System should be installed in all classrooms because students will gain a better understanding of any lesson and teachers will be able to improve their way of teaching.

Facial Action Coding System can be very useful in the classroom. According to the article, ""a classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored...it could modify the lesson."" When it comes down to a student's education, modifying a lesson is a way for the student to able to understand it better. As if they were confused or bored, they would not be getting any knowledge from it. A software that detects confusion or boredom from a student is key to letting a student have a better understanding of any lesson when modified. Therefore, it would also improve grades and comprehension.

Not only will students benefit from Facial Action Coding System, but as well for the instructor, or teacher. Sometimes, a teacher could get carried away with a lesson. Meaning, that the teacher won't notice the faces of their students letting them know if each of them are understanding. According to the article,""by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" A student doesn't have to be just confused or bored, but it's impossible they might have mixed feelings about a specific lesson. Once a teacher has recieved this information, it becomes more clear to which student understands and which does not. This will provide insight on which student needs more help to get a better understanding. Also not only will it tell how students are feeling during a lesson, but the teacher could reflect on their teaching skills. Students who show boredom, teachers could figure out how to make the lesson more interactive. Due to this, it will improve their methods of teaching too.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms all over the globe because it could benefit both the students and teachers. This software could modify lessons when it detects confusion or boredom in a student. Therefore, the student would get a better comprehension and possibly better grades. As for the teacher, the students' emotions could reflect back on how they are teaching a lesson. As a result, their teaching skills could become improved and create a more interactive and involved classroom. The Facial Action Coding System is a software that could change and affect all education positively. ",4,7,0.8629511594772339
4836f2f,"I think that the use of the Facial Action Coding System is very accurate all the time and it should be forced to read students emotional expression. It reads the muscles in one's face to calculate how they are feeling. Also it would be very benafical for students to learn better.

The Facial Action Coding System looks at the movements of all 44 major muscles in the human face as said in paragraph 3. Dr. Eckman has classified 6 basic emotions: happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He has studies how those emotions contract with human facial muscle movement. Using video imagery the system will monitor the face. Making it universial to anyone that uses it. The software can identify mixed emotions. For example the Mono-Lisa 93% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. It is similiar to the calculations we perform everyday such as telling how someone is feeling by the look on his/her facial expression.

This would be tremendously beneficial for students because it can adapt a lesson particularly for that exact student. Making the class lesson more intersenting and benefical for the student to remember and retain what they just learned in the lesson. Also within the system it can detect a fake smile due to a different muscles being used. It could also be very benefical on students in medical school. It would benefical for them because it can make animated faces more expressive in video surgery. Humans mostly have communication that is nonverbal including emotion communicatio, and this would be a great way for doctors to study it.

The use of Facial Action Coding System could do tremendous things in human psychological research. It can help adapt a amazing classroom lesson made custom to the student only. Also it can truely detect peoples emotions by reading the muscle movement in the human facial anatomy. This could help cure depression, and anexity related issues. I think that the Facial Action Coding System could work, and I believe it should be reasearched on more.   ",3,7,0.868855893611908

It has been made to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

First, it constructs a 3-D model of the face and the muscels in the software must move like human muscles. It makes an exact replica of your face and your face muscles. It shows you your emotion by using the location of your face muscles. For example in paragraph 3 it states,"" Your frontalis par leteralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised.""

Second, It can tell you if you have mixed emotions. It can calculate exact emotions while we can partialy do this. In paragraph 5 it states that "" You can probally tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" The computer can show you this.

Third, The computer can help you by knowing what your emotion is. It can see when your happy looking at something so it can show you more stuff like that. It can see when your sad so it wont show you more stuff like that. It can see when your confused at something and so it can explain it to you differently so you wont be confused.

In conclusion, The computer constructs and exact replica of your face and your face muscles. It can tell you your exact emotion or mixed emotions. It can help you feel happy by showing you what you want to see and not showing you what you dont want to see. It can help teach you things that you differenly by showing it to you differently if it sees that you are confused.

This is the third time this week going over chemical equations and the fact that you still don´t understand it, is embarassing. So you don´t ask for help. What if the teacher knew based soley on your facial expressions? Using the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom would be valuable to students who are unconfident in asking questions and to students who really care about their education.

Well known, some students struggle with verbal communication. They are shy, socially underdeveloped, or just uncomfortable with holding a conversation. If there was a device like the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in classrooms, it would help teachers know who understands and who doesn´t. Who still needs help and who doesn´t. This could be the difference between passing or failing.

Students go through a lot with life-changing tests, and pressures to be successful in life. With the FACS, teachers will be able to sense when a student is unwilling or not trying; teachers will know to not waste valuable time on them. These types of attitudes are contagious especially in a classroom. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, we unconciously imitate eachother´s facial expressions and moods. This means other students won´t want to learn either.

4910896,"I believe that the new technology which is called the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea that will help value students in a classroom . The Facial Action Coding System can help determine the way you feeling , reliezes that you might need help on a lesson that you are not comprehending very well , also it knows when something is bothering you .

When on a computer the Facial Action Coding System determines the way you feeling when the computer constructed 3-D face model revolves around all fourty four major muscles in a human face . When you show emotion towards the computer and have a movement of one or more muscles it is called a action unit which helps the com puter bring all your emotions together and be able to seperte them into they percentages . For example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ( above your eyes) raises your eyebrows which means your surprised . Your orbicularis oris ( around your mouth) tightens your lips that shows your angry . There many muscles in a human face that has a variety of different ways to show their emotions .

The new technology can also relieze when something is bothering you . For example when your friend ask "" whats wrong ? "" and you say nothing your friend dictated that you were lying so his/her mouth would stretch sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle , the risorius hich means dont lie . Also it can tell when you are putting on a fake smile and actually hurting inside . The computer is actually showing empathy by feeling someone elses emotional state . Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them .

492fb37,"After reading ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it is a smart decision to say that it is valuable to use the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. I support this claim for a few reasons. The reasons I support using this enhanced technology in a classroom environment is because it could help students become less confused about the concept they are learning, it could be used in a school counselor's office to help students identify their emotions and what they're feeling, and lastly, it can keep students focused and ready to learn in the classroom.

It would be valuable to use the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom for students because this technology could possibly help students become less confused about the concept they are learning. Throughout the world, many students are in pretty challenging classes, and most of the time, they are smart. Some of the things in these classes however, are not always easy. Many students struggle with the concepts they learn and are often confused. With this new face reading and emotion detecting technology, the scanner will be able to detect the students facial structure and what they show will predict these emotions. Imagine a student learning something and he/she gets confused. This happens all the time, and most students show a face that shows they do not understand what's going on. This face may look something like a furrowed brow or a side smirk with the mouth. Whatever it may be, the student is confused, and needs help. The Facial Action Coding System will be able to detect this, and the teacher will see the results, then will be able to clear up the student's confusion over the concept. Problem solved! This especially would help with students that are not as outgoing as others and are reserved in class and are not comfortable to ask for help in front of the whole class.

Another reason that the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable for students in a classroom is because in places like a counselor's office, it would help the student to identify their own emotions. A lot of students, especially after something has happened in their life that has impacted them in a negative way, need to talk to someone. Their emotions need to be expressed, and this new technology would help students identify these emotions. Picture a student walking into a counselor's office that is having a rough day. The student sits down and explains that he/she is having trouble identifying what they are feeling, or they don't know how to feel about what has happened. The counselor would talk to the student, then for extra assistance, use the Facial Action Coding System. The system would then give the emotions for how the student is feeling, so now the student will know, and maybe feel better. If not, at least the emotions are now recognized/identified.

Lastly, this Facial Recognition will be able to tell if a student in class is bored. It can also tell how many of the other students are bored. This can tell the teacher that maybe how they are teaching the material is not the most beneficial way to the students. In many cases, the students are bored with what they are learning, so they may put their head down or even have a bland look on their face. When students are bored, they tend to give up and not pay attention at all, and they are not motivated to learn anything. Therefore, they do not comprehend the material like they need to. This can help teachers know that they need to change up their lesson plan to keep the students occupied and attentive with the material, so they understand it better. This will then have the potential to raise grades and be more successful with the classes they are taking.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be a valuable source to use with students in a classroom for these reasons I have previously mentioned. This new technology would be very beneficial in an environment at a school. It has proved the emotions of the Mona Lisa painting, which many people are confused about, so it clearly has a lot of potential! This will allow students to learn in the most beneficial way possible, and will cause them to be more successful in the classroom, and in the future.",4,7,0.8997003436088562
4972301,"Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because many student will come into the classroom with sad face and nobody will know what is wrong with them but with the Facial Action Coding System, everybody will know what is wrong with a person if he/she is sad in class, And is not everybody that feel happy everyday but with this kind of technology we will be able to know what is wrong with them and we will make sure they feel happy.

In paragraph 5 the author say that in fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""caculation"" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. But some people can tell how a person feel but only the person friend and that is not good but with the Facial Action Coding System evrybody will be able to tell how a person feel not only the person friend.

In paragraph 6 it say that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and that will make the teacher find something that will u feel happy and keep u busy. But without the Facial Action Coding System the teacher will not be able to know what is wrong with a student is either they are confused or bored she won't be able to tell becuase she can't know how the student feel but with the computer the teacher can see if the students are happy or not and they are not happy she will be able to find a way to make them happy.

If they ad these to classrooms to tell how boring or fun they are and how to make them better I think some kids would actually want to go to class. There are three things I think really make this possible,and they are muscle scanning, used for interigation, and making class better.

This first reason is very good. The muscles in faces can really tell the actual expression of an individual or even an entire class. In paragraph 3, line 2, the author says, ""All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This means it uses 44 different muscles in the face to figure out someones emotions. This can be very accurate it seems like, if you have an investigation and you have 44 pieces of evidence, how likely are you going to be right? Very likely.

That brings me to my next example, interigation. imagine you have 8 people who have been caught and there was a murder. If you ask all 8 of them I garantee you will figure out who murdered the person. In paragraph 7, line 12, the text states, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This can tell you if a person is lying or not, along with a couple other factors. Lets say someone is being asked a couple questions, if they asked the person if he broke into a house recently they can tell if his stress levels are high.

Then we can also make class better with this facial scan. If they put this into a classroom more kids would want to go to class because it can make class better. But it can also have some down sides. Some teachers might use it to be more serious and less fun. Then kids wouldn't want to go to school and just stay home. But if the classroom is more fun and less stressful the kids won't learn as much. In paragraph 6 line, the texts says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" this means they can have the computer tell them what they are doing wrong and change it to where the classroom is fun but you also get alot of learning in.

This is why I think it could work. this is a very smart idea for the future and I think that most people would like this idea too. It can really change the future and these are three ways I think its a good idea.",4,7,0.7349035739898682

4a1a43f,"Reading someones facial expression may be effective sometimes but that does not mean that they are actually feeling a certain emotion like anger and confusion for example, but they could be feeling extremely happy. In the article, the author stated that Dr. Huang used a picture of Mona Lisa to test the new emotion-recognition software but the software may not be effective because they tested it on a painted photo and not a real living person. Also, da Vinci could have exagerrated Mona Lisas facial expression for the sake of the painting so they may not be accurate.

Using this software in a classroom may not be effective because if a student is making a certain face that does not mean that they are bored or confused, it could just be how their face naturally looks. The software can also mis read their face and even glitch. The use of this program would require the use of a camera through the computer and that is not always safe. Hackers could be trying to hack their computer and steal personal information from the person or even their identity.

And their face expressions can depend on how their hair looks. If their hair looks all over the place its probably bad and if their hair looks all nice its probably happy.

My conclusion is to find someone feelsing is look ing at their face and their hai and how their face looks. Just like actors be doing reproduce smilling and frowning.

All of their research on human expressions went into this software. They noticed your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you are surprised and your orbicularis oris tightens when you show anger. By using the software on the Mona Lisa painting, they predicted how she was feeling. She was more happy than angry according to the software, but by looking at the painting, a human can not tell if she is happy, angry,or sad. The computer can tell us how she is feeling by acknowledging her muscles in her face. This software can also tell us when a student is happy, confused or bored, and it will help the teacher adjust the lesson for the student. ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confued or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". The technology can help a teacher and a student succeed together by telling each other how they are feeling even if they do not talk during class. Most students raise their hands to answers questions, but a student will not raise their hand to say ""I'm bored"". Some students do not want to tell the teacher they are confused either. Hence for the computer will automatically tell the teacher and they can explain the lesson better to the whole class because there are always multiple students who need extra help, but will not ask. There for, their software will make humans interact more by telling us how they are feeling.

In conclusion, the software Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe will help read students' emotional expressions. The software has information on how a humans' muscles move when they are happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprised, confused, etc. By using it on the Mona Lisa, we can see that the software works and it will also help find problems in it. Dr. Huang predicts that the software will also help the teacher know when a student is confused or bored. The teacher can then adjust their lesson to make the student more attentive.

My first reason as to why I believe that this latest technology should be used to read students facial expressions in a classroom is because it can modify the lesson. For example when a student is in class and is looking at a computer screen and becoming confused or bored the computer will recognize this. When it recognizes this it can than modify the lesson in a way where it can make that frown go upside down. The lesson will than become more interesting and the student will than be willing to do the work because he/she enjoys it.

My second reason on why the Facial Action Coding System should be used in a classroom to detect students facial expressions is because it will help them academicly. For example when a student has to work on something on the computer that is visually interesting he/she will do a better job on actaully putting in some effort. The computer will read the facial expression on the student and continue giving them things on the screen that will keep a smile on there face. This will result in the student scoring well in whatever it was they were working on because it drew there attention in enough for them to continue reading and looking at the screen.

In conclusion using the Facial Action Coding System has its benifits.When using this new technology in a classroom the students will not only be happy but it will help them do well in school as well. You won't ever have to read anything in class that is boring so make sure you take this new computer software into consideration the next time you are working on something on the computer.

4b50f50,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, a new techonology known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) provides computers and devices to identify emotions in humans. The techonlogy does this through scanning facial muscle movements and with basic psychology knowldege. However, this new techonlogy is also being proposed to being used in schools to have more effective schooling based on the emotions of students. The using of FACS to determine the emotinos of students is valuable because it allows for more interactive lessons that are based off of non-verbal communication, which will help students succeed at a higher level.

With the inception of FACS, the interactions between humans and computers can become more efficient, and will allow for more streamlined communication. In the article, Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication"" (6). If in a classroom situation, a computer trying to teach a lesson with students might not be able to understand if its pupils are getting the concepts, or it wouldn't be able to dectect whether the students are paying attention or being engaged. Since most human interactions are non-verbal, the computer would have a hard time communicating with the students to understand what was wrong. With FACS, however, the computer can analyze non-verbal cues and alter its teaching style. This in turn would allow the students to have a better time and have a higher understanding of the materials being learned.

Not only does the concept and development of FACS allow for more streamlined communcation between humans and computers in the classroom, it also removers barriers between humans and computers by allowing computers to act more like humans, creating a more effective learning environment. In the article, D'Alto states that like how FACS learns to interpret emotions based on non-verbal facial cues, ""we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day""(5). This means that by giving computers/teachers the ability to accuratley identify emotins (to some extent), we are lessening the difference between a physical and a digitial teacher by making the computer more ""human"". In an age where the world is becoming more and more digital, it is a neccesity that students and computers are able to communicate effectively. If Dr. Huang's quote ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'""(4), is true, this means that if a computer can analyze mixed human emotions in a classroom setting, it is possible that not only will the computer modify lesson plans to make teaching more interesting, it will also have an almost artificial empathy, allowing for students to be more accepting of a digitial counterpart.

In addition to streamlining communication and being more relatable to students, the usage of FACS system in a classroom computer can also be used to solve conflicts and make resolutions between students. In the article, D'Alto states that some facial muscle movements, showcase negative emotinos and false emotions as well. One of these muslces is the orbicularis oris, which tightens one's lips to show anger(3). Furthermore, certain muslce cues ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(8). Since FACS is able to analyze these kinds of movements as well, it can detect when two students are angry at one another, or when a student is lying or being subtly disrepctful. By being able to recognize these situations, the FACS system can advise teachers on how to solve these various conflicts or negative scenarios and can be of use to better the general nature of the classroom.

Overall, throughout Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is shown that by using the technology known as FACS, communcation between humans and computers can be streamlined. When placed in a school, FACS is valuble because it modify lessons to make teaching more effective, be more relatable and approachable to students, and can resolve conflicts in a classroom. In the future, with more and more systems such as FACS being implemented, it is possible that soon computers will devlop emotions of their own!         ",6,7,0.8581928014755249
4b8a067,"Are you someone who is really good at hiding your feelings or emotions? or are you someone who is expressing everything that you feel inside and emotions?. More importantly, are you someone who likes to express your feelings but is not good at expressing it?. I am someone who is really good at hiding my feelings and someone who is not good at expressing feelings. I smile when I am sad and I cry when I am happy. The technology won't be able read my emotion when I can't even express myself. Therefore, the use of technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable because it cannot read your mind, it cannot see or feel your feelings and it will cost a lot of money.

First of all, I don't expect the computer to read my mind because it's imposible. It may read your outside

such as your appearance, body, or your outside emotions but it can't read what you are thinking inside.The article said, ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". I disagree with the quote above because you never know if she is pretending to be happy, surprised, sad or joyful. When you think about it, the only person that knows how you feel and how you think is you, the technology cannot define it. Let's say you are laughing in your mind and you don't show it outside, will the computer see your emotions?. Therefore, the use of this techology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable or inffective.

Furthermore, this technology cannot see or feel what you are feeling inside. The article said, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". The quote is basically saying this technology can see your emotions but I don't agree with it. Some students could be hiding their emotions or feelings. for example, one student is hurt and deeply sad inside but is pretending to be fine and smiling, will it know what she is feeling inside?. It will only see the fake emotions, the outer appearance and that is why the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable.

In addition, this technology is considered a high technology so it will cost a lot of money to own it. Some schools might not have enough money to purchase it. If this technology could do those things, most of all the schools might want it and if they can't purchase it, it is sad for them. Plus, this technology is not useful so why spend a lot of money on it. There are a lot of ways the schools could use the money such as donating so why spend money on technology that is not useful. It is not worth spending the money for, that is why the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable.

In conlusion, the use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable because it cannot read your mind, it cannot see or feel what you are feeling inside, and because it costs a lot of money. It may see what you show but it cannot see what you actually feels inside unless you express it. If you are someone who is not good at expressing your emotions or feelings, this technology is not for you and is not valuable.    ",5,7,0.7393393516540527

that was created by Dr: paul eckman can classifiy 6 basic emotions like happinese,surprise,fear etc, The mona lisa were described its emotions

by the FACS system wich means we will have this technology in classromm sometime later we can see right now face unlock on some phones just like fingerprints or use the eye to like fingerprint which lead to the same point that we are in 2018 and we already have computers or even computers can act like human""i mean robuts"" they can know how you feel and act just like humans.The FACS technology can even know your emotions even tho it is

neutral face we as human can know how friend feels but we have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys emotions.Like teacher can tell how student feel but She?He do not really know how to describe each facial trait the conveys emotions.

Well we do not really have this technology in

classrooms,but i think starting of 2050 we will start to have this technology in classroom it is just expensive but starting of 2050 I am pretty sure some schools will offer that for students to make some computers be even a teacher for the student like if the student felt bored the computer makes the lesson fun for him/her.We are in the best period of time that

we develope technology so we can make the imbosable bosable we can as humans make things that nobody will expect.",2,7,0.8073002696037292
4ba65c3,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea. It can have it's pros and cons but I think that the pros overdue the cons. Three reasons why I think it's a good idea is because it tells you how someone might be feeling, if they are lying about how they feel or not, and that if they don't want to tell you, you can figure it out.

First of all, do you ever wonder on how might one person might be feeling? I bet you have. using the Facial Action Coding System can help with that. It can be hard because if you really care about someone and you might wonder how they are feeling. You can ask but what if they don't want to talk about it because it makes them uncomfortable.

Second of all, what if you ask a friend on how they are feeling and they say they are fine, but clearly they are't. People can lie about how they are feeling. They might show something but deny they are feeling some type of way.

Lastly, what if they don't want to tell you but you really want to know so you can help. the system can help with that. It would be much easier because now you don't have to ask and make them feel moe of what they are feeling.

In conclusion, I think that the Facial Action Coding system is a really great idea. It would probably take a long time for mostly everyone to have that system. But in the future there will be some type of system like that, that everyone can afford and have.",3,7,0.6517435312271118
4bbcd54,"In this story we are trying to see if the technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

I think that the computer is going to work for that, is not going to be the same but is going to work. The monalisa is something that people believe in but if a new computer software came out with 3-D and 44 major muscles must move like human muscles. I think that computers can read peoples emotions with just a video imagery. In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang said that "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"".

In this case i think that the computers are the prefect thing to work with because the technology is growing really fast. I think that computers should identify if a student is confused or bored. The same technology can make animated faces more expressive. For video games Dr. Huang said that ""Most human communication is non-verbal, including emotional communication"",""computers have to understand that too"".

I learned that computers can make a huge different in our life, and it can help us know how we're feeling at the moment. I think that's a really good thing for a future that is coming.      ",2,7,0.8320268988609314
4bc1460,"I believe that the use of the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable towards students in a classroom. One example is that not all humans could possibly express emotions the same way therefore the student may not express an emotion completely. Someone could keep a straight face and feel many emotions. A direct quote from the passage is ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry,"" which I disagree with because it is unrealistic to know all the emotions a person is possibly feeling and especially how much percent of each emotion. I think it's absurd to trust this technology. The computer may be great and have all this amazing technology but there is no way that it could calculate emotions correctly. Another reason I disagree with the Facial Action Coding System to be valuable in classrooms is because not all classrooms need computers to work the way the class does and is supposed to. A direct quote from the article I disagree with is ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I believe that is where the instructing should be, within the instructor. I however agree that the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to video games. A direct quote to support that detail is ""the same techonlogy can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or videosurgery."" My final reason i disagree with the Facial Action Coding System to be valuable in classrooms is because the example the article uses does not really support their claim in the strongest ways possible. The direct quote that leads me to believe this is ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" The author should have used more persuading evidence to allow others to think this techonlogy would actually be important or valuable in any situation. These are reasons I do not think that having Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable.",3,7,0.845659613609314

Another reason why I think its valuable is because it also said about the FACS , that some guy named Eckman, creator of FACS in the passage said that ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness- and then assiciated each with characteristic movements of the ficial muscles.""

4c06773,"I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because that picture of mona lisa smile it had some hard proof on what it does and what it would do.

In paragraph 4 it gives good details on why it should be used it states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal observes Dr. Huang. "" eventhough individual often show varying degrees of expression""(like not smiling as broadly). Using video imgery, the new emotion-recogition software track these facial movement - in a real face or in the painted face of mona lisa. By weighting the different units , the software can even identify mixed emotion (as in da vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

Now see that up there was really everything that caught my eye. it gave perfect everything. The claim for the value of using technology to read students emotional expressions.

But the real reason why i think that it would be good is because you can see if somebody having a good or bad day. now if its good then good but if its bad then you can know to leave them alone.

And then it also states in paragraph 9 that making a happy face can make you feel slightly happy.:""moving your fanial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help prodce them.

4c1ae2c,"The new techonolgy called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a valuable tool for reading students emotions in classroms or elsewhere for many reasons. Since the system is to detect and go into depth of a persons emotion, accurate results will come out. There are multiple ways that this system can help teachers in determining how a student feels. These things such as knowing if the student is confused about a topic or if they are in a bad mood or not. The Facial Action Coding System would be of value for these reasons.

First off, this techology can classify the six main human emotions. Those which are sadness, happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and being surprised. Scientists have used the Mona Lisa picture as a way to help their research. As you know, Leonardo Da Vinci's painting, Mona Lisa, is a painting that relays many emotion's or face's in the picture. We are not able to tell if she is smiling or not, if she is angry or not, if she is happy or not, and etc... The system was able to detect the emotions of the painting, so if used on students', teachers will know what a student feels when a student puts on an undetectable face.

Furthermore, the use of thistechnology in classrooms will benefit how each student can learn. In the article, it states ""For example if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This will help students who may be having more trouble in certain subjects in classrooms, by adjusting to their learning style. That way the student may be able to understand more about what they are learning in the way they think. Since teachers cannot always detect how students feel about their teaching, the FACS can help and describe their expressions on certain lessons that are being taught.

Another reason as to why this is a valued source of technology for a student is because it can affect the way a classroom atmosphere will be. If everyone is happy, the class will also be happy. It says in the article that ""... moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" If students put on a happy face then that will affect how they feel. Same with having a sad, mad, or surprised face. With this technology, since it is able to detect emotions by the facial structure, students can change their facial structure so that it may affect their actual emotion. This technology can also prove if a student is lying about something. Certain muscles in the face, if they are stretched, can determine if a person is being truthful or not. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"" In classroom's, this technology can be used to help solve problem's occuring in class and be able to figure out the truth. Not only that, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal incuding emotional communication'"" this technology is also a great way for nonverbal communication between students when they are not able to verbally or physically communicate.

Overall, the Facial Action CIoding System is a great value of techonology used to determine a students' emotional expression. It can help adjust to a students learning type, help better atomosphere's, and better a person's emotion. It may also help a student if they are not in a good mood, and may need help from a friend or teacher but not be able to say it, but instead show it. This technology can help a lot for students in many of those ways. ",4,7,0.9124715328216553

There are universal signs of emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprised, and disgust. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements.

Imagine what it can do for schools in the world.

I believe it is a great idesa to have these software emotion-recognition in schools because it can give students a better way to learn. If the computer can see that a student is annoyed by what they are doing it changes the way the activity is going to get the students more interested in what they are learning. The more the student gets interested the more that he/she learns just by actually paying attention. The computer can also help make grading easier as well.

4ce2007,"Facial Action Coding System is a new piece of software that allows people to identify emotions using only a photo, this is revolutionary because it allows scientists to get an idea of what is going on in the photos, kind of like how it would have been like to live in the time period when the photo took place. This essay will be about why technology like that is groundbreaking and why we need more techology like it. In the first paragraph, the reader is introduced to how the Mona Lisa was used as a test in order to discover what emotion she was displaying when the photograph was painted.

The reason that technology like this will be important in helping us in the future, is because of history, while most people would assume that this is unimportant and we don't need to scan photos of historical events and people because we already know all there is to know, but infact it's the exact opposite, because we can now scan faces, we are able to go a deeper into history instead of assuming what happened, we are able to go farther into history than we have ever gone before. An example of this is with war photos such as photos taken during the Civil War, if scientists were to scan the photos of people in the war, we would be able to better understand the person in the photo, such as if they were scared or angry, if the loss of a fellow soldier, maybe a friend, made them afraid, or if it made them angry and want to avenge their fallen friend, This example I just provided is very possible, evidence for this is in paragraph 4 where Dr. Huang states ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" which means that no matter what, emotions show up the same regardless of anything.

This technology could also be used with teachers. Teachers would be able to scan their students to figure out what bores them and what excites them so that they can get the students to pay attention. Getting a student's attention is always very important because if the teacher doesn't have the student's full undivided attention, then the student can't learn the lesson the teacher is trying to teach, and if the student can't pay attention, then he cannot learn, and if the student can't learn what they are being taught, then the student will fail their test which could lead to failing the entire semester.

Facial scanning technology has come a long way, but it still isn't finished, in the later future we should see major improvements to it altogether. In conclusion, facial scanning technology is a tool that in the future, history will use heavily in order to further understand people of the past and how they felt. In the close future, teachers will be able to scan student's faces to reveal how they feel about the subject they are learning, and how it could improve rather than staying the exact same.

It's belived that by using computer codes to help see emotions can help at school. It could also help us with our personal life.

Psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman creator of FACS had six major emotions. '' Movement of one or more muscels is called an ''action unit''. The six major emotions are happy,surprise,anger,disdust,fear,and sadnees. When you are feeling sad, your face muscels change and when the computer see that change they know u are feeling sad.

When you are on the computer and your computer knows that you dont like an ad it will change to something differnt.''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''. This can help the teacher by helping sudents or pick up the pace so students dont get bored or confused. And most comunacation is non-verbal and by emotions.

This tecnology can also help us with our personal life as well as school. We can usually see if one of our friend is happy or sad we do this every day. So why do we need a computer to this for us. Well if we dont know the person we mught say something wrong. And with the help of tecnology we can better understand it. BY making the a little move on how you feel it can change your emotion.

The theory of emotions states that just smiling makes you happy and changes your whole mood.

For a student, a facial action coding system, to be able to tell your emotions is probably something that most students do not want. It would probably make most students uncomfortable for a machine to watch their faces to be able to tell what they're feeling. But in a teachers way of seeing this. It can prove valueable to help him or her out with the student and teach them in a certain way that makes the student feel happier or they figure out whats wrong with the student.

Some evidence for this is. ""A classroom coputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" They could then modify the lesson for the student and provide more focus in a certain area. Say the studnt was confused and the teacher never knew he was confused because he never really showed it to the teacher. Well this system can do that and be able to tell the teacher that he needs help.

In the end Facial Action Coding System is a great way to help out teachers and make their job a little easier to be able to improve their lessons and make the student smarter. But students like my self wouldn't want a machine to watch them, while im doing their work, and tell the teacher what they're feeling. It would make the student want to hide their emotions even more. Plus you wouldn't want the teacher to know what you're feeling because you could get in trouble if its something bad.          ",3,7,0.8733181953430176
4da0062,"Have you ever thought about a computer reading your emotions? me neither, that sounds pretty cool huh. Well today its possible for your emotions to be read by new technology called ""the Facial Action Coding System"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, this allows computers to recognize human emotions. I believe that this new technology can change things and improve the relationship between computers and humans.

Now lets take it back to Leonardo da Vinci and his Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help him paint muscles on the face as precisely as possible to show specific emotions. This painting was the first to be tested on this new software, yes a painting not real physical human face. The result showed hat Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. The whole process of calculating emotions begins with a computer constructed 3-D model of the being identified, the 44 important muscles have to move like human muscles. the movement of one or muscles is called a ""action unit"".

Dr. Eckman has classified the six basic emotions which are; Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Dr. Haung says in this passage that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)"". humans calculate emotions everyday, you can tell when your friend is mad, sad, tired just by looking at their face. but not everyone can some people have trouble reading facial expressions on people.

Think about a computer knowing your exact emotion. For example when your doing an assignment that requires you to do research and the computer can tell that your getting bored with the website that you found by indentifiying your emotions at the moment, it could give you other sites that might interest you.          ",2,7,0.8576200604438782
4dd14fc,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author starts off by saying the percentage of the different effects Mona Lisa has in her smile. He states that she's 83 percent happy , 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The use of the new technology called "" The facial action Coding System'' in my opinion does not tell you how your honestly feelings. There is no way the computer can see the way you are feeling , just by smiling at the screen does not mean that you are happy. People smile at the screen all the time and has different feelings. Weather the computer can determain how you feel the only person how actually knows how you feel is you and yourself only. A computer can not recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel. There is no way the computer will let you know how you feel , the article is basically saying that just be smiling or looking at the computer it can determine how you are feeling. Once getting to paragraph 3 it starts saying how the facial Action Coding System works they start off by telling us how the process begings, "" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face: all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" From that sentance in the article it is basacilly saying how the computer has a 3-D sensor on it, and when placing your head infront of it it will scan your muscles and from there determine the way you are feeling. As humans we perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. It is hard for a person to determine how ypu are feeling with just facial expressions , for example I could have a smile on my face but inside I could be feeling sad or mad and only I would know no one else. So the 3-D sensor they have on the computer to determine the way you are feeling is not true , a computer can never determine the way you are feeling it can never say that you are 5 percent happy and 90 percent sad , it does not work like that. Only you and you only know the way you are feeling and thats it. So no a computer can not determine the way you are feeling it can not determine the percent of nothing only you know how you feel and nothing else knows how you feel. ",2,7,0.8134797811508179

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can make learning more interesting, it's accurate, and to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

Using the Facial Action Coding System in a learning environment could help make education more interesting. To make learning more interesting, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. The same technology can make computer -animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Dr.Huang states,""Most human communicaton is nonverbal,including emotial communication so computers need to understand that,too.""

This means that computers would need to know nonverbal communication.

Along with making learning more interesting, the Facial Action Coding System is really accurate. The FACS begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr.Paul Eckman classified six basic emotions and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Dr.Huang even observes artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles precisely

enough to convey specific emotions.

In addition of the FACS being accurate, it develops new ways for humans and computers to communicate. The FACS developed new ways to communicate in various ways. It tracks facial movements by weighing the different units. The software can identify mixed emotions. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology is valuable because it can make learning more interesting, it's accurate, and it develops better ways for humans and computers to communicate.        ",4,7,0.8846805095672607
4eea7c5,"So imagine being able to detect how someone is feeling, if their feeling sad, mad, happy, excited, or even really furious. Tell me would you like to be told what your facial expression is by just looking into your camera or computer. Well now we got a new software that has been devolped that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The new software is called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" or as I like to call it the computer that decides how your feeling today as in like "" 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. Here's how it works a computer constucts a 3-D model of the face, then all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans muscles. One movment of one or more muscles is called a ""action unit"". It just reconize the movments of the facial muscles.

In my opinion i think it's really stupid or as in some people like to call it non-valuable because the company who is creating these types of softwares instead of making something more resourceful as in like making a software program that in every gun when it's passed by a metal detector it gives an alert, As in like they should put a micro chip in a gun and whenever that gun passes through a metal detecor it alerts on a computer this goes for all the schools. But instead we are making facial expressions on cameras and computer just to tell us how mad, sad, or angry we are. As I can recall it helps us with what? Oh right it helps us fix our tone and atitude.

So as in my opinion I think that the software ""Facial Action Coding System"" is really non-valuable cause instead of helping the community there making useless programs. In all cause if they could make ther facial action coding system work to be able to reconize if your happy, mad or sad I think they could be able to create a way better resourceful program maybe even better a program that could help save lives. But you know that was my opinion and maybe some people really like it, but im just saying what I think a classroom full of students would say.           ",2,7,0.8141583204269409
4f06c54,"Emotions are hard to read. You think you know what someone is feeling by their facial expression. Just take the Mona Lisa for example. What precise emotions is the woman trying to potray? That is why Doctor Thomas Huang invented the new software that can detect emotions. The new software should be used in the classroom to determine the emotional expressions of students.

Dr. Huang said ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" This means that trying to understand what someone's facial expression is saying or how they are feeling is hard to understand. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements."" The software reads every muscle in the face and its position at the time of the expression. It then determines what the person is trying to communicate through their facial expression. This could be helpful in the classroom by seeing if someone is confused, happy, bored, or tiresome.

"" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" This says that the software is capable of keeping the students attentative to the lecture and can help a student understand the subject.

The software is also capable of spotting when someone is lying. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" The software could be used in the classroom in the following ways: to see if a student really understands a subject, can be used as a lie detector, or can be used if a teacher knows what they are teaching. Going back to the facial movements, a student could say they understand something but really they do not. Just listed above, the software will detect if the student is lying about that.

While some would oppose this software, it would be beneficial to be used in the classroom. This would be the same thing as adding computers to schools. Many were against adding computers into schools, but now they are used every day by every student. The government could use this software on interrogation and in the courts; stated above, it could be used as a lie detector. ",4,7,0.8652545809745789

The system reads the movement of your face muscles to determine how you are feeling. The main feature is that it can help in the classrom to keep kids engaged by telling if there bored or confused.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author shows the use of emotion reading technology is valuable in the classroom.

The software can be extremely benificial in a classroom setting helping teachers and student adapt lesson plans to better help the student learn. With the system in your computer it can tell if you are mad or confused and can adapt the lesson to better fill the need of the individuel student. It individualizes each lesson to better fit the need of the student and to help them learn. This not only benifits the student so the lesson better fits them but helps the teacher teach in a way that gives each kid one on one attention ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (6)

With this system in place classrooms can become more individualized and better reach each students needs while catering to the entire class rather than the individual. The System would act as a human to ""preform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday"" like humans do everyday accessing situations. If humans use this it can better expand our knowledge of each other and how each person works. The Facial Acting Coding system not only benifits the students learning but makes the teachers teaching more effective.

The use of emotional reading in the classroom is extremely valuable. The system increases the capability of the teacher and the learning of the student. With it classrooms become individually tailored without taking the time of the teacher on one kid. Every student is different and has different needs and this software can help make it to schools can better meet the needs.

4f53e1c,"I claim this technology because when it scans somebody face it can tell us the percentage of out facial expressions. For an example Mona Lisa demonstrates that is really surprising to bring a simlie to your face while the computer shows you based on much percentage of happiness you have right now. Another example is that the facial technology had a lot of different movements that can track your facial face movements. Because it all about the muscles in your facial face. They even indicate the difference between a genuine simlie and a force one. You can imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad or angry or even fear. For example, if you simlie when a web ad is on your screen a very similar ad will pop up again. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Based on how you act.

Having this new technology would be a better fit with the people because when is feeling down and the other person don't know on how they feel they always use the facial technology to show the percentages of how down they really are. But for some people they don't need that because we can tell others people facial expressions by just looking at them clearly, which it true.

4f769e6,"In the article, it talks about how a computer can caculate everyones emotional expressions. Personally, I believe that it is kind of pointless for a computer to read someones face to tell what type of mood they're in. Easily, another person can look at your face to see what mood you're in.

In paragraph 4, it states that ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" For a computer to try and caculate a person's mood or facial expression is pointless. A regular human being can do the same thing. Having a computer trying to figure out someones mood is just similar as someone else doing it.

Just because it is a device or technology figuring out a person's mood doesn't mean it is correct. Normally you would think since a laptop or device is advanced, that it could easily tell a person's current mood. In which, I dont agree with that at all.

Basically, I do not think the use of this technology is valuable. Over all it is pointless from having a device to use for deciding someones mood. I think a person should experience finding out someone else's mood themselves instead of using a pointless device. Using a device to me is basically cheating, and it could all be better by a regular person figuring out emotions on a person's face.      ",2,7,0.6978909373283386
4fabf67,"We've all struggled with gauging what exactly our friends and family are feeling at certain times. They may even be a mixture of emotions. For example, happy, sad, confused or even angry. What if we had a way to detect all of the emotions they were feeling at one time. Well, now you can. Prof. Nicu Sebe and Dr. Huang have developed the Facial Action Coding System which has proven to be useful in many scenarios. Such as, in the classrom, indicating if a smile is, or is not genuine, and lastly, being able to read every single emotion someone is feeling.

Some people may believe that is doesn't matter what students are feeling in the classroom because it is not the teacher or a computers duty to cater to that student's feelings. But, that is incorrect. Because, according to Dr. Haung computers can be very useful in redirecting the lesson for the benefit of the student. The text states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Haung predicts, 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."" This text is a great example explicitly stating how the Facial Action Coding System can be useful in the classroom. Ultimatly, it is able to help students with their learning just like a human could. All by just reading the student's expression.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System is able to tell if a smile is genuine or not based off of the movement of your muscles. The text states, ""They can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth."" Also, ""Meanwhile, muscles called obricularis ocul pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This evidence gives great detail about how and why the Facial Action Coding System works. By reading the certain muscles that move in your face, it can tell if your smile is genuine or fake. This could be very useful, especially when trying to figure out if a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is actually smiling.

Lastly, this technology can be used to read every emotion that someone is feeling. The text states, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No, that's not your science teacher, grading your latest lab assignment. It's the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa, at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions."" and, ""By weighting in the different units, the software can identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece.)"" The text above is a great example in showing how valuable this technology can be in the world. Being able to read every single emotion displayed in a face is fascinating and very useful.

In conclusion, it is quite obvious how useful this new software could be to the rest of the world. It is flexible, reliable, and fast. For example, it could be greatly used in the classroom to help with student learning, determine if a smile is genuine or fake, and lastly, it can read every last emotion that someone is feeling. This technology is more valuable then we may even realize.       ",4,7,0.9003386497497559
4faf2cc,"The computer software which has been invented is to test the emotion of people. But it is not really a good way to test people like that. If you want to understand the people's thinking when they have a emotion, why don't you learn ecycology?

The program tested Mona Lisa's smile and the result said ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted..."" If I'm an artist, I painted a character which is really beautiful, but I just make that character's emotion really happy, and wants to shows the audience it's a beautiful girls with a joyful face. When the computer software test the emotions of my character and shows these results, I will be really disappointed at these results --- It's way more too acurately! It can ruined one artist or someone else's life.

The computer learned things way more faster than us, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" From FACS, the program will detected the six basic motions: happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Well, that's not going to be accurate, from the example, ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised"", this surprise emotion is just an opinion of the creator Dr. Paul Eckman. I can be tired and showing that emotion too. When the computer is testing the students in the class, there are so many emotions in the class, but even they express their emotion, it's still not fair enough to prove what thoughts do they have. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", at this point, the computer is testing everyone's emotion. But remember, study is not fun, normally that you will get bored. If someone have a happy face in the classroom, that means he is ""crazy"" or distracted by other stuff. So it's useless to testing the student's emotions in the class.

Indeed, the ecycology is better than the program. We can looks through other peoples emotion by our eyes and communicate with them, you will still understand their emotion, because we have our brain to calculate. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" mentioned ""we humans perform ths same impressive 'calculation' everyday"", and than give an example to inform the human calculation more precisly. Even though it's a concession, it still shows it's not necessary to use this kind of tecnology to predict people's emotions.

In addtion, the computer which created by man is still from the human knowledgement, or human ""data base"", which is brain. But it can be limited the testing area, like the emotion that predict wrong. Altough it can test through the muscle changing, It still cannot prove the true feeling of the human. The reason why we have ecycology this courses because people's brain is way more better than the computer. Computer is fast, but it based on human knowledge, also use there is no way to creat a perfect program --- everyone has different opinion to the creator of the program. So it's not really valuable to use this kind of tecnology to read student's emotional expressions.",3,7,0.7886483073234558

First, the article does specifically state ""Your home PC cannot handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Most schools do not have anything stronger than a home PC because they cannot afford it. Next, Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This prediction could come true, assuming that all classrooms are devoid of any teachers.

The article also states many other jobs this program could do without replacing humans in workplaces. For instance, FACS could be used by news organizations to tell if politicians are lying or not. Another example stated in the article is using this software to select ads on the web that you will like. And finally, in paragraph 9, it says according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, that smiling may not only express emotions, but create them. The author asks ,""Did making a happy face in this experiment also make you feel slightly happier?"" On the other hand, wouldn't seeing another human make the expression cause the emotion to be a little bit more powerful, rather than having a robot tell you to?

In conclusion, because the computers needed to run the facial software are not cost effective, there are other jobs it can do without replacing teachers, and it is better to smile because you see something that makes you smile, I believe a computer software capable of reading human emotion through facial expressions has no place in a classroom.",4,7,0.8860235214233398

New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valuable, or it could be a waste of time, depending on how you look at it.

Technology has been upgraded throughout recent decades, and most recently, technology has taken a different approach. The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, but is this really a better way to communicate? It comes down to the facts. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Everyone has different ways of expressing emotions, and not everyone feels the same emotions. Thinking that a computer could possibly detect your emotions is a bit silly, to some, and valuable to others. So what makes it silly to some? You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face, you can talk with them in person. Having physical contact is very important when it comes to emotions, using a computer to detect, sounds a bit far-fetched. Schools have teachers, and school counselors, so that students can talk express how they feel. Some people don't see why this feature could possibly be useful in a classroom.

There are many issues going on in the world, much worse than trying to figure our expressions. So, why aren't we using this tchnology, and these smart people to work on something more important? Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, what would you need it for? Human communication is very important, using a computer to detect how you feel is simply a waste of time, in some opinions. Making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotion. On the other hand, what could the Facial Action Coding System be useful for in classrooms? Students may be able to use this feature in physiciatry studies. Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling. However, a computer cannot feel, cannot have sympathy, and cannot understand many things about humans. Reaching the final conclusion is up to you. Is a computer being able to identify your emotions useful in classrooms, or not? ",3,7,0.8483648300170898

50d3e20,"Some people are better at hiding emotions than others, but with a recent innovation from Thomas Huang, a professer at the Bechman Institute for Advanced Science, hiding emotions may no longer be so easy. With the software that was recently created, computers can read emotions off of somebody's face. This information is discussed in Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" which talks about many of the aspects of what the Facial Action Coding System can do. Though there can be some cons with this software, they are out-weighed by all of the pros, especially ones found in classrooms. In classrooms if a computer can sense confusion, boredom, or even anger then a teacher can help the student with whatever barriers they are facing.

Classrooms contain various emotions, including anywhere from sadness to rage. According to D'Alto, ""...the software can even identify mixed emotions..."" That can be very valuable for classrooms so the software can read whether the student may be upset and confused, or bored and uninterested. Once the teacher gets ahold of that information then they will be able to help the student and tend to them by their needs. If a student is confused then the teacher will be more likely to be sympathetic and helpful, while if a student is bored then the teacher might give them more challenging work. Although some people may think that the Facial Action Coding System is a phony, it is proven to be otherwise. In fact, it is very well developed and the article states, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" Not only has this software been tested many times, it has been constructed so it can read facial muscles and destinguish the emotions well.

Along with the fact that the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers figure out how students are feeling about certain lessons, it also gives teachers more one on one time with students who need the help. D'Alto says that the software, ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" When the software does that, it can make a lesson harder for the people who need it or easier for others. Since the lesson can modify itself to the needs of students, that gives the teacher to go around and give help to those in need. Not only can a student get help from their computer, but they can get help from their teacher if needed to. That allows for a student to get two times the amount of help that they could get without the Facial Action Coding System. Some people may disagree with this and think that a computer does not have all of the resources that students need to understand a lesson. Though some people may think that face-to-face learning is more effective, it does not always work that way. In the article Dr. Huang says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication... So computers needd to understand that, too."" Every student is different and learns differently. Many times communication is nonverbal and is just by facial expressions. If a computer can understand that as well a teacher does, there is no problem with computers helping out students.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System can help students is because if the students know others are confused as well, then they can help each other out. Dr. Huang says that, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" If students start to understand how others are feeling about certain concepts then they might not feel as alone. Some students tend to think that it is only them that do not understand a certain subject or unit, but if computers track and show that even though some people might not look worried and they are, students might feel more united. If they are united then that can help each other out and maybe even build friendships. People may disagree with that and say that not all facial expressions are the same, but, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression,"" they are still universal. While one student might be stressing himself out and have wide eyes, a student next to him might just have his eyebrows furrowed. If the computers identify the differences in actions but similarities in emotions, that can really help students.

The Facial Action Coding System is a huge leap in the computer world, and also the education system. If schools took this software into consideration and allowed students to use it, it woud be very beneficial for everyone around them. Kids would get work that suited their abilities and they could get one on one time with the teacher if needed. If the teacher was busy, if the students were able to identify others' emotions from around them, maybe they would not feel so scared to go up to a classmate and ask for help. The Facial Coding System holds many beneficial factors that could help grow the education system and help individual students grow.",6,7,0.9006208777427673
50d9fe2,"When comparing the Mona Lisa smile to othersyou can tell the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one, also Dr. Paul say's there's technology telling what a person if feeling by their face, lastly you can tell when a person is feeling some type of way by a video.

The difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile is that, a genuine smile is when you have to use less bones to smile about e6 bones to smile, and you look like your into the smile for a reason, and forced smile is when there's a smile barley on your face and its easy for you to get it off your face. Because, you were barley smiling, and that means your forcing yourself to smile.

Technology telling you how a person feel is kind unlikly to happen in this century right now. The only way too know how someone feel is by the way they act toward other people and theirself. they isolate theirself from everyone, and they don't be theirself.

When people start looking and things they dont normally look at, or normally watch then you know that something is wrong with them. Because, they not being theirself, and it's not normal for them to do something like that. It would be weird for you, and then your going to want to say something instead of sitting back and watching it happen.       ",1,7,0.5990209579467773
50deda0,"Yes, I think this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can capture any emotion you make and I think that it really helpful to those who cannot read people expression. So I agree with it.

First it can capture your emotion. What I mean by that is when you make an expression on the software, it can capture your emotion and can describe what emotion you are feeling. By some if you feeling sad or happy it can just show you what you feeling so it can be helpful to some.

Secound it can help those who has a hard time reading expression. To some people it really hard for them to read a person expression. Not because they don't know how but because the other people don't show emotion or they just can't read a person expression. So if they have the human facial Action on them it can help them to read the other emotion more.

Third if you the kind of people who have a hard time showing emotion, then this is just for you. The reason is because it can help you to expression your self more. In the paragraph it said that it can captures more then six emotion so if you want to know how to expression different kind of emotion but just can't then you can use the Human facial and pratice until you get better at it and just maybe you make became better at it and then you won't need to use the Human facial anymore.

So overall, I agree with it because one, it can show you your emotion. Two, it can help you read people expression better and can you improve. And three, you can have fun with it.",3,7,0.8228938579559326
50e0abb,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author, Nick D'Alto, shows us that this technology that allows it to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. By using example of the human face muscles and Mona Lisa as an example, allows us to get into debt about our facial expression and what they give out to other people.

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a classroom is valuable because it will be able to read the muscles in the face that are being used in the expression we are doing. "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major musces in the model must move like human musces.""

By creating a 3-D model of the face it allows it to have an exact replication of the face and muscles being used; therefore it will be able to show how people are really feeling. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, and, disgust, fear and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" By classifying every emotion with the musces allows the technology to get an an acurrate feeling of the person.

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a studemt in a classroom is valuable because in the passage it gives examples of the exact muscle and emotion that correlate with each other. "" For eample, your fronttalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your arbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomtic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of you mouth. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different musle, the risorius."" By using the muscles in the face, this allows us to see an exact repredention of the emotions the person is feeling and will help kids in the classrooms.

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a studemt in a classroom is valuable because it will allow the student to feel more comfortable in their learning enviroment and lern at their own pace. "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'

I honestly have no words for how insane this is. Scientists these days would do anything to create a machine more like a human. Now theyre asking machines to detect emotions, whats next. I for one do not think that they need to start making robots that will eventually take over the human race. this is ubsurd. Why would anyone trust machinery to detect emotions, why couldnt they have left Mona Lisa alone and just said that she looked happy and content? We do not need technology for anything! Especially not this.

Humans and machines do not need to communicate at all let alone ""emotionally communicate"". thats just wrong. Humans are humans and technology is technology. Advancements in technology shouldve stopped at smart phones. People wonder why half the stuff that goes on these days is so bad, its because we have allowed technology to come into our world and give people resources they never wouldve needed.

Computers and humans do not need to be related, they should stay seperate. no one in their right mind should want an emotional connection with a robot, thats wrong.

The use of this technology is to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable to me. There are reasons why I don't agree, and I know that i'm not the only person who disagree with this argument.

One reason is that schools shouldn't allow anyone to put that technology into their computers because that technology has nothing to do with school or what the kids are learning at school. Another reason is that the way people feel is how they feel, it's not meant for the whole world, the school, or anyone to know how they are feeling if they didn't tell that person. If that person didn't tell anyone that's because they wanted to keep what was wrong with them to their self.

In paragraph three it says that the Facial Action Coding System that is enable in computers can tell if a human is feeling happy, surprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness. If a student is feeling happy or surprise its okay for people to know, but when a sudent is feeling angry, disgust, fear, and sad it's not because you don't know what that person is going through or how that person is living.

This technology that someone came up with is not a good idea. I said it's not because I wouldn't want anyone to know how i'm feeling if i'm not in a good mood. If i'm angry or sad about something I would keep it to myself and not tell anybody because I wouldn't people to kee bringing it up to me when i'm trying to forget about it.",2,7,0.8671664595603943

I believe this type of technology is a great way to read students' emotional expressions for not only educational use but for human interactions.

FACS would be put into great use of technology for students' due to the amount stress, and confussion students' may be recieving, while doing assignments or assessments. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" (6) This type of technology, could provide a tutor to appear on the screen, and help the student with anything they are in need of. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (6) This may also result in ways students may accumulate these skills during musicals or plays.

Another way FACS could be used, is for human interactions. This may be useful for: family matters, employment, interviews, meeting someone. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.""

""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot whena a ""smiling"" polotician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" (8)

This is one big guess, this device can't tell you what facial musscles they're using because its not possible. What would the need for teachers be if a computer notices when someone gets bored? Why are we spending an outragous amount of money for a big waste of time?

In the first paragraph the author mentioned ""shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". I think this is very false evidence because how can a printer detect what facial musscles Mona Lisa used. Mona Lisa is a painting so how did she use any type of facial musscles. This is one of the many grey places i have with this topic.

If people acually have some depresson problems a fake smile won't be able to cheer them up. If somone is just sad in genral then you won't be able to detect what their emotion is because they could be using their real smile but still be hurting deep down. Most of the artist in our history were ""mad"" meaning they went crazy. Artist that were like mentally ill are crazy, you never know what was brewing through their head at the time of the painting.

what is the need for teachers? With the new technology why would we need teachers in the class. a computer that can detect if im board won't stop me from being bored. Anyone can slap something interesting in front of me but what about the kids who do nothing in school. This is why i think its all a bigh waste of money.

Mentally ill artist, depressed kids, and kids that do nothing in school, these all are scenarios of why not to get these Facial Action Coding Systems.

This technology couldn't be valuable to students in a classroom. The author states that Dr. Huang predicts, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" and then goes on to talk about how the computer would modify the lessons for the student. The computer could suggest the student is feeling one emotion but the student could really be feeling another. A student could be mad and irritated but the computer could suggest it is confused by the facial expressions the student is showing. A student could look tired but, could be feeling happy and the computer could suggest that the student is sad and miserable when in reality the student is just tired.

The article also states that Dr. Paul Eckman is using six basic emotions; happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. There are many more emotions that just these six, so when the computer is trying to calculate a facial expression it could be way off from how the student is really feeling since it is only using six basic emotions.

In my opinion, no, The Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable for students in a classroom. The system has only six basic emotions, which a student could be feeling none of. People don't know what another person is feeling by only looking at their facial expression. I don't agree that The Facial Action Coding System could know what a person is feeling just by seeing a facial expression especially if a human can't and I don't believe this system could be of any valuable use for a student in a classroom.",3,7,0.8833917379379272

Im siding for this as it can reveal a persons inner emotions and see if they are suffering on the inside out.

Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness- and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles,"" (D'Alto 1). This show how this new technology its valuable. The inventor of this with a psychologist study the emotions and then the movements of the facial muscles. This is important because we can conclude that the emotions and the expression in the Facial Action Coding System are real like the humans expressions and emotions.

Also people communicate more in facial expressions than in word ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication Dr. Huang, "" (D'Alto 1). This mean most humans communicate with expressions and not word. Its more easy for humans make a facial movement that express his emotion that tell someone how he feel.

The way the Facial Action Coding System would benefit students' is recognizing their emotions and facial expressions. It'd help the way they learn and what content is good in front of them. With certain material, all students interpret it in their own way. It would benefit how they feel about what is in front of them and what they're learning.

FACS would help others recognize emotions is because after using it and watching others, one would be educated on the technology and the way it works with humans. In the article it says that the system has up to 44 major face muscles working just like human muscles.

Empathy(feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" So after using the technology and practicing so much of feeling unknowingly, students would learn how to be emotionally healthy and how to balance their feelings.

FACS would benefit the students' and the way they learn by practicing keeping them alert during their lessons and schoolwork online. After the right content being provided due to their feelings and emotions, it would become natural for them to stay focused. In the article, D'Alto explains how one's feeling will trigger what is in the screen. He says, "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Students would be provided the right material as they go about the lesson.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding system would be very beneficial to student in a various amount of ways. The FACS would benefit students with recognizing emotions, benefit their feelings, and the students' education. FACS will better students and school systems.",4,7,0.8547075986862183

If a person wants to be happy all day let them be , and you can tell by thier face exprestion or by the actions they do through out the day..In paragraph three it's showing us by saying ""

raise your eyebrows when you're suprise ; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth)tighten your lips to show anger"" every person that i know off knows that .Why tell us information that we already know ? I get the person that trying to state there claim is trying to give us evidence and examples. In paragraph four it's telling us that when the software is tracking the persons emotion it shows them how many emotions they feel even if there mixed which agin doesn't make no sence for me because you can totally know or tell just by the person face expressing they do. In the very top off the article of mona lisa's picture you can totally see thats shes happy,ferful. And i only looked at the picture for some secounds which makes no sence of why i'll need a device to tell me how she feels. In paragraph six it's showing us that if your in a classroom confuse a teacher can stop the lesson and tell you which part you don't get . Which is good at some point it's not because what if the teacher stop because of one student and then seconds later or minutes later the person changes to a complety different mood . At the end i think that there's no need for you to know if the person if feeling bad or happy .What if the person is feeling not so good because of family issues? As a person , we wanna just move on and not remind are self of what just happen because it'll make us more disapointed then we already are. I think that less technoloy makes people less crazy and less stressful.

539508c,"Technology is rapidly advancing with each passing moment. Newer andfastertechnology is being used everyday making the world a better place. The world has also started implementing technology into the schools kids learn in today. The use of technology creates new ways of learning that can benefit students and make them better and brighter contributers to society.

The FAC or Facial Action Coding System can read emotions and put them into data. It has six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The FAC does this by making a computer 3D model and makes all 44 major muscles in the face and makes them function. By doing this, teachers could read students faces telling what kind of emotional state they're in. By cataloging each student with their current emotion, we can find out wht makes them hesitant to certian problems and what we can do to fix it.

Since emotion is a key part to human communication, the FAC is very benefical to the classroom. The face generates all emotions into a language that most people can read. The new technology can show the depth of emotion over great distances. This can proove benefical to students who take online classes via computer. The teacher/professor can not only communicate with students but can now distinguish areas of study that might frighten people sothat lesson plans may be adjusted. The technology could read how happy someone is who received a good test score or personal goal that a student has reached.

The FAC tells us emotions but what can we do to change people's current emotion. Studies show that when you make a face, you feel that emotion you're pretending to be in. The FAC could possibly ""prescribe"" the user an emotion to help them if they are sad. The users could then be prescribed a joke or something that will make them laugh or giggle. The happier a person is, wouldn't they be less doubtful and more confidant towards more challenging tasks.

The possibilties for this technology are endless. The FAC could revolutionize the way people learn. The FAC could tell teachers where they should focus more and where they should direct their attention. The FAC can also give the teachers a way to see into the type of learner people are and how they truely feel about caertain subjects. Another good use for this technology could be to prescribe a dose of happiness to students tobrighten their spirits to help them during a test. The FACis truely benfical to students in the classroom.",4,7,0.8792617917060852
5422580,"Prof. Thomas Huang, claims that the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), is able to detect a person's emotions by percentages. I believe that this system is foolish and is not accurate whatsoever. Although doctors and professors show that it is true, they do not truly know what that person is going through just by looking at their face. Some may say a raised eyebrow means somebody is suprised, but you never know if someone was born with that raised eyebrow and could possibly be sad or happy. This system does not seem to be accurate and should not be used in the future.

When figuring out somebody's feelings, only that person knows what they are feeling on the inside. By looking at someone's expressions, this does not do any justice, but listening to what they have to say and their tone of voice does the job. When hearing somebody's tone of voice, you can hear and feel their emotions. Also, some people may show their emotions by their artistic skills. Some may draw, write, build, etc. for they may have a hard time describing how they truly feel. Listening to what a computer has to say about someone does not seem accurate and just flat out sounds unreal.

Psychologists know the artistic technique as well. Some may even suggest to their patients to write in a journal or to draw how they feel. They can also know somebody's feelings when having a therapy session. They know when somebody wants to continue a conversation or put it to an end. It is all in that person's voice and they are professionals when doing this. Facial expressions may help in certain situations, but that is rarely. Somebody could come off as a wild and lively person, but on the inside they can be heartbroken and lonely.

I think by going up to someone and having a conversation is what is best to do, in order to see their emotions. Someone may look sad or even mad, but by going up them and talking to them, they could be the happiest person you know. Conversation is key and it is such a nice way to not only get to know somebody, but to also see how someone is feeling deep down. ",4,7,0.7824817895889282
5430e30,"In today's world there is a lot of amazing technology. Technology has come a long way than what it used to be. The technology that we use today is way better and hytech than what it has ever been before.

In this article there was a lot of talk on how computer here and their can do Facial Action Coding System. The Facial Action Coding System was created by Dr. Paul Eckman. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is designed to pick up every movement in a humans face and can determine different emotions with those sudden movements. There are six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Each and everyone of those emotions are determined by ones muscle movement in the face. I think the FACS is a very valuable piece of technology that can be used in the classroom for many different purposes. Some of the purposes are learning and just to have fun and mess around with each other to see what your emotions are and how you can change those emotions. The most important purpose for this new piece of technology is the learning purpose behind it. It can be used to learn many different things in a humans body and can learn the different muscles in ones face and how they differ from one to another. The article states that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, which means that different emotions can go to a different muscle movement in the face.

I think personally that this new peice of technology called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a very valuable thing for the classroom. It has many different learning objectives behind it and can be used for other activities besides learning purposes. Yes, also the technology that is around us today is amazing and is amazing what it can do. ",2,7,0.8523188233375549
547a912,"In the artical ""making Mona Lisa Smile"" the auther talks about the new technology called Facial Action Coding System. The new technology would be helpful in the classroom to identfy if students are bored or becoming bored. This passage states ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a strudent is becoming confused or bored,"" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" people understand human facial expression, computers need to know the same,because many hours of our lives are spent behind a computer screen.

Is facial expressions a science? Dr. Paul Eckman ""has classified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness"" these are all emotions we can see in person and we all respond differently when we see these emotions. In paragraph five ""For instance, you can tell gow a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.""

In conclusion the facial expressions read by humans everyday should be put into computers. In paragraph six it states "" ""Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang"" This is showing that people do not always talk about their feelings. ""so computers need to understand that,too"" said Dr. Huang ",2,7,0.8757730722427368

You would also know if that student had something really wrong with them like if something was going on outside of school or like at home or like if they just had something really heavy they needed to get off their chest and they probably just needed someone to talk to and you could be that person that could really help them out and be the one to lift their sperit up.",2,7,0.743878960609436
54f8ee6,"I think this techonology that reads the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could help others understand someones feeling.

These expressions are coming from the muscles in your body especially your face if you are using a lot of expression. ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This shows me ways you an figure out someones face expressions if they are serious or not. And it helps you out if they need any help. You could also tell by their muscles if you want to believe them or are they lieing just to get people to like them.

This technology could also be helpful because it could tell in school if you actually get it or you don't. ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The same techonology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-- for video games or video surgery."" This makes more sense why this techonolgy also could be helpful. This helps students more help and effort on their school works by using this techonology to notify a teacher because a lot of students doesn't want the whole class to know that they don't understand something.

This expression technology could help us understand our family or friends around us. ""Humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by thr look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually secribing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This shows me that this techonolgy can help you around your family or friends because they might be feeling a negative way and you should uderstand that by suing this techonology so you can understand more and make them feel better; same as if they are feeling positive you might need to continue having that positive vibe and you know that by using this techonology.

I agree with this technology because it shows someones feelings by telling through their muscles. You can tell if they need help or they aren't feeling good you can tell through a technology and you could help them out. This technology is a lot helpful in schools because it makes teachers understand more if students get it or not and they could help them out.    ",4,7,0.8060300350189209
5520857,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."", the author discusses the idea of using Facial Action Coding Systems in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System is a software that allows computers to read expressions of faces. For example, this program was able to detect that the Mona Lisa was, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" ( D'Alto 1-2) This technology could have a great impact on children in school. Putting computers with Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, in order to help read student's emotions and make the lesson more appealing to them, is a good idea.

The Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in classrooms. In most classrooms now, there are 20-30 students and only one teacher. This is a great responsiblity for a teacher to take on. With computers as help, learning in a classroom could be much more affective. Dr Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor."" Many children in classrooms can fall behind without one on one time with a teacher. However since classrooms are so big, it becomes less likely that a child who wants help actually gets the attention they need. With computers like these in classrooms, kids who need a little extra could get the practice without a teacher.

Although this technology could be life changing in many ways, it has its flaws. For example, we are still a long ways from being able to put these computers in every classroom. Also, the cost of this techonology is unknown. This could add to extra fees famlies have to pay when sending their child to school, some of which may not be ablee pay for this type of computer system. Even if the cost of these computers were low and they were able to be in every classroom, would they work properly all the time? Technology is not perfect and if the Facial Action Coding System is unrelable, then are they really worth the money?

Yes, these computers are worth the money. Despite all the possiblities that could go wrong with this technology, they still have great potential. Children would be getting a better education. Some students are ahead of others, and need more of a challenge. The Facial Action Coding System can help those who seem bored in class, which gives the children the oppertunity to learn more in a regular classroom setting. It also makes everyone in the classroom equal. While everyone is on the computer, it doesn't seperate those who need help from those who do. This will boost children's confidence and teach them to like school more while getting a better education at the same time.

There are several benefits to putting the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms in order to help read student's emotions and make the lesson more appealing. This system can help provide more challenging material and a oppertunity to learn more for the students who need it. It can also provide more help and extra lessons for the students who are behind in class. Overall, the Facial Action Coding System would help out teachers who have big classes. It would provide more one on one time for all students which would boost the rate they learn at, proving it is a good idea to have these types of computer systems in a classroom.

552ae9a,"The technology called Facial Action Coding System to identify human emotions should not be developed for a classroom environment. First of all, this software is still technology and can't always be accurate. There is also the problem where this technology would be too advanced and expensive to produce for most computers. Humans can also do a better job of telling emotions of others more than technology could.

The Facial Action Coding system cannot always be accurate. According to the article, humans make a variety of faces to show expressions everyday. The article explains this by saying, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)."" This shows that human expressions are not always the same and can vary depending on the individual making it hard for technology to detect the exact facial expression. This serves as a big problem when it comes to how the technology could work.

Other people could usually tell how they are feeling more easily than a computer could. The article states that friends can usually tell how they are feeling by looking at their facial expressions. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This shows that humans can usually tell how they are all feeling simply by looking at eachothers expressions. Others might argue that some people have a harder time seeing what their friends feel and that this software would help them undrestand better.

A computer has to look at millions of other peoples expressions and try to tell how they are feeling,while people can usually tell what individuals they see everyday are feeling.

The technology and money needed for installing this onto school computers would be way too expensive. The article even states this by saying that home computers would not be abke to handle the algorithms needed for this software. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This quote shows that the average PC would not handle what is needed for the software to work. To get the computers needed, you would have to replace all the school computers with newer ones that could handle the capabilities.

What is needed to produce these has far more negatives than positives. For example, you would have to replace all computers with newer more advanced ones to help with the lack of computers that can handle this software. Further more teachers would not have to figure out what students are feeling by themselves making it harder for them when the software breaks down. Also the teachers could more easily tell what their students feel without the software as technology is not always accurate.      ",4,7,0.8682327270507812

Those emotions can be portrayed on a human or on a painting scuh as, The Mona Lisa. This new technology, Facial Action Coding System, is valuable. It is valuable because it can figure out exactly what someone was feeling and it could help schools.

Now, figuring out exactly what someone was or is feeling may not be so important to you. It could be very important though. For example, in the passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", paragraph 1, the author tells us exactly how Mona Lisa was feeling. She was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. For the moste part she was happy right? But what about the 17% of her feelings that were filled with disgust, fear, and anger. Whatwas causing those feelings. Think about it. If we can figure out exact emotions of people from the past, we could dig in and find out a lot more about our world's history. Those 17% of emotions could be nothing at all, but what if it was a major. What if it was something we didn't know about her.

This new technology could also help out schools. In aragraph 6, the author talks about how the Facial Action Coding System could potentially improve classrooms. That would result in smarter people in this world which is great. The technology could read your facial expressions to see if you are bored. If you are bored, then the technology could improve the classroom to be more interesting to you. If you are more interested in the subject at hand, then you will understand it better. If you understand it better, you will have better grades and have more knowledge. This will ultimately result in smarter people in the world.

So the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It can help us find exact emotions of a person. It could help us with with our schooling. We could find out so much more about our world and increase the IQs of others. This system could be so important for our world. ",4,7,0.8006648421287537

My dog growls when he vplays what dose it mean? Maby later on they can move on from human faces to other animal faces.

Dr. Paul Eckter man has alot of good idals with his program. He just needs it were the people can turn it on and off othere than being on all the time. like how when some people are angry they turn tv on or funny videos. That could turnout to becume disaster.

One way that facial recognition can be helpful, is that it can be used in classrooms to better the learning enviornment. According to paragraph 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomig confused or bored."" This can be useful for many teachers who have studnets that are confused but don't want to speak up. This can be very helpful for schools and change the way we learn for the better.

Another reason facial recognition can be useful, is in relationships and partnerships . Many people say that they can't tell how their friend or partner is feeling, but with this new software you just might be able too. In the passage it states that ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on his/her face. Of course, most of us would have toruble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" We might have had trouble detecting those emotions in the past, but not anymore. With this software you can always tell if your friend or partner is angry, sad, worried, or in trouble.

Lastly, one of the most important reason to why we need this computer software is for medicine. According to the passage, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games and video surgery."" If doctors had this kind of technology to use for video surgery, it could change how we precieve medicine. This can make videos more realistic for new surgeons that are trying to learn how to operate. It could save someone's life.

With all of the infromation we have learned from the passage, I think that it is safe to say that this new facial recognition facial software is going to help us in the long run to better the way we learn and change the way we think.        ",4,7,0.7883826494216919

I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to read students' emotional expressions.

Having the capability to detect students' emotions through computers can have many positive outcomes, such as promoting ads, increasing learning comprehension, and graphic design improvements.

The use of this technology having the abililty to read one's emotions, can be valuable in the fact that it can promote ads more efficiently.

In paragraph 6, they say, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""

This phrase prevails how if the computer can detect your emotions, it can also detect how you feel about a promotion.

This will help sell more products for companies, and help buyers get information on what they are actually interested in.

This new software will also come in handy in increasing learning comprehension.

It states in paragraph 6 that Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This statement makes logical sense, in the fact that a student may be able to understand his or her work better if a Facial Action Coding System computer is available.

This could possibly increase literacy rates, simply due to the fact that a computer can detect facial expressions.

Another reason that these new devices are beneficial is because they can improve graphic designing.

This makes video games, video surgery, graphic models, and other animated subjects more realistic.

Dr. Huang also states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to undertand that, too.""

Although the technology can be very valuable in the classroom, it can have a downside, however.

Having Facial Action Coding System computers can result in miscommunications.

Paragraph 3 states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions--happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.""

A student learning a lesson on a computer may have a frown on their face because they are having a bad day.

The computer may pick up this emotion, and mistake it for not understanding what is being taught.

All technology is capable of having mishaps.

This new device may not be guaranteed to be 100% accurate at all times.

Facial Action Coding system seems to rate all of the Mona LIsa's emotions from what she feels the most to least. Clearly stating that the Coding system ranks all emotions from least to greater. Not specifing what a peson is feeling.

Futher more, the Facial Action Coding system is a great tool for everyday life, but not it's not useful in the classrom. Using this device will not only waste valuable time to teach but its also lacking accuracy. ",3,7,0.8424018621444702
56e11a2,"Have you ever wanted to know exactly how somone is feeling? What if you were telling your friend a story and you truly wanted to know if they found it interesting? The latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe can detect the emotions of someone by calculating the way the subject's facial structure and muscles form the six basic emotions, which are happiness, surpries, anger, disgust, and fear. This system is called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and can be used for many different reasons. One example is in the cassroom. With the FACS, teachers will be able to read the emotional state of their students, plan/adjust lessons based on the readings, and bring a happier, more interesting experience to the classroom.

The FACS has the ability to read emotions based on muscles and face composition. Tests have been done on one of the most famous paintings in history, ""Mona Lisa"". While this technology can be trivial, as reading a painting-woman's face is not completely productive, it can be helpful towards teachers and students. If the teacher has the ability to truly understand and read their student's emotions, the teacher can switch up and have the ability to try something new. For example, if a student's structure reads that (s)he is confused, the teacher can either go more in depth into the lesson and explain further as to avoid any more confusion. This is exactly what Dr. Huang has predicted, saying that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" in paragraph 6.

Bringing the FACS into the classroom will not only allow teachers to see how bored and confused their students are, it can force the teacher to be innovative and creative in their lesson plans. If the teacher truly cares for their students' attention, (s)he would have to implement new ways to teach boring subjects, in which most students would clock out of otherwise. Most students dread long lectures and usually either stop paying attention, thus wasting both the teacher's and student's time, or forget most of the information. With the FACS, teachers will be able to detect signs of boredom and dread and then capitalize on their emotions with a new activity or fun game to lighten the students' moods, while also giving them the proper amount of information.

Much like the example above, there are ways for teachers to bring a lighter-toned, more fun energy to the classroom with this system. If the teacher sees that the students are boerd, in a lecture for exapmle, the teacher could implement a game or fun activity. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, as explained in paragraph 9, if someone is putting on a happy face, even if they do not mean it, they are subconciously happy and are having a good time. If the students are doing a fun activity together, they are surely going to smile, giving off positive vibes and general happiness in response to an otherwise boring lesson.

The FACS is a revolutionary way of processing emotions and can be really helpful for any student-teahcer learning environment. The system can allow teachers to read what their students are feeling, and can either hcange a lesson plan to reduce confusion, or implement activities or games to increase happiness and positivity during a dreadful lecture. The FACS in the classroom will help both teachers and students alike.",6,7,0.8977950811386108
56efbd2,"Have you ever gone to school feeling sad, depressed, anxious, gloomy, alone and no one asks you about it?, have you ever just wanted someone to understand that your feeling a certain way, do you think maybe things would be different if someone could detect what was going on. Now there is way of making this happen, its called ""Facial Action Coding System"" it anables computers to identify human emotions just by taking a glance.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face and all 44 major muscles move like real human muscles. They create an action unit then they clasify each movement and muscle used to describe what emotion is being transmitted. Could you imagine having a computer be you're friend, I could. I think this system would improve not only the learning cuality but it would improve students to get help if they ever need it, teenage years are hard sometimes and adding school stress to them can be harsh, this computer would detect if any student ever had a problem with their mental health and we could solve those silent problems before they get out of hand.

Acoording to the article ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" these features could help speed up the learning process and give every student exactly what they need to get all of their learning done.

This technology could adjust to everyones needs and we could become better everyday, the future depends on the little details we need to fix, I think complementing this system would be a great way to start making a change.

My argument may or or may not influence your point of view on this new technology, but after everything we all go for the pusuit of happiness.               ",3,7,0.8573347330093384
56fcc78,"I believe that the use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom or the community around us. This technology would help show how others are feeling when they are hiding their emotions. This would help because since the Facial Action Coding System is pretty accurate, we are able to use this in future generations to specify emotions from other people and know how they are feeling to help those around us in the world.

When people are sad, mad, or even fearful, we can help those around us who are feeling down and comfort them. We can bring joy in the world by the people who are enjoying life and be with those who are happy by bringing those who are sad, mad, and fearful into the ""happy"" environment so they don't have to worry. Studies show in this article that, ""'Most of us have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys... specific emotion.' and also, 'Most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' Dr. Huang predicts."" This proves that since not many of us in this world knows what our expressions are to see our specific emotion, especially during nonverbal communication, it would be best to see what their real emotions are and know what they are going through (or if they're just fine) and ask if they want help or need comfort. We could help out others who are going through things even if they don't need help. If they don't want to be comforted, we can always respect their privacy. But it would be best to know what others go through to respect those around us more often. We shouldn't offend and judge people in general because we don't know what others go through and how they feel when we do judge and offend them. It would be kind and respectful to help those out around us to make the world a better place.

This system would help to read emotional expressions in a classroom because it would help the learning environment and the students in the class when the teachers are teaching. This would especially help the teachers more because teachers have trouble knowing what students are going through and can help their students out during class if they need help when they are troubled in their subject of math, science, English, ect. Most of the time, students don't want to let the teachers know if they're worried about an assignment or sad about their grade and don't want to get help from the teachers. If teachers knew their students emotions, they would have a better interaction and communication with their students and help them learn better in class, understanding the subject more. Studies show in this article that, ""'A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor.""' This proves that since teachers want their students to be successful in their subjects, this system could help students and especially teachers to know when to help each other out when they are confused on a specific part in the subject and have a better understanding in the subject when the teachers do help out the students. This could also help because when a student is going through something and is distraced in class, the teacher would know their emotion and take it easy on them during class and help out the student with their problem and what they go through to have a better understanding and interaction with the student.

In conclusion, The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom and the community around us to help those around us in the world and get a better understanding of people and their emotions to make the world a better place to live in by comforting others who need help and showing kindness.

5700ff4,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System should become part of the technology used in classrooms. This technology would not only be a scientific break through, but would also provide a alternative to how efficently students learn.

Althoguh the creation of the Facial Action Coding System was recent, the idea of the technology has been around for centuries. Dr. Thomas Huang, co-creator of the software, claimed that much more simplified versions of the software have been used for for a long time. The professor claimed that artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci, studied anatomy to be able to make anthropomorphic figures as naturalistic as possible. The artist would use their knowledge of anatomy to create naturalised facial muscles, which would accurately reflect emotions of the subjects. But this technology could help not only the artistic community, but entire generations.

Dr. Huang strengthens his argument for the emotion-reading software by claiming its benefitial usage in the classroom. Dr. Huang said, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The professor is predicting that with the help of his software, the way children learn could be changed for the better. With the help of this software, students would be able to focus on topics longer, whic poses a problem for many students today. Students would be able to learn or strenghten skills without having to voice their boredom or confusion with topics. This would benefit them as they grow because they would be able to fully understand topics and skills insteading of falling behind simply becasue they lose interest. For example, a young student would be able to learn multiplication possibly faster and stronger than older students because with this software, they would be able to focus on each problem. As the child grows, they have a less likely chance of falling behind in other mathmatical courses because they have no need for relearning multiplication, and are able to solve problems quickly because they know what they are doing. Also, multiplication is all over the world, so they would be comfotable to use it in their day to day life. In the end, this child was able to succeed with a mathmatical skill simply because of a facial software that kept them involved and growing in their studies.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding Sysem should be active in classrooms because it provides great value to education.",4,7,0.8182200193405151

So that is why that gave her own picture of herself and the computer model picture is a little bit better than the orignal one. The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens her lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of her picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence.

5719378,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS)is a recent innovation in facial recognition software. It can deciper what a perosn may be feeling by analysing muscle movements and facial structure. While the technological impact of FACS is revolutionary, can a sytem like it be used in schools to give insight into the emotions of a student? The value of FACS in schools has the ptoential to become great, but as of now, FACS still has many challenges to face in order for it to become a practical and valuable part of the education sytem.

Currently, FACS can only recognize ""...six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."". While this abilty is a great acheviment, FACS would have to be able to read many more expressions, such as confusion, boredom, or understanding to become useful in a classroom enviornment.

If implemented in its current state, FACS might look at each student's face and would be able to pinpoint only the happy or suprised students, but typically, the happy students are not be the ones who need help. Without the capabilities to recognize more emotions, FACS would serve little purpose in this setting.

The artical also states that "" Your at home PC can't handle the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Many school comtuters are out of date and wouldn't be able to run FACS either. So, in order to correctly use it, a school would have to spend large amounts of money to purchase machines with the computing power to run FACS, an investment that may not pay off for years. This expense would only be made greater by the cost of the software itself.

So, while the Facial Action Coding Sytem has the ability to become an integral part of the education sytem, with its current capabilities, it would seem that FACS is not yet ready to assume the role of a valuable tool in classrooms arcross the country.      ",4,7,0.8937571048736572

It can help change emotions by showing different thing on the computer screens,for and example a student can be sad and the facial regonition can see that he/she is sad and then put something thats joyful on the screen.

The computer can tell if the a student is pretending to be happy or sad by your mucles. Pretending to be happy or sad will cause the symstem to bringout the student real emotions. Most students try to act sad to bring atttion to themselves. If a student appears sad to another student the other students tends to comfront him/she in the wrong way.                                           ",2,7,0.8506675958633423

Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happy, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with your characteristic movement of the facial muscle. If you're mad your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger, your muscles on your face shows the computer what you're feeling. Dr.Huand new system can even identify mixed emotions because each expression is compared against a neutral face.

5736882,"The Facial Action Coding System would not be very useful in the classroom because most teachers do not change their lesson just because one of their students is confused or bored, the FACS is not even able to read past the basic six emotions so it will not know when a student is bored or confused, and most teachers do not use computers all the time or even at all in class.

Teachers do not change their lesson when one of their students is bored or confused. Everyone that has been in school is well aware of this. Most teachers do try to make it less boring and more fun if multiple students are feeling the same and they do try to explain things better for those that are confused. A computer that ""senses"" when a student is becoming bored or confused, will not be able to do the same and have the same result. The FACS could help the computer see that a student is becoming bored and modify the lesson, but how much help would that be? People learn better when other people are there to explain things. A computer cannot provide the same effect.

According to the fourth sentence in paragraph three, the FACS only knows how to read the six basic emotions-- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Meaning that the FACS would not actually be able to tell if the user or student is bored or confused. If the program cannot actually sense those two emotions, how will it be able to modify lessons for students to learn a little better without being confused? In paragraph four, it does mention how the software can identify ""mixed emotions"" but it would ot be very helpful for those two considering that they are harder to tell by just looking at someone's face when it is better to ask.

Most teachers do not use computers in class often. Sometimes, they do not use them at all. Unless the students are in a typing class or a program coding class, teachers for other subjects rarely use computers outside of taking tests or doing projects. They rarely ever trust a computer to teach their lessons for them. That is why they are called ""teachers"". So the FACS software program would merely go to waste.

The Facial Action Coding System would not best suit being in classrooms since the teachers do not change their lessons so the computers should not either, humans express way more than just six emotions and a computer would not be able to detect them all, and very few teachers actually have full computers in their classrooms to help them teach instead of small laptops or just very little technology altogether.",4,7,0.8247225284576416
57605e0,"In the article they are talking about a new technology called Facial Action Coding System where the computer can identify human emotions. I think that this new technology can be very valuable for teachers in schools to know when a student is sad or upset. The computer can help a teacher/adult to understand when a student is in need of a talk or needs to express their emotions. This is also very valuable because it could potentially save a life in bad situations. The computer facial coding system is valuable in my opinion for various reasons as you may see in this essay.

This system can alert a teacher or anyone when there might be something wrong with a person, whether it is good or bad. To be able to understand how a person feels may be one of the best new technologies created. Knowing when a person is feeling sad, angry, happy, etc, can really be great for if they need someone to talk to. It could make things better or make things not so good. Just having those options of emotions to be recognized is something very amazing. Even though this system can't contol your emotions or thoughts, it can really help to understand when there is something good or bad going on.

In the conclusion to figuring out if this new technology system is valuable, it most certainly is. It can be useful in many ways. I think another use for this could be in hospitals to detect if a patient is lying about their emotions. Even though a patient in a hospital may not like this because it can see their true emotions, it might be able to help them in the long run. If this technology can help manage what another person is feeling then it can make them see whats really going on, even if they lie about it.

In a lot of ways I disagree on this new facial coding because it's not others people' s businesse to know how other's feel about what their doing. I am sure others would feel unconfertable knwoing that other people around know how you feel all the time. Somethimes when you feel alone or sadness and you don't want others to know because your not ready to tell them what's been going on and because of the Facial Action Coding System people would feel like they don't have their own personal space to think about themselfs and knowing how they feel about something.

In some ideas I agree with the article is when in the article it said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" I agree on that statement; to use this new technology for educational purposes as long as no student or teacher abusses it to know what are others feeling about you or something else. It also a good idea to use it when someoone is really depressed about something and if you feel something is gonna happen to the person and you can tell an adult to help with the problem. Is not right for someone else to know your feelings, people have no right to know what someone else is feeling because people can take advangen of someones feelings and use it agaisnt them and can hurt someone for ever and maybe it can affect someone's life in the future.

At the end people still have no business to mess or know how someone feels becuase that's the other person personal feeling but at some point the Facial Action Coding System can be useful in school because it can detect if someone is confused or having trouble understanding the assignment or chapter their going through.

Using a software to read emotional expressions just isn't needed in a classroom. Theres really just no need for it and it would be a waste of money. We can already tell when someone is sad, mad, or happy when you look at there face . There would just be no need to replace that.

If a classroom would want to use this technology they would need a fast computer and sit the student down to check there emotions.

Aswell as the cost of these software programs. Aswell as the cost of faster computers.

I don't think this technology would be useful in any classroom. Not even a classroom computer would be able to run the software in the first place.

57fcfea,"Mapping the Thoughts of Students

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" advancing technology used for recognizing human emotion is suggested for use in the classroom. By having a computer be able to register the emotions of a student and adjust the lesson accordingly using a program called Facial Action Coding System, student productivity will excel, and the stress felt by teachers will ease.

Lessons, for as long as education has existed, have been adjusted accordingly to the audience by the tutors. For instance, a teacher may observe their students leaning forward in interest of the lesson, and may continue based off of that subject. Others may see students slump in their chairs, or watch with glossy, bored eyes, and will attempt to reconnect with the class. Facial recognition is already common. ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day (Paragraph 5)."" But it is done ineffectively in the classroom due to one person teaching twenty others. A computer is unbiased, and only focuses on one body: The user. By reading and calculating the most subtle changes in one's face, beyond what the naked eye can see, a computer is able to follow ""emotion algorithms"" and change the lesson's strategy ""...like an effective human instructor (Paragraph 6)."" The lesson becomes personalized, benefiting the student greatly, as if they had their own private tutor. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (Paragraph 6)."" The student will understand quicker and learn at a greater rate than if they simply sat and listened to an adult stand at the front of the classroom.

In turn, this student productivity will drastically lower the stress and pressure a teacher will feel over their students. Teachers, more often than not, truly care if their students understand what is being taught and want to see them succeed. Teachers, however, do not have the time to focus on each student individualy. By watching a student fail, a teacher feels as if they themselves are failing. With emotion tracking classroom computers, each student has a better chance of succeeding. A student, who has mastered balancing chemical equations, will no longer have to 'start back at square one' with another student who knows nothing of math or chemistry. Students who fall behind more often will be more equal with their quicker classmates. On a whole, the class itself will be more productive, and the teacher may even be able to move on and prepare more advanced lessons. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (Paragraph 4)."" The focus the computer has on the student can be greater, and more effective, than what a single adult can provide. Teachers will feel more at ease knowing their students have the 'attention' they need for more challenging subjects.

Facial recognition is not a new concept, and has existed even before the invention of computers. Efficiency is what has been changing, and for the better. If computers, able to recognize and adapt according the user's emotions, better a student's productivity and reduce a teacher's stress, Facial Action Coding Systems are of great value in the classroom.",6,7,0.8927800059318542

The emotions are not necessarily that important when it comes to teaching. Students get angry, sad, happy, and more all the time during school. Knowing when a student is happy or mad is not going to help a teacher do their job.

Feelings are a normal part of life and everyone experiences them. However, during school a teacher does not necessarily need to know your emotions unless you want them to. A teacher knowing that a student is upset might be a good thing. Dont get me wrong, I have had teacher's before ask me if I were okay and it was nice to know that they cared but there shouldnt be a machine to tell you that.

Teacher's knowing that youre upset is one thing, I completely understand a teacher wanting to know if there is anyway they can help you when you are upset but a teacher does not need to know that youre extra happy or mad at your best friend unless you want them to know.

587f42e,"Do you think that the use technology is valuable for detecting emotional expressions? well I think that it is not valuable for us. I will be naming some reason why in this essay. If you are intrested in knowing more of why it wouldn't be valuable for us please read on.

A reason that I think that this type of technology wouldn't be valuable to us because I don't think it is important to try to understand how someone feels or what emotions they are having at that moment. They probably wouldn't want you to know because if they did they would probably tell you. It's none of our business honestly, however how we be for sure that this type of technology would even work. There is supposed to be 44 major facial muscles in our face and the computer is supposed construct that using a 3-D model but what happenes if it misses a muscle and the calculations are all wrong. Then you wouldn't exactly know what they are really feeling. The computer would not be giving you the excat emotion.

Also, There is a mucle called orbiculars oculi pars palpabraeus that makes crow's feet around your eyes, so if computers scans someone's face that has that then the computer would give out false information about the person is feeling just because of the face when this person could really happy. Another muscle that is created is called the risorius that could put on a false smile that make your mouth skretch sideways creating a smile that could make you look happy when your actually sad. The computer could also scan a person like that and would again give false information. I believe that the computer can be wrong because everything won't be correct as they should be.

Another way, is that a person could just not smile at all like how Mona Lisa was once before and they could be extremly happy, but if a computer were to scan how that the computer would give results of sadness but that is not actually how the person is feeling. Computers just can't calculate how a person is feeling 100 percent of the time and be correct about it. Yes, a computer can communicate with humans but not emotionally. This is a new type technology can have it's ups and downs but I think that it will have more downs than ups.

However, another mucsle called frontalis pars lateralis could make you seem suprised just by raising an eyebrow but that doesn't always mean your confused or shocked it could mean many other things. The computer can calculate that your confused just by raising your eyebrow because it could calculate your face expressin not emotion. Facial expressions are universal and could all mean different things and a computer wouldn't clearly be able to tell how someone is feeling. Dr. Huang observed the artist da vinci for human anatomy to help paint mucsles precisely but his software only have similar anatomical information as electronic code, so his software doesn't the exact electronic codes it need so it could be wrong about how people are feeling.

To hence, I don't think that technology to read emotions are valuble because the computer could be wrong and not give the exact emotion, it could falsly give how someone is feeling due to a muscle in a persons face to make them look a certain way, and that the computer could not create the exact face because it mioght miss a muscle and give the wrong expression.

58b61cc,"While the idea of using a Facial Action Coding System in the educational process would certainly be interesting, I do not think it is nearly advanced enough to be able to be used in modern schools. While the technology may be able to find the hidden emotions behind the famous portrait Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, that does not mean it is in a position to help students learn. Simply put, the Facial Action Coding System does not have the viability, efficacy, or privacy needed in order to supplement learning.

Even if we allowed camera's to scan the faces of students in school, we would not be able to decode their emotions in a speed befiting our educational system today. At the seventh passage, the author states that, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting. Even if a school had the funds to buy a computer that could process the data quickly enough to be useful, there are simply too many students for that one computer to process, which would make the entire system useless.

If we were to simply put that first fact aside and instead look at the ability for this technology to assist students in an ideal setting, we still find that students can fake their emotions in order to cheat the system. In the third passage of the artice, the author states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,"" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.

The idea of being able to find out the emotions of all of the chidlren in a school on a whim also rises privacy concerns that would need to be addressed before any program including this software would be implemented. The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children.

Because of the lack of availablity, the potential cheating of the software, and the privacy concerns involved, the Facial Action Coding System is not able to be used in its current state to benefit schools. While this technology could be used in the future to help students, for example students with mental disabilities, it is not able to do so as it is now. It will be interesting to see what this and similar technologies grow to be, for better or for worse.",6,7,0.800029456615448
58c1bd1,"I think The Facial Action Coding System should be put into classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System is a system that enables computers to identify human emotions. This a real system that actually works it scans your face to see what emotions you have.

In order for this to work the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. I think the use of this in a classroom is going to workout great for the students and the teachers. If you have the Face Action Coding System in the classroom the teachers can scan the faces of there students will the teacher is teaching them a lesson. After it scans the faces of the students the teacher can then see if the students are enjoying the lesson or if they aren't enjoying. This could change the way teachers teach kids by doing stuff creative different days so the kids will enjoy what they are being taught. Instead of being upset about what they are learning.

This is also a good idea for teacher as well to see if there students are having a hard time or if they are upset about something. Some kids don't like to talk about what they are upset about unless someone ask them first. The face scaning decive will be a helpful thing to put in a classroom. plsu while your face is geting scanned you have to make a happy face therefore the experiment will make you slightly happy. I think they should start putting these in the classrooms now.

Having these in the class will make kids want to learn and the teachers will be able teach the kids because the kids will be focused. It will be a great thing to have in a school it's always good to see the emotions of the kids in the classroom. Even for the teachers if the teacher is uspet the students can see his emotions with the face scanner. All in all i think they should start putting them in classrooms. I am for the use of this technology as me being a student i think something like this would be a cool thing to have in my school. ",3,7,0.8104517459869385
58f18bb,"I think that we should have this Facial Action Coding System. It can make teaching much easier for a teacher and learning much easier on students. The FACS can change just about everything we know about human emotions. This could be a new way to help people in classrooms and people with depression.

Since this FACS was made we are able to better understand how people are feeling. Wethier its in the classroom helping the teacher better engage his or her students into there lesson, or its helping someone who dosent want to show emoting get help with something thats bothering them.Since the face can show so much more emotion than we can normally see we are able to see deeper down at what they are actually feeling. As in paragraph 6 it quotes ""A Classroom coumputer could recognzer when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrutor."" Knowing that many people dont want to be in a classroom there whole day this system will be able to change there action of study to where its more enjoyable for the student to sit there and actually learn about the material.

As it goes to show the FACS would be a great thing to have because it would greatly help out in so many different ways. With this new technology we will be able to better our school learning systems. We will be able to better our world with better learning systems.",3,7,0.8304535150527954

One way that this facial coding machine can also help is by detecting whether someone is happy, sad or angry. Some textual evidence that supports this is ""She's 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" These are just a couple things this facial coding device can detect.

A couple other things that this facial coding can detect is whether you are lying and fake smiling. Some text evidence that proves this facial coding machine can do that is ""But in a false smile, the mouth isTo an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

591c21a,"Today, technology in classrooms is huge. Almost all classrooms use technology nearly everyday. However, not everyone of them is effective because they are easier to slack off on without having a human to tell them to continue on even after they are bored, tired and even confused. Dr. Thomas Huang decided to create a system to help with this problem. He made a system called FACS or Facial Action Coding System. This system on a computer, reads emotions that on displayed on peoples face.

There are 44 major muscles in the human face. Each one of these muscles helps researchers find new ways to read emotions. Dr. Thomas Huang is one of these researchers. Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"". He means by this that because there are so many different muscles in your face, and them all being able to show different emotions, there is an endless amount of expressions to be made. For example, you can probabaly read your friends face and see what kind of day they are having by reading the emotion on their face. Unlike the smart Facial Action Coding System, we are not able to completely describe each facial trait showed by our friend, although we can still tell their state of emotion. For example when using FACS, researchers were able to tell that Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry.

It is thought that the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could help students better in the classrom. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Haung predicted. He also stated that if the FACS could recognize taht on students faces, it could also modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor would. Dr. Huang also states ""Most human communication is nonverball, including emotional communication,"". Even though this system could prove to be effective, not all students are only learning on computers and are learning verbally from a teacher. A teacher is unable to identify the exact percent of each emotion you feel but can still read your emotions just as your friend would.

Nick D'Alto, the author of Making Mona Lisa Smile, gives us an example of demonstration we could try. ""While looking in the mirror: 1. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. 2. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling ('crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. 3. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes."". By having a partner guess which emotion your are portraying, he is doing as the FACS would. Your partner probabaly would have guessed happy. The computers would have been able to tell that you are feeling happy, and continue on with your work. However, if you were to have been looking confused, the computer would stop, and try to help explain the problem to you.

The computers could very easily help in the classrooms to make students work to the best of their ability. By being able to read emotions, the computers will make it harder for students to slack off while previoulsy it would have been moderatly easy. Humans perform these face ""calculations"" everyday without realizing it. Now the FACS system can join along with us and then some by creating a better work environemnt for the students. ",3,7,0.8707652688026428
5920041,"I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can prove how a person is feeling due to having a 3-D computer model, an electronic code, and a facial software.

First, the FACS has a 3-D computer model to help it figure out a persons emotion. In the text it says, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a humans muscles."" This evidence shows that a humans facial muscles shows how a person is feeling and each emotion has their own charateristics.

Second, the FACS also has an electronic code which helps the system understand better the emotion just kanda how us as humans can tell if our friend is upset or happy. For example in the text it says, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This evidence shows that the software has the same kind of thing that lets us humans know how our friend is feeling.

Lastly, the facial software helps FACS by using human features on the face understand the emotions. In the article it says, ""muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus makes crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This evidence shows that even a computer software can tell what you're feeling by your face features.

I think the FACS should be used to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom. Having a 3-D computer model, an electonic code, and a facial software sure can all help Facial Action Coding System recongize a humans emotion.",2,7,0.8861998319625854
5948fc6,"Have you ever heard of FACS? FACS stands for Facial Action Coding System. This type of technology can supposedly read your facial expressions. When I heard of this I wanted to believe but I just couldn't. I didn't think it was valuable enough to consider. I found too many flaws in the system from the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto.

In this article I found many things that I need to point out. The article states ""New software has been developed that improves accurracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The reason I include this is because there is a key word that some of us might skip over. The word that they use is improve. But before in the passage they claim it can detect the emotion. Now it is saying it can only improve on what we as humans can do.

What is not right about it either is it only includes major muscles, 44 to be exact. But thats not the point, the point is that it doesn't include many small features in the face. So this system isn't as accurate as it sounds. The small features if they included them would make it more accurate and then they could make the claim that it is 100% accurate.

In paragraph 6 they do have an ok point. The passage states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could change the lesson."" If this was the case you would still have many students that would get bored for any lesson. Those computers aren't garunteed to teach them the standards that mybe the state requires. We haven't even talked about expenses. This must cost a fortune for a whole school and some schools would be left out of this. They wouldn't be given the same education of many other students around the United States.

So to wrap this up I don't think it is very valuable to have this in a classroom setting. Maybe in the future we might be able to have something like this where everything is changed. With the circumstances right now no way could this work. Too much effort has to go into this and technology is getting out of hand anyway.",3,7,0.7138118743896484
5970470,"How accurate is a computer? Answer? As accurate as it is programmed. When it comes to facial expression the technology used is programmed by one psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman. How can one man be responsible for knowing and understanding every human emotion? How could recognizing the face of a student in school help them to learn better? Using the technology from ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" for emtional scanning in school may not be as valuable as it seems.

In my OTHER_PII experience you can never actually tell how a person is feeling just by looking at them. I am a pretty good example myself. I have some pretty bad ""dead"" face. People ask me all the time if I'm ok and I always say, ""Yea I'm just tired"", because I am just tired. I'm fine but others don't seem to think so because of the way my face is. Other kids and teenagers probably have this problem too. Having a computer try to cheer them up if they're ok isn't going to help. In the text they describe the situation as such, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I find that line amazing. ""Effective human instructor"". That could mean many things. But how exactly could it modify the lesson to be more interesting and who is to say what an effective human instructor is?

How exactly is the modified lesson even going to help interest the student? Pop up a short game for a break or show a funny piture and tell the student to cheer up? Each child learns differently so how can a computer detect that? If computers started becoming ""effective human instructors"" what would happen to future teaching jobs? All of these questions are left unasnwered. As respectful as Dr. Huang puts it in paragraph 6, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."", I can agree with the computers learning about us but who would teach or program them?

What about flaws in the computer system? What if it reads certain faces wrong such as those with disabilities or who have been in accidents where the face is not recognizable by the system? Those children would not get the full effective education as those around them and it also derives a sense of difference from other students and leaves them subject to outcasting and even bullying. There are times in a school system where the teachers and administrators need to think about the good of the students before their education sometimes. The cost to implement this new technology could also be an issue. To install the technology they would either have to go through every computer in the school system or get rid of them and buy whole new sets of computers to be able to use them effectively. How much would a school system be willing to pay to boost the education of a student and give them the best opportunity to thrive in school.

As I have previously stated there are too many questions left unanswered. I see the potential it might have in the future. And how it could be used for the better but unless solutions to the questions I have asked are not answered then how can the system that recognizes facial emotions truly be trusted in schools?                            ",4,7,0.815399706363678
597f576,"The technological age has advanced to the point of being able to calculate the complex emotions of the Mona Lisa, and there's proposal for moving into classrooms as well. However, this is a sentiment that must be rejected wholeheartedly. Despite possible learning benefits, facial recognition technology in the classroom would be ineffective and would constitute an invasion of privacy.

Facial recognition software would be an ineffective addition to the classroom environment. In paragraphs 5 and 6, D'Alto writes of how the computer can sense emotions just like humans can, stating, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" The human body has a natural ability to sense emotions within others by performing calculations based on the subtle body movements of others. Even if a machine could replicate this, as the article suggests, it doesn't dimish the face that humans already possess this capability. No emotion detecting software currently available provides anything that a human being couldn't detect, therefore adding them to the classroom would only be providing information that the teacher could already know. Teachers can detect boredom, stress, and enjoyment just like the computer would, and, if they so wish, they can change their lesson appropriately. Technology that reads emotions would be innefective and unneeded in the classroom.

Software that can read emotions could, in a classroom, invade the personal, privite lives of the students its watching over. Due to the nature of being a computer, the technology could, as stated in paragraph 6, ""'...recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" The level of understanding stops at simply recognizing the emotion; a computer cannot discern the reason behind each emotion because it only detects that the emotion is there. Now place that into a classroom, where students from all different backgrounds are coming together to learn, and there will be some students that have had a rough day. Something happened outside of school that was out of their control, and they're just trying to make it through the day and avoid conversation about it. Sadly, they walk into class, and a computer, which a teacher is giving a lesson, notices that the student is distracted and continually pesters them to pay attention, even though the student's interest is not on schoolwork at all. Life is not contained to just the classroom, and external factors will effect a student's emotion before, during, and after class. Those factors could be incredibly personal, but the technology, not being able to sense anything other than emotion, analyzes this personal part of someone's life as much as it would do a bored kid in class. This is a blatant invasion of students' privacy and needs to be prevented from doing such.

D'Alto argues that the technology could provide substancial benefits to the classroom by creating personalized programs for each student to remain interested, but this process would just prove overall inneffective or exhorbitantly expensive to implement. To provide reason for this technology being implemented in classes, D'alto states in paragraph 6 that ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This has to be looked at in two different scenarious: a group class and a personalized class. For the group class, modifying the lesson would be overall inneffective because it would cause other students that used to be enjoying class to become bored and lethargic, thus prompting the computer to modify the lesson. The cycle would continue until the end of class, with the technology switching teaching methods so often that calling the class coherent would be blatant lying. This modification method would only work if each student had their own computer modifying the lesson. In that scenario, each student would be personally invested into what they were learning. However, it also means that each student would need their own computer that holds this technology. For technology that currently is too complicated for ordinary computers to comprehend, that would require schools to invest exhorbitant amounts of money purchasing new computers that could hold this software. For every student to have a computer would be way too expensive for any implementation to be cost-effective. Despite possible learning benefits, the technology would either be too expensive to be implemented or too innefective to be used.

It's an interesting concept to imagine a world where computers are able to sense emotions and create a personalized program for each person on Earth. However, this imagination is riddled with expenses, invasion of privacy, redundancy, and overall inneffectivity. As the technology age progresses, it's important to remember to leave teaching to the teachers.",6,7,0.8754267692565918

If a student is sad, a peer or tecaher can help them get through what they're going through. If a human can't read facial expressions that good, a computer can. Technology is a good source for reading students' emotions.

Technology could help an individual see what another individual is feeling. In the text it states that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" that's what the Facial Action Coding system is there for. If someone can't tell how their peer is feeling, they should use this technology. Computers are smart. Technology can tell how you're feeling. The Facial Action Coding System is a good way to communicate your emotions.

If a student is not in the best mood, a peer or a teacher can help them with what they're going through. ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face,"" humans can't tell what people are going through that wears a neutral face. The Facial Action Coding System reads all of your face muscles and movements. ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar add might follow,"" this tells the audience that computers can tell how you're feeling.

It is able to distinguish individual expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness which humans can find hard to do making it vital to being infused into the use of schools. Teachers would be able to learn more of their students and improve on their curriculums in order to satisfy the needs of their students. The FACS machine would be able to tell whether a student is lying, needs emotional support and help, and see whether they understand the lesson or not making the machine essential to school life.

When it comes to school, students will not always tell the truth. They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,"" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools.

This mechanism is able to determine the emotions of a student and see if they need help or not. It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school.

Students may not understand a lesson and are having troubles getting through it. SInce humans find the task of reading emotions diffficult, a teacher may not be able to see this and help the student out but this machine can deal with that problem too. How the machine deals with this horrible issue is state in the statement,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This quote shows how the FACS mechanism would be able to tell if a student is bored which would signal the teacher to modiffy the lesson in order for it to be better understood. Students would no longer have to complain about not understanding their homework or curriculum. This would allow for better grades and better lives for the students in the future.

In conclusion, the FACS machine would be essential to the lives of students in a classroom. Teachers would b able to make the experience of school even better than it is already and easier than it is already. No student would have to struggle anymore which is key to the success of a school as everyone would learn greatly and effecttively. The machine would deal with the problems of whether a student is telling the truth or not, whether a student is in need of emotional support or not, and whether a student needs help understanding the curriculum and lesson that they are learning.",6,7,0.7822127342224121

They started with a system called "" FACS"". FACS is known for ""facial action coding system"". The creator of FACS is Dr. Paul Eckman, Dr. Huang had many predictions based off video imagery

and how it would work.

The FACS system was created for sensing emotions from imagery. Eckman classified six emotons happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He then tried to associate them with facial muscles getting different facial expressions. Each facial expression tells how a person feeling, "" for example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when your're suprised"". This means that when your feeling a certain way your muscles react. So creating this code system helps them with trying to figure out how others are feeling in there facial expressions working torwards facial emotion expressions while in front of a computer.

Dr. Huang made a few predictions and conclusions based off the work of psychologists. One of the psychologists was Dr. Paul Eckman, Dr. Huang states that "" the facial expression for each emotion are universal"". He also states that ""

even though individuals often show

varying degrees of expression"". Meaning it happens all the time even though there are all types of forms of expressions. While using video imagery it can sense the facial movements in a still image or a real face.

We create these thoughts about others daily. you can tell whether a person is happy, sad, mad etc. the text states"" you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". They use "" Mona Lisa"" to show how these things work from a computer. Dr. Huang also predicts "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confuse or bored"".

it just might

improve others on doing there work. Yes it maybe be a hassle to get everything together but in do time everything will fall in place. Technology improves as the days go by , that technology will imact the world. Just

For instance, the invention identified da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" as being ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.""

The Facial Action Coding System could be utilized brilliantly to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, a valuable idea that could change the way a school is run.

First of all, teachers could use this tool to test how their students react to certain lessons, topics, and concepts.

By using the FACS to gauge the class, they could identify how to modify lesson plans for future units and for the years to come.

As Dr. Huang states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'""

The teacher could access and interpret these results, or the computer itself could ""modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

The emotional information of these students could provide valuable information and instruction that would in turn give a student more confidence and a better undeerstanding of the topic at hand.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System could be used to help pupils measure the effectiveness of not only lessons, but homework assignments as well.

From a student's perpective, homework is the dreaded and unforgiving punishment that one always has to look forward to when one gets home.

If the FACS was used to measure the reactions of kids to certain assignments, the new technology could modify these assignments to better fit the needs of each individual student.

The same topics would still be taught, but not every individual learns the same way, so by using this emotions-reading innovation each student could learn and develop better connections with their current subject material.

Lastly, there are some who might say that the FACS would be useless in helping the learning proccess of a child.

Naysayers could claim that this type of instruction would never work in a classroom because a computer can't provide the same type of personal connection that a teacher can develop with a student.

However, this is exactly what the purpose of the Facial Action Coding System should be; to personally instruct a student based on that child's specific learning needs.

The computer technology itself may not be able to directly teach a new topic, but it can certainly help the proccess by identifying what methods work and which ones do not in a classroom.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is an incredibly valuable tool.

This innovation can pave the way for the future of instruction, setting up a template for teaching for years to come.

Not only could the FACS be used to help teachers modify the way that they present their information in a classroom, the Facial Action Coding System could be used as an additional item to help students with their homework.

While some might say it's too impersonal to be effective, this new technology could truly be the most personal and individual type of instruction that the world has at its fingertips.

In the end, Dr. Huang said it best; ""'Most human connection is nonverbal, including emotional communication...so computers need to understand that, too.""   ",6,7,0.890600323677063
5ab2093,"Would it be awesome if you could read someone's emotion by the look on their face?, You could but most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can enable computers to identify human emotions. That means this can read emotions correctly. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can identify a person emotion by coding the facial structure is being planned to be used in classroom to read the emotional expression, In my opinion i considered it to be valuable.

First, Everyone is different and reveal different emotions. For example this technology can be used in classroom to read the emotions of students, teachers can identify when students are not paying attention or just bored. This technology will let the teachers know that maybe change plans some fun activities before moving to regain the students attention.

Second, Faces don't lie; If a student had been bullied the technology will show the emotion of that student which will alert the teachers, teachers can talk with the students about whats wrong? or what happend?. Many kids in the world are bullied but they keep their sadness and fear to themselves, even when they show sadness or fear teachers can't tell or understand. The FACS doesn't just take a picture of a face, it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model move like human muscles.

Third, This technology can have impacts everywhere not just at hospital, or video games. FACS can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Teachers can make animation and excites the students to regained attention. Teachers can do animation for the topic they are on to impress the students.

Last but not least, ""why not?"", If the FACS is affordable for schools to obtain, Why not right? It can be used for educational purposes. For example, students can use this for projects or other activites. Instead of schoolwork students can be involve with peers and read eachothers emotion. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, icluding emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang.

In conclusion, I considered this technology (FACS) to have a good impact in classroom, This technology can change the game for teachers and even students.  ",4,7,0.8433105945587158

People hide emotions and that is not okay, people need to know when their friends are mad, sad, depressed, happy, angry, etc. It helps those people know if they can for example, say a joke or not, talk about certain things, tell a story. What if we could spend our time and money into something else that is more important. This is a really cool peace of technology but is it really worth it.

Is this emotion expression reader really worth it in the grand scheme of things. It is very cool to find out how people are feeling in pictures or how your friends are feeling but do we actually need it. People could be spending money in other places. It is nice to know how people are feeling because someone could tell if they are just pretending or really smiling. This could also helps people find out if somone is depressed or not. If a kid is depressed and angry about something we could use this to find out if they are faking a smile or if they have been cured from their depression. The emotion expression reader has some value but is it really that great.

This machine that reads emotions can be valuable if used in the right ways. We can scan someones face to see if they are depressed or if they are cured and are actually happy, Yet there are other places we could spending money, we could spend it on technology that matters more, like vehicle technology, computer technology, improved cell phones. People can be careless with there money and spend it on all the wrong things. It is cool to find out how someone is feeling just by one simple scan, we can know if someone is sad, happy, angry, surprised, disgusted, or fearful.

5ace3fa,"Facial action coding system is a great way for teachers to understand how a student is truly feeling about an assignment or lesson in class. Facial action coding systems can help teachers to know if a student needs to either move ahead for a lesson or slow down. This software will help a student further comprehend the work their being assaigned instead of giving up early on. Not every human expresses their emotions the same way on their face so the coding system would have to be advanced and be able to detect slight emotions for every face.

The Facial action coding system does not always work the same for everyones face. A student can be deceptive and it may seem on their face that they are attentative and happy about the work, but could just be thinking about what their going to have for lunch. The pros for the facial action coding sytem are that the system would be able to detect when a student is completely furious and confused about the work they are doing. Another senario for the facial recoginition system would also be able to detect if a student is really confused about the work but they have all the right answers. This system would certainly prevent cheating from students and promote more honest work.

In this article ¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨, the facial recognition system detects that Mona Lisa is feeling 83 percent happy, but is she really feeling this way? Emotion can not always be detected through facial recognition. Humans can have serious mood swings and can be deceptive and indecisive with their emotions. One moment a teenager could be 95 percent happy, but with mood swings varying the next moment that same student could be 65 percent frustarted. Facial action coding system is a great idea to implicate into schools if, the sytem does not have any flaws with detecting faces.   ",3,7,0.855166494846344

Being abble to hide emotions from onthers is not that hard, you van put on a smile and act happy around others and be different be yourself happenes all the time with teens and young adults. Will the machine be able to detect that? Or will it show the outer emotions rather than inner.

This may help a lot of schools witth kids who dont like sharing their feelings, but at what cost will it take fot them to make kids go out and do this? Will it be something thats mandatory or will it be a choice? Thats the question we need to be asking, will it help teens and kids overcome feelings they dont like sharing or will it hurt them even more knowing they felt something that they have been denying all along. Also how do we know if thats correct? In the article it only used an example thats not even a person who is breathing, they used a painting so why spend an upwards of 5,000 dollars on something that may or may not work depending on the situation.

Students get told all the time by teachers, parents, and a lot of other people that expressing their feelings is very important and to do it to someone they trust. Will this take that away the connection between two people sharing feelings, will we turn intoa society that relies on a machine to tell us our emotions? In mu opinion schools shouldnt make or even give this option to students it is giving them an ""escape"" to talking about their feelings, will it be worth it in the end? To turn our next generation that its okay not to tell how we feel. isnt that the same as being sort of ""robotic"". My parents stress the improtance of showing and talking about emotions and how it makes people closer, now they want to trow that away for a machine. I also see it being sort of like an alternative counsilier because you go see your counsilier about how your feeling and isnt that technically what this machine is doing?

We need to stick with human interactions, having that is what makes us a society of poeple who care about one another.

Now this new technology called FACS (Facial Acting Coding System) can measure human emotions. It also measures Mona Lisa's emotion. Is it valuable in today's world.

Nowdays, unlimited machines have been built to comfort human civilization. Some of them really benefitted, some of not. Now a Human emotion telling machine is built to measure emotions. I think it is valuable because the creator might have built it for purpose. But what I personally think, ""IT IS USELESS"". WHY?.Let me explain you.

Humans are making new machines. But who has the time to test it. Because machines are growing, but the civilization is busy. Some people can't give their family some time because they got job to do. If they're done with job, then they have to look for home. Stress increases these days.

I think this machine is valuable same as useless. Valuable because it takes a lot of time and years to make. Useless because it has no role to deal with human stress, it reads emotions, that's pretty cool. But what anout dealing with stress. I hope you like my thought.   ",1,7,0.5768333077430725
5b3b31a,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System used to read the emotion and expressions in students in a classroom is valuable because it can be used for many different things such as potentionaly making people feel better, helps tell when people are not being truthful and can tell when a student becomes confused of bored.

First of all, this technology to read the emotions and expressions of a students in a classroom is valuable because, even know sometimes you fake emotions it many still be able to make you feel that way. For example the author stated in paragraph 9 that "" Theory Of Emotion, moving you facial muscles not only expresses emotion, but may be able to produce them."" What this is saying is that the muscles that you use in your face to fake an emotion can actually make you feel that emotion.

Secoundly, this technolgy could also help and be valuable not just in a classroom but also outside such as the police department. The reason why is because your facial expressions can make other people tell if you are not being truthful and not telling the truth. The author states this in paragragh 8 saying "" To an expert, faces don't lie: these muscle clues are somtimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" polaticion or celebrity isn't being truthful."" What this is saying is this new technology could help tell when someone is lying about cheating on a test or homework. And this doesnt just go for inside school or classrooms this could go for the police to. To tell if someone isnt being truthful about something and which part they arent being truthful about.

Finally, the last thing I have to support for this is could help teacher relize when a student is confused or bored in a classroom. How the author explains this is in paragragh 6. It states that "" A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" What this means is that how the students facial expressions react to what pops up on the computer can show when the student is interested in what is happening or confuse, and bored. And the author also stated ""Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgerys"". What this is saying is a computer can tell when you are bored or confused and help to keep you fouced and intertained more by making the lesson more expressive and also making it more interesting for the student.

In conclusion, I believe what I have stated above proves that this technolgy can help in many ways such as potentionaly making people feel better, helps tell when people are not being truthful and can tell when a student becomes confused of bored. And that this will help many students and teachers in a classroom.",4,7,0.8484466075897217
5b4da4a,"Using new technology to ""calculate"" peoples emotions will be a new and very advanced way to comunicate wiht others. For example, someone could just scan a person's face and tell if they're worth talking to or not. Also , some people may not want to be scaned and get told their emotions. The only people that should get this kind of technology is either , police , therapists or, people who willreally use them to study people.

Most people will not wants to be scanned by this new type of technology because , will probably not know what its used for. For example, the person may be scanned without their consent or the person can be a lot older and could make a big deal about it. Also, someone may not approve of this software being used by anyone because it will be to advanced or not good enough. The FACS software is going to be the new way to read a persons facial expressions.

FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can ""constuct a 3-D computer model of the face and read all 44 major muscles. Movement by one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"", this new type of software cannot be used by a normal home PC becuase of it complex algorithims. ",2,7,0.7459163665771484
5b81dcf,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is described by the author of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"". This system enables computers to identify six of the human emotions. This technology should be used to read the emotional expresiions of students in a classroom, because it is a very valuable technology.

Firstly, we should have this technology because it would help explain how people would be feeling on a certain subject, lifestyle or in everyday life. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" Since Dr. Eckman has programmed these emotions we can better understand how someone is feeling without having to ask him; each emotion inflicts a facial muscle movement which is recognised and is catagorized as an emotion.

In addiotion, we should have these identifiers because it could help students learn better. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This software could help someone who is easily distracted. This technology could find a way to help with this person, and the coding system could produce a lesson that this person can listen to and understand it because it was made for them.

Also, the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers and staff. Some students do not show what they are feeling. If this technology can figure out facial expressions then the teachers will know who is having a bad day, the teacher could then talk to this person privately and see how they are doing. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotuions, but also may even help produce them."" Since studies show that if a student smiles they could have a better day. The teacher could recognise that someone is feeeling down so they could say a funny joke and sprout an emotion into a particualr student.

In the final analysis, we should have the Facial Action Coding System in school because it will help students feel better and learn better. If a student does not want to go to school then they probably do not want to learn either. If this system can make someone's day then students would want to come to school, and teachers would then have students who want to learn. ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is a great article and the technology that is included in the article may be the next big thing. The first step for the coding system is to use the technology to read the emotional expression of student in classrooms. This technology can help a student throughout their school work. It can also help the teachers to teach more passionatly to students who want to learn and are not forced to come to school, but come voluntarily.",5,7,0.9149544835090637

Whoever woud have known that technology would get so advanced that even computers can read our emotions. Yeah that's right, a new software called Facial Action Coding System is able to detect our emotions by creating a 3D model of our face and recording our 44 muscle movements. This type of software should be allowed in schools to help teachers identify students who struggle in their classes.

The Facial Action Coding System has promising results and was able to detect Mono Lisa's emotions, ""She's 83 perecent happy, 9 perecent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto 1). This was a test conducted by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe. These are two professers that develop better ways for human and computers to comminicate. With the help of these professors the software FACS can detect ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" (D'Alto 3). In other words it can detect emotions and that could be very useful in classrooms.

Another point why I believe this software is valuale in a classroom is because in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang said "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto 6). This is a very helpful tool because students are very shy, scared, and nervous when it comes to speaking up or asking questions, Dr. Haung pointed out that ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communucation"" (D'Alto 6). What is being said is that people do not comminicate verbaly or emotionaly and they want computers to know that. With FACS software's in classrooms it can help identefy and improve students education.

Last but not least in paragraph 8 it was said that ""faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"" (D'Alto 8). What this is saying is that their facial recognition software never fails to detect when someone is lying and that faces do not lie. This could be used to identify if a student is being honest or is lying about what they have done.

In conclusion there are many benifits allowing Facial Action Coding System in classrooms. This software can detect students emotions, when teachers can not. FACS can also notice when someone is not being honest and this could be used to test students to see if they are trustworthy or not. I see nothing but positive outcomes of this software and I look forward to seeing this in future classrooms. ",4,7,0.9051859974861145

Children tend to not want to say much or tell the teachers how they really feel about a homework assignment or how boring their class really is. With the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System teachers and administrators can view how the students really feel about the way things are devised. This technology can perceive and recognize the subtle facial movements of humans based off a still image of the person. The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to read students' emotional expresions in the classroom and help schools become more sufficient.

In the article the author says ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" Some type of software is seeing what one takes interest in and making it a priority to stay consistent. School could be the same way. If the Facial Action Coding System sees that during a specific activity or certain topic students are engaged and very pleased with the task, it could help the school follow up with those types of tasks more often. The author quotes Dr. Hang by saying ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" What Dr. Hang is initially saying is, if the computers have the asset of detecting if students are confused or having trouble the new technology could transfer that to teachers. He also says "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human intstructor."" Sometimes students have trouble asking the teacher for assistance. Or some things just may be too hard for them, but they will never say anything. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, lessons can change to where as it approaches each student differently. This could possibly provide a boost to essential test scores for a school. However, not to say that the software could potentially read the emotions of others wrong, because in some cases humans tend to have a look on their face that contradicts their actual emotion. Not to mention the software is compared against a neutral face. That means that the software is going off of a blank expression extracting a emotion from it. But, that's what makes the Facial Action Coding System so unique and valuable because students often have blank expressions protrayed on their face anyhow.

All in all, the Facial Action Coding System could be a great value to assist instructors in reading students emotions in the classroom. Not only could it give a stepping stone to major test scores, but it could assist school becoming students best interest.                    ",4,7,0.852829098701477

5c2e1c3,"Facial Action Coding System is a system in a computer that takes human faces and tells the emotions of that person, made from Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all forty four major muscels in the nodel must move like human muscels. They tested this system on the Mona Lisa painting who was created by artist Leonardo da Vinci. The system shows that the Mona Lisa is eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. However, they are trying to use this technology to read students' emotional expressions, which I am strongly against for the fowling reasons.

Students should have the right to tell rather how they feel or not. As a student in high school, facial expressions are key to what kids are thinking. If students do not want to say what that student feels they should be able to keep it to themselves. All students should have the right to defend themselves with their thoughts. The movement towards that technology to get students emotional expressions will start making a fight between students.

To add to, this system is a very expensive system where schools do not have the money for. Schools need to focus more on getting more help for their students, not finding out their emotional expressions. However, having this system can help students who are in need of guidance, but the students would rather talk to a counslor than a computer. Schools should put more of that money into new books or new activites for the students so the students can say well educated and socially active.

To sum it up, the Facial Action Coding Sytem is a system in which a computer reads a humans face. They should not use this on studenets for privacy of the student, and financial issues. This is a brlliant idea towards pictures of people as in the Mona Lisa, not in students. Students have the right to go to a guidance counsler for issues if they have any, but a student should not get he or she face read unless of student conncent.               ",4,7,0.902519941329956
5c39595,"Imagine what it would be like to use technology to identify human emotions? The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" informs us of a new method that might be beneficial for teachers. Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has used improved technology to help establish a connection between computers and how they are able to detect human emotions. Another man, by the name of Prof. Thomas Huang, has developed a software, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Using computers to help read the emotional expressions of students could be very valuable for teaching and improving education all around the world.

Before learning about the benifits of how computers can detect emotions, it's significant to grasp how the system works. The process begins when a computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All forty-four major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Moreover, each of the emotions, he claims, are associated with characteristic movements of facial muscles.

On the other hand, Dr. Huang claims that computers can even detect emotional communication when it is nonverbal. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" His claim seems appealing because it's important for teachers to help their students succeed. However, students periodically become unfocused, confused, and tired throughout the school day. Thats where advanced computers come into play.

Overall, it would be in the best interest of teachers and community schools to upgrage to advanced methods of teaching, involving computers that detect human emotions. Not only would it be beneficial to students, but it would also improve the knowledge of generations and generations. The general public would be brilliant and could do incredible things. They would be able to cure what are now considered uncurable diseases, improve the standard of living, and find answers to environmental problems such as global warming. ",2,7,0.9090608358383179
5cdd3f5,"The idea of being able to calculate someone's exact emotions based on simply looking at their face seems almost impossible, but doctors seem to be proving that wrong. People may ask themselves, how can you know what can be going on in someone's brain when you cannot see through their head? Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts in figuring out new ways for humans and computers to communicate. In fact, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe have recently innovated a new computer software. This new fantastic innovation can potentially solve problems and help many people.

This new software has been used on Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting, the Mona Lisa, and there has been actual results that produce accurate persentages.This type of computer software could be installed everywhere, from your work, to your home, and even to you school. Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" I believe that this new invention could be very helpful to teachers and principals in all schools. For instance, if a student is too shy to ask questions about a lesson they do not understand, the software could pick up confusion from the kid's face and notify the teacher.

Dr. Huang also says, ""Then it could motify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Not only does the new software detect emotions, but can make modifications towards a lecture as well. This innovation has the porential to do the tasks of a human being and beyond. Now a days, adults do not seem to understand what a child or teenager goes through, but the invention can help those adults assist a person in academic and emotional needs.

As for learning, the software can help excell and challenge students in a new way. This could teach students many new things related to anatomy, psychology, and even art. It would bring so much new information to the table and further technology even more. This could even open up a new field of work for those students interested in the innovation.

In conclusion, a new invention like this would do wonders for the human population. Everyone would get a better understanding of what they feel and what others feel as well. There is nothing better than getting a chance to learn more about yourself. This new software could change the way we look at others, ourselves, and even the world.        ",4,7,0.7943733334541321
5cf885b,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotions of students in a class room is valuable. The Facial Action Coding System uses science and math to predict what emotion you are experincing. This means, that one, if a student is acting up in class or falling behind you can figure issue that student is having by using this sowftware, acting up or falling behind could be an emotional issue, and two knowing what your students are feeling may help you better teach them.

Most students do not tell teachers why they act up or why they are falling behind. Most teachers always try to help their student, but they cannot help without knowing whats wrong. The Fatial Action Coding System allows teachers to know what students are feeling during their time of need, and it also could better enable a teacher to help them over come their problems. This technology calculates ""six basic emotions, happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" these emotions are always expressed when a student is falling behind, upset, or mis behaving. If a teacher better understands the emotion a student is feeling it could help that teacher help that student overcome what is happening in their life.

Knowing what a student is feeling when a new lesson is taught could better help a teacher teach the lesson it could also even improve a class no one likes. Most students love some classes or hate some classes, but there is almost never an inbetween. If the classes students hate could get tested on with what emotion each indevidual is feeling while taking that class, could better help make the class better. Using the Facial Action Coding System you can get acurate readings for why students dislike a class emotion wise becuase the software precisly computes a ""3-D computer model"" of your face including all ""44 major muscles"" that tell your emotion.

In conclusion I belive that the technology is valuable to classrooms. It could better help how students act in a class and it could help the teacher teach the class in a way that students like and love it. This technology could revolutionize a classroom experince, teachers will finally know the ""why"" behind why you like a class. It is all based on emotion and knowing someones emotions could help solve so many everyday problems teachers have with students.       ",4,7,0.8079087138175964
5d23658,"The Facial Action Coding System is a system that will construct a 3-D computer model of the face and use muscle movements to figure out what you are communicating emotionally. With that being said, will this information given by the system be valuable in a classroom? Here are my reasons why I believe it would be valuable to both the students and teacher in the classroom.

In a classroom, you have a wide range of personalities. Students may feel shy or uncomfortable asking questions. If a teacher asks how well the class is dealing with the subject, a student may say they are dealing well with the subject when they really are not. Dr. Huang says is,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that, too."" A teacher in a classroom can understand verbal communication but maybe only slight emotional communication. Having a Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in your computer can help it to understand the majority of what a student may really be feeling about the subject.

A lot of times today classrooms are packed with students, also giving a wide range of abilities. This range of ability doesn't allow teachers time to help the struggling students. In paragraph six Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If we had this technology, it could help students to keep up with the rest of their class by changing how the lesson is taught depending on the individual.

This technology would have the capability to figure out more easily the emotions of a student and be able to relay that back to the teacher. A teacher may think that a class is enjoying the subject based on what they say or what they act like, when in actual fact this may not be the case. According to the text, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This technology can understand if students are not relating well with the style of teaching that is available and then make this information available to the teacher. The teacher can then look at what the students really feel like in their class, and then adapt the style or structure of class to facilitate more engagement and interaction from the students.

Therefore I believe that the use of this new technology would be valuable. FACS would be able to help struggling students do better than they are in their subjects by changing the lesson depending on their emotions. It would be able to modify the lesson for a student so that they may more easily understand. It would be able to help teachers to understand how their students feel in the classroom and so they can more easily facilitate the students different learning styles. This system would help the whole classroom function more effectively.",4,7,0.8629869222640991
5d31922,"Is Facial Action Coding System, a program desgined to accurately predict a persons emotions from their face, valuable to use on students?

Being able to know what students are feeling could be important. A computer that is able to actively track your emotions and edit the lessons accordingly is a good thing. This technology is the next step in helping students learn and understand more, and become better at skills they once struggled with.

Students that struggle often don't speak up during class, and consequetly suffer on test and homework that follows. If a computer can identify a confused student and reteach the subject or concept, it can make a world of difference. Many students who doesn't learn a concept early in school and never learn it will struggle later on. The principle of learning is that a student is taught one level at time, each time building off of the previous level. The basic principles of level one are often reapplied in a more complex form in the next level or levels. If a student never understands the first concept they will fail at understanding the more complex versions of it. If this can be identified from level one, the student can be very much more successful and happy later on.

Facial Action Coding System is a brilliant solution to helping out students and improving the learning enviroment. If introduced to schools it can raise standarized test scores, improve the emotional enviroment. This technology will allow students to lead more successful and happy lives.

5d33f39,"Technology is often pushed furiously in society today,especially when it

concerns students in the classroom. When it comes down to Dr. Huang's innovation, FACS (Facial Action Coding System) which is shown and detailed in Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" , which shows in the article FACS has been shown to have the power to determine one's facial expressions and determine their mood. People are left in awe of the creation and many would like to see the extent of its power, which leaves people wondering whether FACS should be used in the classroom or not. Although the use of FACS in classrooms might be difficult to implement in classrooms at first, it would be a great boon to have use of such technology in class, due to the advantages provided.

If FACS were to be used in classrooms, the applications and advantages provided would be numerous. One of the examples that was given in the article by Dr. Huang, was how facs could be used to alter the speed of a curiculum and provide feedback

from the students by analyzing their emotions and expressions, by doing this the machine is able to determine whether the student or students are interested in the subject, or if they are confused or not. The data then provided adjustments could be made to the lesson to better fit the students education and help them learn

better, as you can see from the statement Dr. Huang says,

"" ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""

Dr. Huang Predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human intstructor."" . . . ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" "".

From what the text shows, you can see the power of the FACS being able to determine and effectivily teach students based off facial expressions which give insight into whether a student understands the lesson being taught or if the student just does not understand the material nor care as a result of being bored. The use of the facial recognition software would speed up the process of student's educations and would be more effective since it was specifically engineered for the purpose of analyzing patterns in human faces, versus using one instructor to relying on verbal feedback to properly understand the needs of his or her students. If the FACS were to be used it would help students who need help due to the facs being able to read students emotions which are valuable since it affects their attituted towards learning and as a result of their skill. Students who feel confused, angered, nonchalant, or fearful of a subject are less likely to be able to suceed in that subject, by removing and helping qualm those emotions the FACS is able to sucessfully impact the qualtiy of said students educations.

All in all, by using FACS to analyze the emotions of students and their facial expressions, the instructor of the software it's self can make adjustments to better fit the students mind and ease the negative emotions that directly impact student's ability to learn. With the corelations between emotions and ability to learn, it is a no brainer that having technology analyze emotions of the students to better augment the lesson to their needs.

5d3b183,"The use of Facial Action Coding System is useful and valuable to read the emotional expressions of students because it will benefit and help teachers in classrooms understand what the student is truly feeling and what is going on in their mind.

This technology system will be ""able to detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" Many students in class have anxiety of speaking infront of many people, fear of being wrong, and not asking questions when they don't know what is going on. They will know when and how to help students through the help of the system.

Another reason why Facial Action Coding System will improve classroom environments and the learning skills of all the students is the system will let teachers know when the student is angry because when the ""orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens you lips to show anger.""(3)

If a student is angry, the system will detect it and the teachers will know as well. Anger can indicate many things in a student. Something may not be okay at home or in their family. The student may have too much going on in their life. When this happens, students tend to hide their emotions and not ask for help, when in reality they do. The system would automatically give intail on the emotion to the teacher so they can offer help, guidance and support to the student and let them know that a teacher is there for them.

Students would not learn anything if they are too distracted or too tired. If there is a technology to read students' emotional expressions, it would benefit teachers because the system will notice the emotions they might be feeling like ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and saddness..."" (3). If the teacher knows what the students true feelings are, for example boredom, This Facial Action Coding System would help teachers know ""...when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(6)

It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.

Secondly, The facial expressin for each emotion are universal. Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions.

Finally, Dr. Huang observes that artist such as da Vinci studied human anatomy help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

Using the technology to read emotions could be beneficial in the classroom. It could tell when a student is sad and needs help, or angry and needs to be stopped before something bad happens. Either way use possible use for this technology are endless.

The techology would be useful in the classoom, epecailly in high school where all sorts of emotions are runnung wild. "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear,

and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles"". ( paragraph 3 Nick D'Alto). Eckman's technology uses 3-D modles of the human face and can calculate which expression it has by using the facial muscle groups. Each different emotions uses a different muslce in the face, so the computer would be able to see which emotion is paired with what mucle group. This would be extremly beneficial in school, because schools are now becoming more advanced with each student having their own personal laptop. The software could be pre-insatlled on the computer before being handed out, and moniter the students emotion when using it.

The technology of being able to read emotions could also help a student when learning. Now that schools are becoming more personal, some teachers are even doing their classes online. "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" ( paragraph 6). The internet changes to you emotion, and according to Dr. Huang schooling will to. The face reading software could detect when a student is bored or confused, then the lesson could be modified. Changing the lesson when the student is confused or bored could really help the student pass the class. When people are bored or confused, nothing sticks they just forget, so the purpose of reading emotions could be very benefical in school.

As humans, we already have the ability to tell what emotion a person is feeling just by looking at their face. But as humans, we also have the ability to lie about our emotions, and sometimes, we are fooled by false emotions. However, Eckman's program can detect and read through forced emotions. Forced emotions uses differerent muscles than the natural emotons. "" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". ( paragraph 8) At school, this technolgy could be used to read past a persons fake smile, and determine wheather the student needs help and support. When we smile naturally we use the Zygomatic Major that lift the corners of our mouth, and the Obicularis Oculi ake the crows feet in our eye brows. When we do a force smile, we still use the Zygomatic major but the mouth is stretched sideways and we use another muscle, the Risorius. In a time where all sorts of drama occur, false emotoins are sure to sprout up. So the ability to read emotions would be viable in school.

Technology has always helped us from time to time. We use technology to get around places, manufacturing goods or escaping danger. But the technology to read human emtion truly is something special, and this technology would be valaubale to the classroom.   ",4,7,0.8238581418991089

The use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a class room. it can recognize emotions, it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and lastly, it can create emotional communication.

First, the system can recognize emotions. It is not always possible for teachers to make correct assumptions on how the students are feeling. For instance, if someone finds out about how a student is feeling, he/she will have ""Some trouble describing each facial trait that conveys, happy, worried."" With the use of the facial action code in a classroom, a teacher can precisely tell how a students is feeling. According to Dr. Huang, "" The software is the latest innovation from prof. He relied on work from psychologists like Dr. Paul Eckman to classiy the six basic emotions."" This totally means that Dr. Huang was able to co-operate with some psychologists to precisely identify the different basic emotions. Sometimes students often show some various degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements."" In this case, we can conclude that the new technology can precisely identify a student emotion. For this reason, the use of a Facial Action Coding System should be allowed in a classroom.

Secondly, this new technology can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored in class. Teachers can't always tell if a student is getting confused or bored in class. For instance, not all students in class like to speak up when they are getting confused or bored. With the use of Facial Action Coding System, a teacher can clearly see if a student is getting confused or bored. According to the article, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" After recognizing, ""It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" In this case, we can see that the Facial Coding System can recognize when a student is getting bored in class. For this reason, the use of Facial System is valuable because teachers can not always recognize when a student is getting bored in class.

Lastly, the Facial Coding System can create emotional communication. It is not always possible for your friends, teachers or a family member to know how you are feeling. Your friends might sometimes be able to tell due to how you look, but they can't deeply tell what's the problem with you. According to the article ""Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Computers need to understand that too."" It also says in the article that the system can even indicate ""The diference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" These systems can also comuunicate by describing the type of smile you have on your face. For instance, in a false smile, ""The mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and different muscle."" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, ""Moving your facila muscles not only expresses, emotions, but also may even help produce them."" In this case, we can conclude that these systems are valuable and beneficial in classrooms. For this reason, the use of a Facial Coding System is valuable in a classroom.

In conclusion, the use of a Facial Action Coding System is beneficial in a classroom. The system can recognize emotions, it can tell if a student is getting confused or bored in class, and lastly. the system can create emotional communication. With this invention, a teacher does not always need to ask a student about how they are feeling; he/she can precisely tell by looking into the the Facial System. ",5,7,0.8848259449005127

You can do that with FACS (Facial Action Coding System), created by Dr. Pail Eckman. This system classifys 6 basic emotions. It can sense happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is good for teacher who dont understand how their student are feeling about the assignment they assigned.

Dr. Huang, says in paragraph four, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" He says, "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" Using video imagery, the emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements on a real face or even a picture. The author uses an example of the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci. They used the emotion-recongnition on the painting and it showed how Mona Lisa was feeling. It not only looks at how your smiling or how your eye are placed, it also looks at the structure of ur face and how your muscles move.

This creation can help lots of teacher all around the world understand and help students learn more efficently. Every single student learns differently and using this system will help teacher use their teaching time wisely. When student dont understand somthing this system can scan your face and tell the teacher what needs to be fixed to help the student understand and enjoy what they are learning.

Instead of teachers trying to help one student at a time they can help multiple students at once.

You can also use FACS not only in school but other places too. You can use it in work and also in everyday life if you wanted too. In paragrah nine the author talks about a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky. He had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Just making different faces can revel a lot about the science of emotion.

5e5dab1,"The smile of the Mona Lisa has

eluded people for centuries. The slightly smug look suggests an

emotion that not many people can detect. Luckily, there appears to be a software that can detect one's emotion based off of the facial movements one makes.The software was developed by Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute, and there could be so many uses that this technology could be applied to. One such example is the classroom, where teachers will know when a student is becoming confused or bored. However, one must ask the questions that this technology brings. In essence, this software is not useful, applicable or effective inside of the classroom because of the cost of the software, the intrusion of privacy, and a host of other problems. Computing technology could have the ability to be useful inside of the classrom, just not this kind.

The first point that would make teachers unsure is the cost of the software. In the article, there is no mention of the cost of the newly developed software. There are numbers, indeed, but they are simply percentages or single numbers. Based on what the article said, one could assume that the cost of this technology would be high. This would not be a very effective tool for an average American school, but the tech could be applied to richer schools or universities.

Secondly, the software is an intrusion of privacy in the school. Although most public schools are indeed public places where civilians expose themselves, it also has a private element to it. Think of it as a small shard of individuality and alone time, like when one is at lunch. The software, if mounted on a camera or a tripod, would be able to observe every single student and every emotion in the room. Schools do need safety, indeed , but the use of this technology in an academic situation just seems proposterous. An alternative use would be to use this technology in hospitals, where nurses could percieve the emotion of patients, and whether they are in pain or not.

Although the technology developed by Dr. Huang and his colleagues is certainly impressive, the use of it in a school enviroment seems odd and misinformed. Schools are still meant to be relatively private places where people can feel safe and secure. The costs of this technology is unknown, but it is likely that it is not cheap. Artificial intelligence is meant to be used as efficiently as possible, and although scientists do have free reign on what they use this software for, applying it in schools is not the best way to make use of it.",4,7,0.8032457828521729
5e6063a,"The use of the new technology, the Facial Action Coding System, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is not valuable. It should be used exclusively for educational purposes and to help students gain knowledge on their studies in school.

This new computer software that can detect emotions should not be used on students, but on other material. Although I do not believe this is a valuable system to use on people, I believe it is valuable for people to use for educational purposes. For example, if students are examining a piece of artwork in art class and need to examine, or would like to determine, the true expression of a person's face in the artwork, this system could be used for that. If students wanted to go more in-depth and figure out specific percentages for each of the person in the painting's expressions, they could also use this system. The text reads, ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This was figured out by using the Facial Action Coding System on the painting of Mona Lisa, which determined careful, specific percentages of each of her emotions shown in her portrait, all within her neutral facial expression. I believe this system should be used in the classroom, exclusively for students' education and for examining certain material, such as artwork.

I believe there are better, more educational uses for the Facial Action Coding System than to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. This system could be used for students interested in, or participating in, a technology class. The text reads, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsin a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" The video imagery would be incredibly valuable to a student working with technology as a way to capture careful movements and detect emotions of artwork or another educational source. The text also reads, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" I believe students, especially ones working with technology, should be able to use this system, as it would be a valuable tool to use if they were to examine or study this process. It is important that this system is used correctly; to help students with their education and expand their knowledge on subjects in school, such as technology.

I do not believe the use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for detecting students' emotional expressions. It has better uses, such as for close examinations of artwork, research, and statistics. I feel as if students do not need a system to ""de-code"" our emotions, as students are typically able to fully express theirs on their own. Although it may be difficult to detect certain emotions of a student and encourage them to fully express them, I feel it is necessary to keep it that way, in respect for the student. The text reads, ""classified six basic emotionshappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" which I firmly believe is not useful, nor valuable. Typically, those six basic emotions are easiIy detected by humans and do not require a computer system. I do not believe a computer software system should determine students' emotions, let alone any humans', unless they would personally like to use it. I think of the Facial Action Coding System as more or a toy, if it is used to detect human's expressions rather than an educational material's expressions, such as a piece of artwork.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

Its the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotion."" The software can help teachers actually help students with mental health instead of writing them a slip and just saying you are fine. Also teachers can tell you how to coop with certain stresses bust by scaning you with a computer program.

It is able to distinguish the emotions of happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness.

During a class, a teacher might only be able to detect the current emotion a student feels when they study a student's facial expression.

Above all else, what if the student is acting to be happy just so other's won't worry about him or her?

This software is able to trace each emotion almost exactly to where teachers can keep up with their student's emotional state.

For example, if a student had an occurence they considered rather alarming, their teachers would be able to understand more about what's causing them to act differently in class.

The ability of this new technology would be able to ensure that all students are able to perform in their school without feeling overwhelmed by activities and personal issues outside of class.

Students who are facing emotional dilemas could be able to work more calmly once their own teacher is aware of their student's true feelings.

Meanwhile, there are students who face issues being able to focus in class.

In most morning classes, students may have the chance of not having had enough sleep, overslept, or not even having breakfast in the morning hours.

Then, their first lesson of the school day arrives and their mind isn't paying attention to what they are expected to learn.

In addition, the lesson being presented by their teacher may be confusing or completely uninteresting.

The article states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" (Nick D'Alto, 6).

This clearly shows that the technology by Professor Huang is able to even detect the student's troubled emotion while being a learning environment.

Also, With the assistance of this promising software, teachers benefit from this in two ways.

The first advantage would be seeing their students excel because of an improved lesson.

The second then ensuring that students are interacting and feeling that they are understanding what their teacher is instructing them to learn.

Its an overall victory for both students and teachers.

The matter of mixed emotions is sometimes a much more difficult thing to see.

People are all different and others when they see something for the first time, they'll believe when they see others saying what they've seen. Then, there are others who think that the recognition of mixed emotions is pure confusion.

To add on to that, the Facial Action Coding System isn't like that at all.

Within the article, it states, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (not smiling as broadly)"" and "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements,"" (Nick D'Alto, 4).

What people must take away from this critical reveal is this technology is prospering to bring others to see what they couldn't see before.

The identification of mixed emotions by the use of video imagery.

Also, as well as the comparision against a neutral face or a face that shows no emotion, which is later stated on.

The value of this technology is beyond the imaginations of today's society.

It would be able to bring new discoveries of emotions in of the daily lives of people.

The collection of emotions would bring people together to understand one another better. Better yet, this software can connect relatives because they are now aware of the other person's overall emotional state.

The realization of a person's emotions is something that is not normal, its completely extraordinary.

Professor Huang's technology is in the path to changing lives of people.

In the situation of politics, not a single person from the democratic or republican side can come to agreement. You may ask, ""Why?"", but the solution to this conflict is quite clear.

People can't come to fully understand one another.

Without a person coming to a basic understanding of someone else's emotions, neither one will ever come to agree with each other.

If ""team work makes the dream work"" then allow each side to see the emotions of other people; with the assitance of the Facial Coding System, that'll occur within no time at all because of its incredible reading of an human's expressive actions.           ",3,7,0.8589879274368286

This technology could read your emotions by just looking at your face. With this technology we could tell how some of the students are feeling. Some students could get confused or bored with the lesson and this could change that.

In the text it states that the a classroom computer could recognize if the student is becoming confued or bored, then the software would modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. While the software changes the lesson it could change the student's emotion and make them want to continue learning. It could make the lesson more interesting to learn and would help out students with better grades and test scores.

The Facial Action Coding System could also benefit the teachers because they do a lot of work like preparing the lesson and grading things, so the lesson they create could be uninteresting or confusing. With the software the lesson could be more clear and interesting for the students to learn and the teacher wouldn't be so stressed with so much work. The text also states, humans could calculate how people are feeling just by looking at their facial expression, but some people hide their emotions. The software could get how students are feeling even better and someone like the teacher could help out their problems.

This is why The Facial Action Coding System should be used in the classroom because it could help both students and the teacher. It is an innovative technology that could help us in many ways.",3,7,0.8815184831619263

express and describe how they feel, and it is because the muscular actions units. You can tell when someone is happy or if someone is angry, when you are happy your body make your lips raise at the corners of your mouth but when you are angry your muscles around your mouth tightens, but why is important to know about humans emotions?

There is a new software

called "" The Facial Action Coding System"" and this software makes easy to understand the emotions of others, and this is all becuase of the innovation from Prof.Thomas HUang and Prof.Nicu Sebe, they have a goal to make humans and computers to communicate in a better way.

The procces starts with a computer that models in 3-D the muscles of

the face, they use only the 44 major muscles, and in the six classfied emotions something different happens, it can also be called "" actio units"" and it is when there is one or more movements in your face. "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" - Dr.huang, and by this he means that even though everyone is different, we all do almost the same emotions when we are surprise or when we are mad, and in some of them are easier to recognize and in

some others in not that easy, you can tell how is your sister feeling just by looking at her face or if you want to ask for a favor the first thing you do is to look at their face, becuase if they show a emtion of being angry is better to ask another time, but in some others cases you can not tell how is that person feeling just by looking at her face, because some people express their emotions more than others and for this kinf od people the new software is really helpfull, everyday, we look at other persons emtions every day and maybe sometimes we don't even realize it, in some cases another persons emotions can change yours for example is you are really tired or sad and you see one person that it is super happy it can change your mood to a happy one.

I think that is it really smart to use the techonology for something good and this is one of them by reading students emotional expresions, it can help teachers to be better by knowing which type of lessons are confuse or bored and like this teachers can change it or make it better for students,sometimes some students are afraid to speak or say somethn infront of the class, when they have a question or they just do not understand, but with this software teachers can improve and by this students can also improve, "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" notes from Drr. Huang, so even if we try to figure out the emotions of someone we can't some of them keep them really well inside, this software makes it easy, i think they should use it in every school to help students that have to stay after school of pay tons of money for tutoring because maybe is it not that they do not understand, is it that the way some students learn in different, they do not learn the same ways, but with this kind of information the teachers can make it easier for everyone.",3,7,0.8144607543945312

The author claims this could be very useful in teaching, for being able to acount for the student's emotions could very well help the computer adapt and change the lesson more efficiently. While this could be true, there are a lot of questions that should be asked before this technology can be implemented, such as it's effectiveness and privacy.

The sixth paragraph says how the computer can know if you're happy or sad, and gives an example ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad may follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This seems to be very helpful, but what if said person was smiling about something else? what if the person remembers something funny that happened the other day and suddenly they notice they keep getting uninteresting ads that pop up? There would be no way for the computer to tell if it was really the ad that made the person smile. Another issue is how it is used in class. Paragraph six states ""A classroom computer could recognize if a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" How would the computer tell what degree a pupil is confused? If a student looks a little confused, the computer may read this and respond as if the student was very confused, thus wasting the student's time with more help than they need. One more way to look at it is the privacy violations the software may bring. What if a student is opposed to a teacher being able to technologically and truthfully read the students emotions? does the computer take a log of the faces of the students? There is too many suspicious questions in regard to the morality and safety of the use of such software.

The software definitely shows promise. It seems to show how far we have come to understanding the relation to facial expressions and emotion.

5f7439b,"Using this new form of technology called the Facial Action Coding System ,which is being used to identify human emotions, could be a good contibution to society. But, in my opinion technology that is used to read our emotional expressions would not be that valuable because there are not a lot of things we could use it for and we are capable of expressing ans sensing our feelings on our own.

If we were going to start using this technology, what exactly would we use it for?

There are not many actual reasons that we would need it. In the article they bring up how this technology could be used to tell if a politician or celebrity was lying or telling the truth. Which could be important because we would not want to be supporting someone who lies to everyone to get them to be on their side about something. Other than that this technolgy does not actually hold a lot of value.

Also, I do not think that we need technology to help tell us how we feel. We are all capable of knowing how we feel. If something makes us happy then we will smile and if something made us sad then we might cry. So, having something to tell us how we feel is kind of a waste of time and money which could be used on more important things that we need as a society.

In conclusion, this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System used to identify our human emotion does not hold any value. It may have a good contribution to some people who are not able to sense or express their feelings. But I do not think it is important enough to be used on a daily basis for certain people.

To me this would not be valuable. this coding sysytem to read emotions to me would be completely useless, think of having to take out every computer in every school just to add a feature to know if your smiling or frowning. makes no sense when we already have phones that have face ID/ face recognition that can do that for us. when the article started using examples of different muscles in the face, that was confusing and seemed pointless to know, if this is an accuarate system or app, they should just make it and let us find out for ourselves.

I think using anything that has to do with our face when it comes to technology is unlocking our devices for privacy, i rather know my device is safe from my own face then a password on a keyboard that can be readily accessed if wrotten down. think about adding this mentioned feature of the system reading your emotions. you have a computer tell you what your own personal emotions are but how accurate can this be, if it says you are feeling a certain way and you feel something completely different, then is this considered fale advertising?

Is this going to be an app or an entire software system? if you can easily access your windows or chrome web browser store and get a free download or even pay for it, will it be an app? because i guarantee no one will pay a high amount of money just so they can have a computer read you your own emotions, its

pointless and would have no effect besides unlocking your system or device.

What if someone passes by and it grabs a part of THEIR face, what if the things around you grab ahold of the system and it produces false information? i understand maybe if it shows anger or boredom it can remind you to keep working but what if students have concentration problems really bad and cant focus like everyyone elseand the program still doesnt help, do we just keep those kids lost? this program seems like an insane waste of time just to have feedback on how they THINK you feel. just because my lips or eyes are in a certain position doesnt mean im feeling that way, i could be in the best mood ever and move my muscles into a shape and would the results be same? would they be real to what i actually feel? or will it come back as im happy and faking it? i think svcientists should invest their money, time, and effort into something that would actually help us instead of something that has no vbalue and is pointless to classrooms, the workplace, or in general.

Each student learns at their own pace and by sitting infront of these computers they can learn and actually enjoy learning.

Having this type of technoloy in the classroom is really beneficial because it can tell if something is wrong. In the article it states ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This show that if a student in the classroom is being bullied or going through bad things at home the computer can read that and send some type of alert out to the teacher. This benefits the student because they teacher would be able to sit down with them and help figure out a way to solve his/her problems or how to seek help.

Using the Facial Action Coding technology in the classroom is very valuable because it can read more than one emotion they are feeling. In the article the author states ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This shows that when a student sits infront of the computer it will analyze every part of their face to find how much they are feeling of each emotion. Reading all their emotions is quite beneficial because if they suddenly get very angry or sad they teacher could be notified and they could be pulled out of class to ask what is wrong instead of causing a big scene.

Finally, the Facial Action Coding may have its flaws, but it comes out on top with pretty good benefits especially for students. Putting this in classrooms could save a lot of bad things from happening and help our sociecty grow stronger and more intelligent.

This is a good idea, because not only will it keep students on task, it will also encourage students to pay more attention in the future.

The main reason this technology could prove useful to a classroom environment is, as the article states, the fact that the student's computer could notice if he/she is becoming bored or confused. This allows the computer to react accordingly to grab the students attention just like an effective teacher. Keeping the student focused on the computer makes the lesson more through and easier to learn.

Some may argue that the computer can misunderstand or even tricked by false expression. However, it says in the article that by studying how the muscles act when revealing a normal vs a fake smile, the computer easily identified what a fake smile was. This renders the use of fake expressions obsolete, allowing the computer to affectively teach and recognize student needs.

That can be relly good and funny because that can make you happy if you are sad and imagine that the electronic device tell you ""Smile don't be sad and be fun"" in my opinion that would be good too. If that happen a lot of people would be happy because that is a really good stuff to make the people happy.

If i could create a electronic device i would create like a phone, a computer or pc with that thing of know if the people are sad or something like that because that is cool. If i can do that something on my life i will do it because i dont like to see the poeple sad, angry or whatever.      ",2,7,0.7030656337738037
60e148b,"I'm going to talk now about a such interesting articte called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"".

This article talks about how a new type of technology for the computers called Facial Action Coding System is able to ""calculate"" your facial expressions and know how do you feel in that exact moment; sad, happy, surprised, angry... The author show an example about the Mona Lisa of her facial expressions, and that was de result of it:

""She's 63 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry"". The process for this new system begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face with all 44 major muscles. Every time those muscles moves create a new expression in your face, and depend of the movements of your muscles you will have one emotion or another that the computer will detect.

I think that is an a good idea but it doesn't convince me at all. Dr. Huang say "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", and ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"", my opinion for this is that when you are at the school and you are reading something that it looks interesting for you and makes you happy, you will not be smiling at the screen of the computer, you will just be enjoying yourself about what are you reading. So if my muscles are not expressing any emotion the computer will probably detect that I'm bored and it will change what I'm reading. And for this reason I think that woul be a problem in more than just one situation.

I did like this articte but I didn""t simle when I was reading it, so my conclusion is that I don't think that a computer will be able to ""calculate"" your emotions looking the muscles of your face. ",2,7,0.9168416261672974

Well according to the University of Illinois, the latest software from Prof. Thomas Huang of the institued for Advanced Science, can detect your facial expression. With this new software it can change our perspective on viewing our emotions.

With the knowledge of being able to know different expressions it will become much easier for learning envoirnments at schools. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is beoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. The software can recognize the expression and can change the lesson to make it a little bit more interesting or understandable. The software can detect your characteristic movement of the facial mucles. Being able to read students expession will make everything easier for the teacher and for the students also.

The software will create a big impact on learning enviornments to create a better understanding of the students emotional expression.   ",2,7,0.8368813991546631
6139fd7,"Have you ever spent hours sitting in front of a computer doing school work, learning from a computer-animated face, or simply browsing the web? Have you become bored and uninterested in the process? Professor Thomas Haung has created a computer software that can detect emotions. FACS, the Facial Action Coding System, can be useful reading students' emotional expressions in many ways. A few examples include adjusting a lesson the student is learning if the software detects that they are confused or bored, making computer-animated faces more expressive, and relying on the fact that most human communications are nonverbal, including emotional communication.

If a student is spending hours on a computer, whether it be doing homework, studying, or simply learning a new lesson in school, it is likely that they will become bored or confused in the midst of their work. If the FACS were to be installed onto their computer, the software would be able to detect the students' change in expression and emotion, and modify the lesson, homework, or stuyding that the student is doing. This would simulate an effective human instructor. It would also help the student get their work done quicker, and they will become interested in what they are doing again.

FACS would greatly lend a hand in the making of computer-animated faces more expressive. This software could help show more emotions among computer-animated faces, such as disgust, sadness, fear, jealousy, etc. By showing more expressive emotions, the FACS would largely help students become more interested in what they are learning, if they are learning from a computer-generated person. If the person hardly shows emotions and is not very expressive, the student will likely become bored and uninterested in what they are doing. However, FACS can help prevent that.

An important way FACS can be of use is simply detecting human emotion. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Because computers, and technology in general, are the future, it is vital that computers can understand that. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. However, if you frown when a Web ad appears, the next ad will be different. This will generally make the users experience on the computer more content, as they are not bothered by annoying ads.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System could greatly be useful in many ways. Students can become more interested in learning, studying, or doing homework, computer-animated faces can become more expressive, and most human communication is nonverbal, making it vital that computers can understand that.

614de08,"Technology is so amazing nowadays. Imagine a technology that could tell your emotion...well, it is a thing. The technology that can see and detect your emotion, it is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology could be very useful in some situations. Professer Thomas Huang is the inventer behind this magnificent technology, also with the help of Professer Nicu Sebe. Professer Thomas and his colleague are very brilliant and are coming up with better ways for computers to be even more smart. This technology may even be useful in classrooms.

The Facial Action Coding system can tell your emotions. It all starts when the computer comes up with a 3-D model of the face it will be indentifying the emotion for, it will look at the 44 biggest, and most useful muscles of the face, any movemnt of any muscle can show how you are feeling and the emotion you have. The muscle called frontalis pars lateralis, is the muscle that moves and does the most when you have an excited or suprised emotion. The muscle called the orbicularis oris is the muscle around your mouth that tightens when you are angered.

The Facial Action Coding System can detect all emotions. If you are happy, sad, angry, suprised, disgusted, or in a state of fear, the Facial Action Coding system can detect the emotion. The image may not always show a singe emotion, the model being shown could be happy, but still could be in fear of something, the technology will detect it. The technology can detect a single emotion, yet it can detect weather an image has a mixed emotion.

The Mona Lisa picture is a good example to use explaining this technology. Professer Thomas Huang used this technology on the picture of Mona Lisa and it not only said what emotion was in Mona Lisa's face, but it calculated the percent of what the image was showing. The Facial Action Coding System calculated that the image of Mona Lisa was 83 perecnt happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

All technology could buffer sometimes. This could be a downfall in the technology. Never rely on the technology always working properly. The Facial Action Coding system may be a great invention, but it may not calculate the model perfectly everytime.

The Facial Action Coding System could be a great oppurtunity for students in classrooms, not only could they just see the emotion that the model or image is feeling, but they will know the percent and the exact emotions the image is showing. The students could learn more about the face muscles and how they play a big part in what emotion an image is feeling. It would be very valuable for the Facial Action Coding System to be in classrooms for students to get to use.",4,7,0.8776945471763611
616eaa4,"In this essay, I'm going to talk about the new softare, that is called the Facial Action Coding system, which can help the computer to knows if we are sad, happy or angry. Putting the example of the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's called Mona lisa. I'll explain why this software is a very good idea, for the teachers and the students too. The software can calculate ""emotions"" like math homework. Just recognizing the subtle facial movemets that persons use to express how they feel.

The new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising application for a variety of industries. It's a new software that can recognize emotion, and it's the last innovation from prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague Are experts that are trying to do better ways for human an computers to communicate. This process begins when the computer does a 3-D model of the face; creating at least of 44 major muscles making it move like human muscles. Eckman has classifies six emotions ( happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddnes) Associating each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example: your muscles above your eyes rais your eyebrowns when you are surprised. The software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.

A big example is The subject of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona lisa. Da vinci studied anatomy to thelp them paint facial muscles for paint special emotions. This subject is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how this can computer can do. Your PC can't handle the use to decode Mona lisa smile. But this invent can write down simple instructions that ""encode"" differet emotions. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

This software makes the computer could recognize when a student is bored or confused, then it could modify the lessons, like an human, It's great right?. It can indicate the difference between a genuinie smile and a forced one. To finish with some cientifics conclusions and understand better your boddy. According to the Facial

Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not ont only express emotions, but also may help produce them. A example is when a drama coach tells to his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage because empath might happen when you see someone else expressions.

In conclusion a think this is a good idea, because you can problably know when a friend is feeling just looking on his face, so imagic that a software in your computer can know that, is amazing right?. Also this project helps a lot to the students when a subject is hard and they get confused, this is going to help you, or when you are reading too much, then you get bored. This software project would act as an human.",3,7,0.9119049310684204
61749b6,"Technology that can read your emotional expressions is very valuable to students in a classroom, because it can provide information on how you are feeling. It provides emotions that a humans eye cannot detect. A lot of people dont realize how others are feeling because they hide their emotions. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) created a facial system to detect the emotions of a person's face. This system is very valuable because it gives better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

This software constructs a 3-D computer model of the face with all 44 major muscles in the model. Eckman classified six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness and he asscociated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles. A big amount of students dont focus because of the distraction around them. A teachers job is to keep them focused at all times, but sometimes it is hard for an individual person to keep track of so many students. This techonolgy can help students in many different ways. By weighting the different units, the software can identify mixed emotions, which can help the student by making the work they are doing simple or more difficult. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It modifies the lesson, like an effective human instructor.

The FACS is a very valuable techonolgy for students because it helps to guide them through a problem they might be facing. It can help a classroom full of students that are confused on a lesson. The software can detect their emotional expressions and switch up the lesson to make it more understandable. For example if a student does not undertsand the problem, the computer can detect his or her confusion, and it will modify to fit his or her understanding.

Recently a new technology has been found that enables a computer to identify emotions in humans. It is called the Facial Action Coding System, the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Haung. Imagine how significant this would be in use in classrooms all over the world. It could decrease confusion and boredem, encourage students to learn and help teachers see signs of stress or depression.

The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could really come of use to teachers attempting to get students to learn effectively. In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This new technology could show teachers how effective their lesson was. It there are students who are bored, he/she could research or come up with new ways to get the kids engaged in lessons. FACS would also reveal confusion in students. Students sometimes get freaked about asking for further explainations because of how they might get judged. With FACS, teachers would already be able to see student that may be confused and be able to help them.

Teachers adjusting their teaching practices also may assist students in learning more. Not all students learn the same way. If a teacher teaches one way, and one fourth of the class looks confused, she may be able to adjust her teachings and teach another way to help those kids who did not understand.

Being in school isn't always the easiest thing in the world. Everybody goes through things. Having FACS may help out kids who need it. If a student is constantly coming into class and the computer reads that, it is a sign to the teacher that that child may need help and too scared to ask for it. In paragragh 7 of the article is says, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This device will help teachers see the warning signs and help prevent students from doing something they later regret. It will allow students to get the help they need when they are too afraid of asking.

This program would be incredibly efficient in schools all over the world. It would allow teachers to see boredem and confusion, help students engage more in their learning, and help teachers notice the warning signs if a student may be stressed or upset.",4,7,0.8448676466941833
61c3e9a,"In my opinion i dont think they can tell what peoples emotions are by looking at a computers because everyone act different ways. For example you can't say just a person is not surprised because they didn't raise their eyebrows.. There is no one way to act for emotion because different people act different way. You can look emotions like math homework because you can tell if math is right or wrong but you can't do that with emtions because it's not fact. For example there are some people who dont show any emtion for anything can't tell me that they are not happy because they dont have smile in their face. I know a guy who gos to my school and he never shows any emtions. For example when he gets a good grade in his geometry test that doesn't mean he is anger. I think it is hard to juge peoples feeling by their face. Some people smile all the time that doesn't mean they have everything perfacts. You can't juge book by it's cover and it is the same for emtion. A book can look old and boring but when you read it you might like it. It's crazy how we think technolohy will know all this things.

The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex. But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions. This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students.

Because of this new and itelligent technology, doctors and others are able to read emotions of people in a way never previously possible. This brilliant computer ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" (3). including all major muscles. With the ability to do so, this computer scans and creates a human face and, based on the position of the muscles, is able to determine the distribution of emotions felt at that moment by a person. Tested with the Mona Lisa, this model ""can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (4). By comparing the chosen face against an emotionless one, this advanced techonology allows the ability to use muscle positions to analyze the feelings of a person. The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society.

The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions. If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away. With the ability to control the pages on their computer screen, students will feel empowered and influential, giving them confidence and increasing their work ethic. With an increased work ethic, students will remain productive and efficient with their time and materials. The content of the student's lesson can also be adapted based on their emotional behavior. Dr Huang, the innovator of this technology, describes that at school, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (6). By allowing the computer to customize the lesson, students will stay more engaged, as the content they are learning is one that they enjoy. Students will find pleasure in learning the subjects that interest them while also learning about other less-interesting subjects in a more captivating manner. The innovative technology serves to better a student's learning environment, keeping them engaged and interested in the content. Schools will notice increased success rates and knowledgable students. By providing students with the chance to customize the method in which they learn, school will be more enjoyable and students will stay committed to their education. The emotion-analyzing software gives students this chance and will greatly impact the way they learn and the committment to their education.

The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial

6248e6f,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it talks about a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. The new technology is called Facial Action Coding System. At the very beginning of the article, it talks about the emtions of Mona Lisa for she is eighty-nine percetnhappy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful and two percent angry. Honestly, if I was forced to sit for hours and stare at nothing while some old guy painted my picture, I would not be very happy about it. The technology works by constructing a 3-D computer model of the face that it has been presented with all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding SYstem) has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness.

In paragraph six, Dr. Huange predicts that a classroom computer could recognize whena student is becoming confused or bored then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. As a student n high school, I honestly do not believe that Facial Action Coding System is necessary for a classroom. Our biology teacher makes the notes for us herself so the computer would have no way of changing anything to make it interesting. Along with the fact that most human communication us nonverbal, inclusing emotional communicaton, the computer need to understand that also. I believe that this Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a waste of time when there are more important matters at hand in this world. WIth the recent school shootings, I believe that we should be spending more time trying to make different types of affective things to protect students when a shooter enters a school. I saw an article about how a school has recently installed bullet proof ""rooms"" into every classroom. Whenever someone comes over the intercom, telling the school that they are under attack, the students rush into the room that can hold up to thriy to forty kids. This is what we should spend more time with. Making sure our students are safe, not trying to figure out whether the emtions of students while in class or the emotions of a painting from a few hundred years ago.

Now, I am not saying that FACS would not be helpful in some cases. It could be used with therapists who have patients that do not want to cooperate with them or a patient in a metnal hospital. The effectiveness in a classroom is very low in many cases. The facts that they can recognize the human emotion based on the muscles of the face like the zygomatice major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Yes it does seem interesting but like I said before, it should not be used in a classroom. I believe the only communication that we should have with computers is emailing and other types of work, like typing out the next best-selling book. ",4,7,0.9122353196144104

I think the use of the Facial Action Coding System is a well needed thing for schools because it could tell your teacher whats going on whether you need help or not or if your going through something and need to talk to someone. The Facial Action Coding System would be a great thing to have in school because some kids are shy an dont like to talk and raise there hands in class infront of everyone and if you dont ask questions when you dont understand something that could cause you to fail the class all because of your shyness.

Yes , the Facial Action Coding System is needed for schools and worth spending some money on for schools all over the world but them again we wouldnt need to invest in this if students spoke up about what they needed and whats going on but some students jus have a sad or mad face everyday for no reason so the Facial Action Coding Syestem may read their facial expressionand say that student is mad , when the student is just doing there normal face . The school board or government shoudnt have to invest in the Facial Action Coding System if teachers take the time and talk to their students some teachers are the reason the students become mad beause they make the students mad when they have to do too much homework or even class work , it also is a better way for humans to connect with the computers as it says that in paragraph 1.

To sum it all up this technology could come in handy in certain situations , the teachers might like it but the students might not , your boss may like it but you probably wouldnt . Its a win win situation for students it would tell others how your feeling and if you sad someone might talk to you to let you know your not alone , and for teachers its benificial because it could help you understand your students more.

625bf78,"In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Faicial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotion. The decussion about the Faicial Action Coding System being good or bad has been brought up. I agree with the clame that the Faicial Action Coding System is actually good and could be usefull.

One sorse of evidence suporting why I agree the Facial Action Coding System is a good thing. It states in the selection that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would be a good thing to have because now in days almost all class lessons are starting to be set up on computere. Say the teacher is looking at her computer and the students are all looking at their computers how would the teacher be able to look at everyones faces and see their emotions towards the lession because your face emotions say it all they say and tell exactly what your feeling. It also states ""The computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" With this technology the teacher wouldnt have to worry about is her students getting the lession or not or if its to easy and boring for some students. The computer would do it for the teacher. This would also allow the teacher to persicely point out who knows what they are doing and how need help. With most students they wont say anything if they arent getting the lesson because either they are afraid to say something or dont feel comfterable asking for help. With the Facial Action Coding System the student wount have to say anything because the computer would pick it all up just by the face your making. Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" meaning the Facial Action Coding System could change the lesson acording to your face emotions. To eitther make the lesson harder cause the computer picks up that you are bored, or make the lesson a little eaiser because you face emotions show you are confused and not getting it.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System is a good thing is becaue it could tell what the subject of some paintings are. Most famous paintins the artist is dead so they arent here to explain what their painting means or is showing so with the Facial Action Coding System it can do it for us. Take the Mona Lisa for example everyone always says that not a smile what is Leonardo da Vinci trying to exspress with this painting. She's 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. This was able to be identified by the Facial Action Coding System. Allowing us to know what everyone has been asking about the painting the Mona Lisa.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea is the computer can pick up not only one emotion but yet pick up mixed emotions. This computer wont just allow you to pic up if the person is happy, sad, or mad. It could pick up if the person is worried or anciest at the same time and you would be able to know exactly how they feel. When you look at a person you can only pick of mixed emotions if the person tells you exactly how they feel but with the Facial Action Coding System it can tell you without even having to ask. Also it could tell you if they are hiding their feelings and dont want to tell you how they really feel.

The Facial Action Coding System is a good thing and a good idea because it can denifit teachers in class to be able to tell if their students are getting the lesson or not, be able to explain art when the artist is dead and cant tell you what hes trying to exspress, and can also tell you exactly how someone feels even when they dont tell you exactly how they feel. These were just a few examples of how the Facial Action Coding System can be usefull and im sure there are plenty more.     ",4,7,0.8544853925704956

i think it would be cool if the technology really do can read students feelings because it would be really helpful for teachers. It is because when students are in bad mood teachers don't understand it so having the technology would help the teachers know that he or she is not in a good mood. Those are the reasons why the technology could do this. In paragraph 8 it said that when you have a false smile you can tell because the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle the risorius which is called the orbircularis oculi pars palpabraeus. In a real smile the zygomatic major which is the muscles that begin at your cheeks bones that lift the corners of your monuth. In 6 paragraph it said that the computer can determine how you feel. for example if you smile then the web ad appears on your screan and if you frown the next ad will be different. it also said that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

Another reason why the emothional expressions is that if they are in a play and you want they to actually feel those feelings. Plus you can tell if that person is being truthful or not.

First off the reasion you can use this technology to read emotional expressions is that Dr. Huang and his clleagus are experts that developed a new emotional - recongition software that tracks these facial movements, with characteristics movements of the facial muscules. For example is the text it states ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" This is how that computer knows how you are feeling, by look at your muscles. If they did have the emotional expressions inside of the class room then you will be able to tell if the student is telling the truth or not.

they talk about how a home pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode someone simle. i think that should make it where no matter what you use it on it can run it. with out having to write it down .

what if someone is fake smiling. is your technology going to be able to tell if your really happy or not?

62edb06,"The idea of using facial recognition technology to identify how someone is feeling is a new one. It is also a preposturous one. You cannot fully understand what someone is feeling by looking at their face, and attempting to do so is an invasion of their privacy. Facial action coding systems should not be used in classrooms.

The idea that you could fully decipher what someone is feeling based on how they look is absurd. You cannot decide for yourself how someone feels based on the movement of their muscles. For example, if someone looks sad, you cannot just decide that they are sad, just because they look that way. If a machine decides I look confused, does it really have the right to change what I am learning? To understand how someone is really feeling, you have to first ask yourself why they might be feeling that way. Once you understand this, then you can determine what is happening. A machine cannot read minds. If I am confused about one thing, the machine does not know what. Not to mention that people often feel varying emotions at varying times of the day. I might be sad one minute, then laugh at a joke the next. I might not understand something, than understand it in the next second. The machine might automatically change something I understood based on a few seconds of confusion. This is not efficient or helpful.

To read someone's emotions based on their facial expressions is an invasion of their privacy. Let's assume this machine can accurately decipher someone's emotions based on muscle movement. What if you don't want people to know how you're feeling? If I am confused about something, and I am embarrased about it, suddenly the whole word knows. It should be up to the student to decide whether or not they want to seek help, not some magical machine. By forcing students to share private emotions, you run the risk of making them less willing to go to school. Who would want to go to a school where everyone knows how you feel at all times of the day? That would affect learning severely, and would definitely do more harm than good. Hindering learning in an attempt to better understand students is not worth it.

Using this software in classrooms would be ineffective, and even if it did work, it would be a huge invasion of privacy. This software should be used on paintings and nothing more. It is not accurate enough to do anything other than hold back human learning. This software is not fit for classrooms. ",4,7,0.8313319087028503

The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a great way to see if someone is happy. It can possibly help others to see the person in front of them and what their emotions are or what that person is 'trying to hide'

It's all about muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (the muscles that begin at the cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth.

The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around the eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is not being thruthful.

Making a fake smile can also help produce a real one. Practicing with putting a pencil across your mouth works the same muscles as when a person is smiling for real.

645bd80,"The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable. This new technology will be very useful in a classroom full of students that one teacher may not be able to handle all on their own. The Facial Action Coding System will help deal with many problems by reading a students face. This may help deal with situations a teacher can not figure out on their own. This software may be able to tell the teacher when the student is confused, upset, or even when the student is bored and needs a more interactive subject or way of learning.

When a student is confused, they may not ask for help to a teacher. The child may be too shy or nervous to ask for a simple example or explanation. This software program will be helpful because it will be able to read the students confused face and tell a teacher that the student needs help. In the short story in paragraph six it states, ""most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This explains how not all people will use words to explain what they are feeling. These students may never speak up for themselves or have the courage to ask a question without the program being here to help deal with the childs needs.

The Facial Action Coding System will not only help with students life in the classroom, but it may also help with a students feelings deeper within. The software will be able to pick out the students who are very upset, and need to talk about their emotions to another person. If a student has a sad face in class, the program may be able to identify what is wrong with the child, and it could notify this information to a teacher or a well trusted adult. In paragraph five of this story it states, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" By having this computer software, it could help out with a students mental emotional feelings as well.

This program will also be very helpful in providing a fun learning environment for the students. In the middle of paragraph six it explains how a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored. It also states that if you smile when a website advertisement pops up on the computer screen it will show more advertisements like that one. If a person frowns when this pops up, it willl show a different, more appealing advertisement. This can be very useful in a classroom. It may make the students more interested in learning. The students might even be more excited to learn now, because the computer will know that the students happy facial experssions mean they are enjoying the type of way the program is teaching them.

The new Facial Action Coding System will be extremeley helpful in a classroom. The students will have a more positive learning environment with this software. The new technology will not only be able to help with a students mental emotions, but it will help them be in a happier state of learning. This new system be more helpful for the students and for the teachers. The Facial Action Coding System is exactly what a school should be using for a overall better work place.",5,7,0.837309718132019

A new software developed at the University of Illinois promises to read and detect facial expressions that reveal how we felt at the moment the picture or camera footage was recorded. The project is now in early stages of development but is already able to read paintings and describe what they feel.

In his text ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto states that "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."", stating that the software can be used to monitor people and detect what products they take interest in, which is an unethical way to push companies into people's lives; moreover, the author claims that students can have their facial expressions monitored so that if they become bored, the computer can adjust the lesson to make it more engaging to the student. Although students have different needs, the usage of surveilance to capture their interest can be compared to the way babies are shown colorful and animated things to keep their attention, which can make the student's attention span even smaller than it has become, alienating and making them more dependant of technology.

In conclusion, the usage of this software to either sell products or monitor students is unethical at the least, and can lead to an even more alienated population.   ",3,7,0.7609516382217407

The Facial Action Coding System(FACS) is valuable for students in a classroom . Reason being is school is the only place students can run to too hide their feelings. If we are able to see how a student is feeeling we can help with any problems , bring classmates together, and have happeir students.

Knowing how your student is feeling as a teacher can be hard because you just cant soak into the childs brain. With the FACS nwo you can , you able to detect hwo that person is feeling . this can help a lot with when a student is feeling sick and it scared tor talk . In the article it says, ""The facila expressions for each expression are universal"", this means it can detect most comman emotion faces . Most human would likr the idea because its almost like your a mind reader with a little computer help .

The FACS would also be valuable for students in a classroom because it would bring classmates together . By know howing their peer is feeling many kids would try to figure out whats wrong with that child. They would definetly enjoy this creaction . "" For instance, you can probaly tell how a friends is feeling simply by the look on her face"". thats how most children think they are reading their freinds mind but technology has expanding it in a more valuable way . Classes are dying to have this creation as of today after reading the article.

Many other students may think that FACS is a bad idea simply because this is showing your personal feelings and some might be insecure of allowing that happen. Parents might get involved and say that they don't want their child going to a certain schools because of FACS . What the parents and some children are missing is the FACS can bring happeir students . I know this because in the article it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomign confused or bored"", and that is a very neccesary detective system . Reason being is because the shy students will never raise their hand and tell the teacher that they don't understand; being shy make it harder for the child to learn. Just being able to identify that about a child can make thier school days happier .

In conclusion to the FACS , the syemtem is very well put together and is very valuable to have in classrooms . Being able to read emotion of a person is similar to being able to read the mid of a person . Meanwhile you have your people who dissagree but, soon as they experience it they will fall in love . ""The Mona Lisa is really intened to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.""

64afb15,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"",the author tells us about the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify humans emotions. This article provides how they can show that this device knows how to make an idenitfication.

First, the author states how this device can read are emotions. This device is idetified as Facial Action Coding System. In paragraph 1 the author states ""at least acording to some new computer software that can recongize emotions"". The author also states in paragraph 1 how ""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computer to comunticate"". This device can reconginze are emotions in a new way that could help are teachers.

Second,the author states that are emotions are getiing identified by a device. In paragraph 6, the author states that,""if you smile when a Web ad appeears on your screen, a similar ad might follow"". Another example in the same paragraph But if you frown,the next ad will bedifferent ""A classroom coputer could recongize when a student is bceoming confues or bored"". Also in paragraph 3,""For example , your frontails pars lateralis mucsle (about your eyes) rasies your eyeborw when your suprised:your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tighten your lips to show angery"". This shows how the device can idetify are emotions.

Finally,the author states how this device works in the situatuion that it does. In paragraph 3,""The process begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles"". Another example,""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This shows that the device can idefity from picture and human facial recongition.

All of this information that this aticle gives might be a good thing for student to use in a classroom. This device could tell teachers if there making there student intrestend in class. It might helpp to learn more about what will make the kids more intrested in class . Instead of sitting there sleeping or not doing anything. This device could make people more happy in classeroom.

64ee98f,"After reading this article I have to a decision that I am in agreement with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. In a classroom setting full of students there can be many emotions. Some are facially expressed. Some are verbally expressed. And some just aren't expressed at all.

In a classroom there are always emotions being expressed in some sort of way. Most of the time we can recognize someone is happy or sad or angry whatever it may be, but what if someone has multiple emotions at one time. They're showing mixed emotions and sending mixed signals? Will we be able to recognize the emotions being expressed? In the majority of these cases we will not.

Fear not,for our fellow scientist have be working on a software that can detect any emotion even mixed emotions. In paragraph 4 Dr. Huang lets us know that the facial expression for each emotion is universal even though individuals show varying emotion. In paragraph 5 he gives an example of how you can tell when your friend is sad but you can have trouble identifying other expressions on that friends face.

In paragraph 6 he said what if a classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. That would be an awesome piece of technology.

In conclusion I think that having this software would be an enrichment to learning environment in schools around the world. This software could possibly prevent suicide. The root of suicide is mainly because of feelings and emotions not being expressed.",3,7,0.7911478877067566

It explains in the text the software can tell you how happy, sad, angry, etc.. the person is. In paragraph one it states,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This explains that this software can tell exactly how you are feeling. The program will first take a 3D model of your face and then examine the movements of each muscle in your face. The computer needs to examine the muscles in your face because the muslces of a real smile and a fake smile move differently. Dr. Huang states,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" This means that when everyone is actually smiling and not faking it their muscles move the same way. This also means when a person is sad their muscles will move the same exact way of everyone else who is truly sad. I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valueable, becuase if that person is sad or depressed then we will know and we can help them get through whatever they are going through. Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This means that humans do not show thier emotions all the time, and computers have to understand that too. This means that humans can hide their emotions and when someone is smiling that does not always mean that they are nessasaraly happy, and when someone looks sad that does not mean that they are always sad. The computers have to understand more than the visual picture. The computer has to understand the muslce part of the face to examine if they are truly happy, sad, angry, etc.. An example of how this technology could benifit us in tremendous ways is if a student is in the classroom and they are very angry, we can talk to them or get them help so they will not hurt anyone or do something not appropriate. Another example on how the Facial Action Coding System could help schools out and benefit us is if someone is super depressed and they are planning on hurting themselves or hurting others around them then we will be able to notice that and try to find help. It will be safer for not just that person but everyone.

Reading this text and really thinking about everything and all the facts, I am for using this technology to read students' emotional expresssions. I do not think the Facial Action Coding System could hurt any school, I think it would benifit schools is various ways. ",3,7,0.913601279258728

it comes down to

emotions.

Us humans preform the same task when it comes to trying to paint sculptures of peope and paintings.

For example Mona LIsa she was a human that alot of people know about because of the well known Painter Da Vinci ended up making a famous painting of her. Her painting made alot of people smile when they seen her cause it showed different types of emotions when looking at her.

But alos say that what if a different type of ad shows up and then you have a sad or different type of expressin or emotion. Then the screen will go to a different ad because it bascially scaneed your face. And it seen how you reacted so it made up some changes.

65b5d44,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) brings students a new type of learning environment. Author Nick D'Alto wrote the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" educating readers on the new facial expression innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleague use this tool to find new ways for computers and humans to communicate. This new system brings a new type of learning, allowing the students to retain and understand information better.

D'Alto is the writer, but Dr. Huang has emphasized that FACS would bring the students a new type of online learning, making them more interested in the lesson. Dr. Huang explains this innovation as he says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor."" (Paragraph 6). This new change would make the lesson more beneficial to the student as it would make the student more interested in the lesson, further allowing them to retain information better later on.

The lesson may be beneficial to the student academically, but is it causing mental health issues as it supports more screen time? FACS is all computer based, meaning less time in the classroom and more time infront of the computer. The student would be conducting this program on a school computer as D'Alto explains, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" (Paragraph 7) the program ends up promoting more screen time, something that students should get less of, instead of human interaction, which our society needs more of. In a way FACS program is not beneficial or valuable to the student mentally as it promotes something that our society needs less of.

This technology could be also very beneficial to those who do not have the best teacher or education available to them. When FACS makes that facial emotion recognition it adjust the lesson, allowing the students to understand the lesson better, as Dr. Huang explained. This would be beneficial to students who have a poor education environment as their teachers might not recognize these facial expressions, causing the student to not understand the lesson which later leads them to falling behind in class.

This new technology has many pros and cons, but also brings students a new way of understanding. FACS could possibly bring grades up along with educational improvement. This program may support more screen time, causing students mental health issues, along with eyesight to deteriorate, but if this program is used wisely, none of those things should happen.

Do you ever feel like your on class but you still don't understand what your teacher is saying? Or maybe your too afriaid to say that your not comprehending the material in front of everyone. Maybe its the oppisite, you completely understand it and now class has left you bored. This is why the Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial because it helps tell who is truthfull, it helps teacher grow, and it can help us communicate with one another.

Not only can this device also known as FACS decipher what emotion we are making. FACS also can tell if the emotion such as a smile from a student or a polotician is genuine. These all have to with the muscle movements within your face. As it says in paragraph 8 in the article there cplete different mucles being used when

a smaile is being forced. I suppose its true that it takes more muscles for frown then it does to smile.

FACS being able to tell whether students expressions are genuine can be very benedfical to both the student and the teacher. For example if the teacher was asking the calss if they had understood the lesson and the facial expressions seemed a bit worrysome then this would help the teacher be able to go back over that certian material a few times and help the student get the help they need. In

paragraph 6 it says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional commuincation."" In this it works the same way if the student has become bred with the material.

There is alot of different things that we need to be able to understand in order to take full advantage of this technology. In order to do that we need to understand each other. Even though we communicate through many facials. FACS will help us move forward in that.

Many people do have this issue where they feel they need to know someones emotion but they cannot read them. I honestly do not believe this device will really come in handy in every day life. I do not see someone talking to their friend and saying, ""what's wrong?"" Well actually do not answer that because i have a great facial action coding system that will tell me how you feel. No one would do that. It is strange for anyone to do that. In school there is also no serious need for this system many student are either sad from a break up or tired from lack of sleep. There is not much that needs to be seen in reguards to students. On the other hand i do see it to be a good thing because you can use it for like people in higher power such as the president or the vice president to see exactly how they are feeling. Overall i just feel like it is something neat to try out but it will not be of too much value.

People will think it is great for a month or so until it goes out of trend and we replace it with the next new cool gadget. This is a cool invention but i view it as unneeded.",3,7,0.7834849953651428
663a45e,"The prompt that will be read is my claim for or against the use of the Facial Action System in classrooms. I will be using my opinion and thoughts on this matter. The information that will be provided to me is from ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"". The evidence I use to support my claim will also be coming from the passage. Should the Facial Action Coding Sytem be used in classrooms on students?

As I read this passage I couldn't help but feeling annoyed by this topic. If the system reads your face how is it getting your emotion? The passage says that the system scans your muceles and gives the feedback of your emotion. Well how can this be pen point accurate if the systems isn't reading someone's thoughts? The system can be easily malipulated by the change of the musceles in your face. Therefore, the system is not giving 100% accurate feedback everytime.

Scanning a human's face and giving them feedback of thier emotion is more complex than that. To know somone's emotion 100% accurate you need to know thier thoughts. If there is no way of knowing someone's thoughts then you will never be able to get thier emotion 100% accurate. Meaning this system is just child's play since it can't read thoughts, only can scan the face as it says. To me this can be a fun little game to do with friends but not for problem that is anymore serious than that.

Should the Facial Action Coding Sytem be used in classrooms on students? As I've made my claim I think it shouldn't. One simple reason, this is not a 100% accurate system. If this was a fun activity and the students was told the system could be incorrect, sure, what could it hurt. So, the system can be used but it is irllevant to the classroom.

6640d05,"Wouldn't it be nice to know the honest feeling and emotions of someone? I personally like the idea. Using FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can help in so many ways, but it also has its downs to it as well.

The Facial Action Coding System was descovered by Prof., with the help of Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe. They wanted to make it to where humans and computeres could communicate easliy. The way this works is that the computer scans a 3D view of the persons face, scanning the muscles to detect the emotion of that specific person. FACS can be benificial in a lot of ways. School, personal life, work, etc. In paragraph 6. it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""

Then Dr. Huang predicts that the computer would be able to modify the lesson and try to help the student learn it in an easier way. This could help the teachers by letting them know who got it and who don't go it. This technoligy could potentially help more students get into colleges and stuff like that. Another way FACS could be benificial is in the medical feild. a lot of people in this world go through something called depression, and usually go to the doctor to get some type of medicine to help with the problem. With the help of FACS, doctors could be able to tell exactly how a person is feeling. This could lead to less suicidal deaths and many more. I personally think that the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea and would be very benificial in this world today.

On the other hand, this technoligy could be hated by some people. There are people in this world that do not want everyone to know exactly how they are feeling. There are people that stay more to theirselves and they like it that way. FACS could make it harder for that specific person to be by him/her self. If a person is feeling sad and mad most of the time, FACS would just bring more people towards that person out of couriosity. Even when that person just wants to be left alone.

Eventhough I see how the Facial Action Coding System could potentially effect some peoples lives in a bad way, I still belive that FACS is a great idea. It should still be worked on more and more everyday and can start making it's way a crossed the world. ",3,7,0.8584030866622925
667bf45,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Yeah, it might be cool to see how one of your friends if feeling, but at the end of the day, that's their problem. This app could be useful in some way but would you really want to calculate someones emotions? There are three ways that this app is not useful including that the app could not be accurate, it could end up making you lose friends, and how it's none of yout business on how anyone feels.

One way the use of this technology is not valuable, is that this app could be a total joke. There is a posibility that this app could be accurate, like in paragraph 3, it says, ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of phychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)"", but in reality, we really can't know. Let's say you download the app and use it on a friend to see how they're feeling. They put on the brightest smile you've ever seen, and the app tells you that the person is happy. In reality, they're the most miserbale people you've ever met. This app may work, but at the end of the say, no one knows what anyone is going through and this app isn't going to change it.

Another way that this technology ins't valuable, is how it can somehow make you lose friends. In paragraph 3, it reads, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprice, amger, disgust, fear, sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" What if you use the app on someone who you tought was your friend and you found out how they really feel about you. You're going to feel so sad and disappointed in that person that you're going to be mad that you used that app in the first place. Or maybe you make a gift for your boyfriend or girlfriend and you used the app to see how they realy felt about the gift only to find out that they hated it. You would feel upset and possibly get your heart broken even more when they break up with you for giving them that terrible gift. This app really isn't a good idea.

The last way that this technology has no value, is that the way on how others feel, is none of your business. In paragrpah 5, is states, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" That statement is accurate, but no one really knows how anyone feels. Picture this, you have a best friend who you think is the most happiest person in the world, never in a million years would you think they're depressed. You download the app just for fun and use it on your friend to see how they really are feeling, you find out that the're really sad. You try to talk to them, but they get mad at you for being in their business and you come to the conclusion that you did do something wrong, because it was none of your business in the first place. How someone is feeling, is none of anyones concern and this app in an invasion of privacy.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. This app can ruin your relationships and there's a possibility that it isn't even accurate. ",6,7,0.7665881514549255
668e16e,"I don't think that a computer can identify human emotion how about you? In this article it talks about a facial action coding system which allows computers to identify human emotions.

But my opinon is I don't think that will work because. I feel like in order to know something about soemone or know how they are feeling you must know the. A computer device can not know you in a way that a human can. Computers may know about you from another source but it will never have that human to human chemistry and connnection. It will never workout.

The author also states that faces dont lie so even if it did work thhat doesn't mean that its correct because it is so easy to fake a smile orfake emotions. But the machine also can identify major muscuular actions and can tell the diffrence between a geniune smile and a fake one just by reading the muscles. I belive that they are trying to say the computer can calculate humans like we do math which is by far not true at all because we are humans and we fake stuff we lie and we do many other things that a computer cannot read.

It would help so many people that are depressed and need help but afrad ask for it. And when people get help with their emotions they become more stable then they were before.

Im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile. You can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile. When you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori. But when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth. The other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes.

This is way i think we should use this technology in the futer. It could help with so many things. People could get the help they need. Life would just be so much better if we all could understand each other.

first,in this paragraph i am going to be writting about how ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal.""in the article it says that some individuals often show diffrent types of expression,for example they used the one not smiling as broadly. what this is showing that this new thing that can identify the emotions could be usefull because it can let ther people know what is wrong with you and why you are not happy or why you are sad. in the article it also said that it can identify mixed emotions as they used da vinci's masterpiece.

second,in this paragraph i am writting about how this could help you with your friends and other people around you. in the article it says that we could already tell how one of our friends is feeling and how they look because we already know them. but it also says that we could probobly have some trouble describing them facial traits. and that is what this new technology does it tells you and shows you th facial traits that convey happy and worried.

third,in this paragraph i am going to be writting about how this could be useful in class and how this could help others. the example they used was a computer and some ads. the ads could tell your smile and if you are happy then another ad will pop up that is similar,but also if you frown the ads will be diffrent. they used a computer in a classrom because in the article it says that this computer could recognize if the student is becoming cnfused or bored. aalso in the article it says that this means that it could modify the lesson to the way you might understand it. this is why i think this is valuable in some cases.

in conclusion,i wrote about how this could be valuable. i said that this could be valuable because this could be used to show the diffrent emotions and how people are feeling. i also wrote about how this could be used in the classrom because it could tell wether they are confused with the lesson and if they are then the computer will modify the lesson to a way that you could understand it. this is what i wrote about in this essay and i am sying that yes this could be valuable in the classrooms.",3,7,0.8373308181762695
66d946a,"Have you ever been in class and started to get bored with an assignment? Well the new F.A.C.S (Facial Action Coding System) may be able to help.

The F.A.C.S sytem is able to tell how you are feeling by reading the muscles in your face. The F.A.C.S system atrificially makes a 3-D model of your face with all 44 muscles. Those muscles are what help control your facial features for example, smiling, frowning and scowling. The F.A.C.S system is able to decode what muscles are being used to show how you are feeling.

The argument about having F.A.C.S in our school systems today is that it is constantly reading our childrens faces without them knowing. People say this is an invasion of privacy for example if a child is at home and has left their computer out when they went to go to the restroom and a parent walks up and looks at the screen it could have some teachers thinking that the students parent is doing the work for them.

I say this argument is invalid because a lot of people don't know that Google has a system in place similar to F.A.C.S where it will listen in on what people are saying and show advertisements that correnspond with that. Another thing Google does that is similar to F.A.C.S is that when you are browsing it will track what you click on and then provide advertisements for those things as well. Another example of things tracking us without knowing is that they're reports that the FBI has monitored people through their webcams if they are under suspect. With this knowledge what is the odds a hacker or someone with computer knowledge has not done this to other people as well? This is why I say the argument is invalid for F.A.C.S not to be in our school systems today.

The other side of this argument that I can support is that sometimes our kids are having bad days and with F.A.C.S monitoring them it causes them to get advertisements that make their days even worse. This could possibly cause our kids to not want to use the internet that has helped them so much and is a facle point in most schools today. Another reason why F.A.C.S might be bad for schools is that it can teach our kids how to fake an emotion to be able to hide something from us or be able to cheat the system and be able to get what they want. This is some of the reasons why F.A.C.S might be bad in our school systems.

Being bored in school can come easy at times, so the F.A.C.S system may be able to help your kid one day by making their day better. By being able to moniter the facial expressions our children have. Hopefully one day F.A.C.S can be used for crimes, mysteries, and even enjoyment;but for now it is a good sytem that is helpful for few but the help it provides is great.",3,7,0.6654815077781677

Knowing how a person is feeling by techlology is very valuable because its a very interesting process to be apart of, it also teaches many people about technology and learning about the action unit of a person, lastly, Its just a very fun job to do and a perfect way to learn about the human face reactions.

First, being able to tell how a person is feeling with technology is a very intresting job/thing to do. The software is the latest innovation form Prof wicth makes it very intersting to work on just becaue its the latest and not many people get to use it. Being able to tell a persons emotions by technology also benefits the person by meating all the experst and better ways in developing for humans and computers to communicate.

Next, the Facial Action Coding System is not only a fun thing to do but it can also benifit a lot by learning any diffrent ways to use technology. Many people may also learn about all types of computers that are able to tell the face experesions of a person. Not only that the person can learn all the diffrent types of like human face muscles. A person could also learn the 6 basic emotions.

Finally, Being able to tell a persons emotions may get very fun to do. For example, In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Slto shows how The Mona Lisa was a very fun itersting to bring a smile on a persons face. In the article the authors give an example of how they where able to tell how Mona Lisa is feeling in her portrate. He found out that Mona lisas smile was not real and how she faked it. Although it might be a very fun thing to do it might also not be the best because some people can be emotional and not be abe to take amd figure out how a person might be feeling .

In conclusion, being able to be a part of The Facial Action Coding Sysytem is a very fun interseting job to do. However people may not like this job beacuse lets be honest thers some people out there who just dont care about how a person might be feeling in a picture.",3,7,0.8426918983459473

You can change the subject of whatever your class is talking about to make someones mood change. You can tell if someone is being truthful about their emotions.

Not everyone will just go up to you and start talking about how bad their day is or how happy they are because they could be very shy or don't like to express their emotions. If you're able to tell if someone is sad or scared you can then think of the best way to make them feel better or make them feel comfortable and safe.

When a teacher can tell if one of his or her students are feeling down they can say something funny or have a fun activity for the class to do, just to get the student distracted with whatever their going through just for a while. Teachers sometimes even will pull you to the side and ask you what is going on and just being able to let everything out can even make you feel better.

Knowing when you are upset, angry, or happy, this new technology can change what you are viewing or doing in order to uplift your emotions. With this in mind, the use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom for a variety of reasons. According to the passage, the text states, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This can help in a classroom because when a student is on a school computer, or any computer in general, this new technology can detect what one is feeling when viewing something inappropiate on the screen. Therefore, when the emotion is bad, the screen will automaticaly change to alter what is being seen. The text also states, ""A classroom could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With this being said, the Facial Action Coding System can really help students in focusing and engaging more on the lesson. Many students become bored or confused when a teacher isn't clearly addressing the subject effectively or in a basic, nonexciting manner, and most of the time the students are too afraid to ask or say anything. However, this new technology can detect the emotions of the students and alter the lesson to appeal to their emotions in a way that they become engaged and focused.

In essence, the Facial Action Coding System being allowed to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is quite valuable. It can help avoid students from viewing any inappropiate scenes on their computer screens and help them become more engaged and excited about what they are learning. Consequently, students will learn more in classroom where not only their test scores are of great significance, but their emotions as well.    ",4,7,0.856660783290863
6745144,"I agree with the use of FACS in classrooms this could be a big help, allowing students to learn more and have a better chance at improving in school. This is a good idea because sometimes students are too scared or shy to speak up in class, but with FACS a teacher can approach a student and address the problem by just reading the expression on his/her face. FACS enables computers to identify human emotions by constructing a 3-D computer model of the face, the model must have all 44 major muscles and they must move like human muscles. The program classifies six basic emotions, which are hppiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness.

This idea goes way beyond just reading facial expressions, this could literally change the way humans live their every day life. No one would be confused anymore on what a person is feeing, and people would be able to understand their own mood and others. This passage gives a numerous amount of examples of how this could benfit our world today, in the text it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" It is also stated in the text, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive, for video games or video surgery.""

With FACS entering the world their could be plenty of changes, and of course with change, everythng isn't always going to be good, but this creation is showing nothing but great promises to allowing our future to improve. This is why i feel like every one should support FACS, this could help the younger generation to imporve in school, and even help out the generation now allowing communication skills nd task to become alot more easy. People would be able to understand how a loved one is feeling or maybe even a co-worker, people's lives could be saved as well, because if someone is facing depression you can be able to read their emotions and ask them whats going on or help in a way, this is why i feel like FACS is a good idea and should keep progressing.",4,7,0.8504109382629395

Have you ever been told that you woulden't understand you don't know how I feel or what I been threw. Now what if I could tell you how to know how they felt would it help? There has been a new development recently with how to tell what the person is feeling anger, sadness, happy, confused.

The list could go on it has the ability to tell the mixed emotions and give you a percent of each emotion. Thomas Huang, of the insitute of Beckman with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the Univesity of Amsterdam.

They have been testing this software on people and a well known painting you might have heard of made by Leonardo da Vinci.

The painting if you haven't already guessed it is the Mona Lisa Smile. Who was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. You might be thinking can this really calculate your emotions also how could it tell.

Then it moves the model's 44 major muscles in your face accordingly to mach yours. then it would relies on psychologists Dr. Paul Eckman the creator of FACS work to classify it into the six main emotions ""happyness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"".

Compare it to a natural face it is classified into the different groups unmixing the mixed emotions. What do you think about it would you want this to be a normal thing in schools work or at home.

The Facial Action Coding System is a 3D computer model of the face. It uses your facial muscles to determand how your feeling. For example if you are feeling anger the computer would know because your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show the anger.

Technology is a valuable resource for students. The new technology called the ""Facial Actions Coding System"" would be great for students. This is something that will be able to read your face and let people know if your bored, tired, happy, sad, and it even shows your fears. If your stuggling on a test or an assignment it will give you help and walk you through some of the problems. This would help many students understand the concept and test scores would be so much higher.

According to the article people are able to tell if you are having a bad day. People can not tell what is wrong with you just because you look sad or upset.

The FACS is being use for students to know how they feel. To know if they are saying the truth. Which is should not be used because some kids just do not want other people bothering when they have probelms. In other cases, kids are to scared to confront an adult with their worries, problems, or troubles. Certain kids prefer to be left alone; however, students should not feel alone. They need people to communicate; however the kids now they are just rude or do not feel like having a relationship with any human they just want to be left alone.

The kids instead should have a friend to talk to that could comprehend how they are feeling in that moment. Some kids are not gonna want to make friends, but at least whenever they need some one to talk to they should have that fellow friend or any person. They should also have a relationship with their parents and not with a 3-D model. The computer can have many algorithms but it can never really detect how you are feeling and how long that person could have that feeling. Any one could change their feelings in the matter of seconds.

Contrary to a common belief that it is wrong to read the emotions or expressions of younger kids just to make sure they are going to be paying attention in class it turns out we already do that as humans:"" in fact we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday. for instance, you can probably tell how. friend is feeling simply by the the look on her face"". Evidently if we are already doing this naturally as humans furthermore it would'nt develoup conflict.

Overall having facial action coding in our modern day classrooms would be very valuable and they would be beneficial for their capabilities to detect what a student is paying attention to the teacer or lesson in class, and also be able to modify class lesson to better them for the students, and finally for their ability to analyze the facial muscular movement.

67f1eb9,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom can be valuabe in some subjects. Subjects like psychology, the studies of human emotions, and sociology. The study of human emotions and how to read them has been a major topic since the Ancient Roman times. There are many words and phrases to depictict emotions and there are so many emotions they are sometimes hard to explain. Emotions can also be tricky to read but with new and developed technology like the Facial Action Coding System certain emotions can be deciphered and used for research.

Reading emotions can be difficult if you aren't a professional like a therapist or psychologist and haven't studied them for many years like people in those occupations have. Being able to read emotions is vital in this current generation because if a fellow person or classmate is feeling depressed, by reading their emotions it could prevent something dangerous from happening. With technology like the Facial Action Coding System it could teach students how to read emotions like loneliness and sadness to get students the mental health care that they need.

In conclusion the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable to educate students and identify students at risk for depression. FACS could help students to notice other students that they may not have noticed before and get them help. FACS could also help students studying psychology and sociology to better read emotions.",3,7,0.7947033643722534
685cd71,"A new source of technology haas been invented that has the power to enable computers to indentify human emotions. This is called the Facial Action Coding System. The first step of the computer is to construct a 3-D computer model of the persons face. This includes all 44 muscles on a human's face as well. They must move exactly as if they were human muscles for the experiment to work. Six emotions have been classified by the model that are the most common expressions of a person in their daily life. These would be happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are all also associated with each and every movement of the facial muscles. The new created technology seems to be valuable to the people that use it today and specifically would have a value for students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track facial movements with the new emotion-recognition software created in the system. It weighs every unit and can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared to a face that show no emotion also clled a neutral face. Dr Huang commented in the artile ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" that he believes "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". This could be a great use to teachers in their classrooms so they know what to explain more on and for which student. As a student, I can assure anyone that the worst thing at school in a class is when you can't understand something. When a student is completely confused, they can loose intrest and also motivation to comprhend what's going in in class. Dr Huang also added that ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"".

This new technology comes with many benifits and advatages for all people of different ages. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students and teachers at school during the day. It will help kids be more proactive and motivated in class knowing that if they don't undertsnad something that help from this system will always be there. It's intresting to see all the new inventions and ideas that continue to be created as years go by to benefit human life and the rest of the world. This is an idea that people need to take advatage of and use at school. For this system to be able to read the expressions of sudents in class will communicate to teachers that a student is in need of more attention than others. The help of the Facial Action Coding System could possibly change the life a kid in class and help shape him into a successful hard worker of today's society.        ",3,7,0.9085646271705627

This system is really useful in my opinion, because you can recognize all emotions someone is feeling. You can recognize by looking at them but only 1 or 2. with this new system you can find them all.

Another reason why this system is a good idea is because even if the person is trying to hide their emotions you can still find it. This new sytem is a great idea/invention. this needs to be known. mor people need to know about this amazing idea.

All in all, i think this is a great system and they should add it to schools. It will help teachers and students. You will recognize every emotion the student feels. It can help lots of people. What do you think?",2,7,0.8671365976333618
68c44da,"There is new technology out there that helps people understand what others are feeling. This may not always be right. Sometimes it could miss read what people are feeling. This technology could miss read, not fully understand, and miscalculate things.

This new technology could miss read what people are feeling. This technology could think that one person is happy when really they aren't. Many people can fake what they are feeling such as actors and actresses. Actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage( paragraph 9 line 6 to7). When actors do this it actually helps them feel the emotion they are acting out. This is why the new technology may get some things wrong. Not everyones face shows how they truely are feeling and it may never fully show what one is feeling.

It may not always fully understand what one is feeling because people are so good at hidding what they feel. Lots of people have trouble showing their true feelings because they may not want to be made fun of. Also they don't want to get hurt by others for what they truely feel. If people are hidding what they are feeling and showing a different facial expression then it would be really hard for this technology to accuratly read someones emotions. Which in turn would make it hard for this to have an accurate outcome.

It would always miscalculate how one would truely feel. Not everything works the way it was made to work. Some thinks may malfunction and have to be thrown away. Some things cant read things the right way. What is someone was happy and it read it as them being sad or even angry. We would know that it wasnt working right.

So if the technology miss reads how people feel. If it doesn't fully understand what one is feeling. Also if it is miscalculating how one truely feels then this would not be the greatest thing to use to tell how one is truely feeling. So most people would say that this wouldn't be such a great thing to have to read hoe one feels.",4,7,0.7771778106689453

Reading emotions can be tricky. But for a computer its different. The idea of basically reading Mona Lisa's mind and figuring out her emotion is somewhat confusing because the Mona Lisa is just a painting and there is no way to know if the Facial Action System is correct because the painting cant actually tell us how it feels.

In the artical it states that ""you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" We dont need a Computer to read students emotinal expressions because it is easy to tell how a student is feeling by how their face expresion is at the time or their attitude. even though this would be a great idea to put in classrooms it would also be conserning for the students because some students dont want people knowing how they feel because it might embarious them. But at the same time it would be good for techers because to learn you have to want to learn and if your in a not so good mood then you wont want to learn and with the Facial Action Coding System the teacher can see if the student wants to learn or not.

The mona Lisa demonstration is very intresting and it shows what all a computer can do. It is very amaizing how far the tech has came. Also it is crazy how a computer can know when you are happy or sad. There is a lot of good things to this subject and also a lot of bad things that come with it. An example of a bad thing is if someone dosent want you to know how they are feeling and they could get mad at you. A example of a good reason to see peoples emotion who seem suspious and up to no good.

In concluision I think that it would be a great idea to bring the Facian Action Coding system into schools because of the fact of seeing the emotions of students that arnt learing or working to the best they can be. Another reason is to help inprove those students and see who needs help or needs someone to talk to because they could maybe be going through a hard time but no one knows and the only thing that could figure is out is the computer software.",3,7,0.8710978627204895

69128c4,"I feel like this would be very useful technology for helping many people in the near future. By having the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) we could tell and understand so much more about the human body that we don't already know about.

The FACS would help us in learning about how exactly how someone is feeling about something or someone. Say, if they could exactly explain how they are feeling we could use the FACS to figure out their emotions. We could also use it in classroom as paragraph 6 says. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" We would finally have the technology to help people who don't understand or are to shy to ask how to do something in the class. The computer would recognize that facial action and go more in depth to help the people who don't understand. Yes, it would make people lose their jobs and bore the other students who already understand the topic but we're still in the beginning faze of the FACS. By using the system we would become way more advanced and learn how to fix these problems. It just takes time to go over and fix. Imagine if we didn't have facial expressions. We wouldn't understand each other and the world would be bland but we do in face have facial expressions and we use them. We've grown adapted to having such a skill but some people don't know how to tell or just can't tell very well. We now put it into technology to help those people and ourselves!

In conclusion, I feel like we would benefit from having and using this technology. As I said above, it would help people understand in schooling, emotions, and in life in general. It would be an even better invention if it became more advanced but we have to use the product for that to happen. I fully support the Facial Action Coding System as it would help us in learning many great things about technology and about ourselves. ",3,7,0.8668254017829895
6943ce3,"In this article the author describes the Facial Action Coding System and descrbes the wide range of its usefullness and power. From this article we can see how this new technology finds emotion through a face as well as how that information looks once it's calculated. From this passage I feel that this technology is very useful and could help alot of people.

One of the many uses for this technology is that it has the ability to help others when they are bored or confused in a classroom. This technology can modify the lesson in order for the student to better convey the information needed. This helps students get a better understanding of the material while still learning in a way that fits that students prefrences. If this were to be in schools today I feel that it would help thoughs who may be failing not because they want to but because they aren't understanding the material.

This technology can also help adults as well wheather it would be for advertising ,for video game companies,or for video surgery. When it comes to advertising this technology can recognize the enjoyment or displeasure you may get out of an advertisment. Say you like it and smile, the computer may regognize this and continue to provide you with similar ads that fit what you like. As for the last two being about video games and video surgery these two can construct faces in a more exprssive way than it would without this technology.

This article shows just how useful this technology is and represents just how far technology has come since. This is an important resource that could help many with alot of things.

Even though that souns radicalis this acutly might work cause the world us growing more and more every day, and if we humans and machines cna get along and work together then maybe we can do so much more. For example if we can calcute how a person is thinking all a math problem than we can find ways to help people out.

Dr. Huang says that even though poeple show varying degrees of expression (like a light smile), but to get passed this useing video imagery, we use each expression to compare it agaisnt a neutral face.

So people think that this program is not worth the time, but overall it is and it should be used more in classrooms so teachers and administators can get a clue on what kids in class want to learn and focus on that. Also they could make classes way more fun.              ",2,7,0.8667267560958862
69654af,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to intepret emotions from facial expressions. Dr. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in order to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness are obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the internet as well. People value their anonymity, and they often go online in order to be someone else - someone different than they are in real life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many internet users are not fond of allowing, especially on the internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would rather no one see their faces and have no customized ads or information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they're] happy or sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many users would forever remain wary that their privacy (and their face) might be compromised.

Praticality also remains an issue for would-be-users of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently their own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many are unable or unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software or would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These are all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty their wallet of a couple thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, or is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that users should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete or exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday user, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Softwares relating to human qualities are often rather inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotions are also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them or fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in a educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most students are often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting their face in a perpetual cycle of anger, disgust, sadness, or even fear. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do care about the emotional wellbeing of their students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotions are often ignored in the face of studying and education - students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would read emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners or facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly or correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp our online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, praticality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a ratherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom.",6,7,0.7441064119338989
6988509,"The innovations in the field of facial recognition and analysis have expanded beyond just identifying someone based on a picture. Now, computers with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can identify human emotions from facial expressions. This innovation would be a valuable asset if used in a classroom environment due to it making it easier on teachers and helping student actually understand and learn the material.

One reason this technology would be valuable in the classroom is the aid it would provide to teachers. FACS can recognize when students are confused or bored by analyzing their facial expressions and each ""action unit,"" which is movement of one or more facial muscles. No teacher can always recognize when a student is zoned out or confused, which is why employing FACS to do it for the teachers would be extremely valuable. One of the primary developers of the technology, Dr. Huang, says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" By recognizing boredom or confusion and notifying the teacher, FACS helps teachers be able to recognize when their lesson is not being effectively heard by their students. FACS also changes the lesson plan when it recognizes that a student is bored or confused, which helps the teacher keep the class engaged and allows them to participate more. Thus, FACS would be valuable in the classroom due to the help it would give teachers by enhancing their lesson.

Another reason FACS would be valuable in the classroom is that it would tremendously help students actually understand what they are learning. Students do not always understand what they are being taught, and even though they might not understand they often do not ask questions to clarify. This means that students are basically just being talked at, with it all just going above their heads. However, when FACS recognizes that a student doesn't understand or is bored it ""... could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" says Dr. Huang. This means that when a student needs help understanding something the computer will cater to each student until it senses that they understand the lesson. This could drastically improve participation and engagement in the classroom by ensuring that each student understands. Thus, FACS would be valuable in the classroom due to it helping students learn more effectively.

Through its ability to help both teachers and students, FACS would be a valuable asset in the classroom. Sitting in classrooms around the world right now are students who do not understand what they are being taught. This could be changed forever with the implementation of FACS in the classroom, with a smaller percentage of students failing classes and a higher level of understanding being a direct result from the implementation of FACS.

Humans can tell how a friend or family member is feeling aswell by the same way computers can tell by our face expressions if your head is down or your face just doesnt look like youy wanna talk that mcould mean that your really not happy or when your face is heald high and you want to talk to everyone that can mean your really happy it all depends on your face expressions.

The mona lisa demonstration is one of the paintings that showes how someone felt Accordig to the facial feedback ''theory of emotion movig your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them''.

Students should have the technology to see how they feel because they would actually understand the emotions people are going through putting a happy face sometimes is not your real happy face it could just be a fake smile.

you can see how fake your smile can be by looking in the mirror and doing these three things.

1. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth 2. Then squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes.

3. Holding that,raise the outer parts of your vheecks up toward your eyes.

One of the greatest painting by Leonardo da Vinci, The Mona lisa was being into questioned it she was really happy or not. WIth the technology we have today by the Facial Action Coding System. They figured out that she's mostly happy but a bit digusted, fearful and a little bit angry. This can be use of techology to read emotions in a classroom so we can know how they feel about us.

In the University of Illinois, Dr. Huang and his students developed a a better way for humans and computers to communicate. They were amazed how far technology has when people now can calculate emotions like math and science. They start off witha 3-D model of the persons face, each muscle on the face can tell how people feel. There are 6 different common emotions, happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnes that characteristic movements move the facial muscles. With it, it can change everything.

When they tried it on the Mona Lisa, it shows that her emotions may have been some kind Da Vinci code with Dr. Huanfs emotion algorithms. It is really useful in computer and science class by how the face muscle move and how the computer analyizes the face and come back with the results. It can work at a normal PC at home, but you can test it by looking in a mirror, smile when your cheeks hurt and see if that is an emotion. It can be a use as an experiment a well, it might also made you a little happy now don't it.

According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only can expresses emotion, but also may even help produce them.

6a5d75d,"I do not think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable when using it to read students' emotions. I have many reasons why I am against this new technology. I believe that unless a person wants to share his or her emotions then nobody else has any business knowing what that person is feeling. My three main reasons why I am against this are because some people hide their emotions because they don't want other people to know about them, emotions are personal, and this new technology will invade the privacy of people.

Fist of all, I will be talking about my first reason that I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I am against it because some people hide their emotions so that way other people don't see them. Many people in the world like to keep their emotions to themselves. They do not like others to know how they feel, but with the new software it will be almost impossible for people to keep the emotions to themselves. In the caption underneath the picture of Mona Lisa, there is a sentence that says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" That sentence explains that this new software will be able to tell exactly how a person feels. No matter how hard the person is trying to hide their feelings they will no longer be able to fool anyone because of the Facial Action Coding System.

Second of all, I will talk about my second reason why I am against this new software. The second reason why I am against this software is because emotions are personal. They are not to be put out in the open all the time. When someone is experiencing negative emotions he or she may want to keep those personal feelings private. Paragraph 7 and 8 state that the face uses different muscles when fake smiling and real smiling. If a person is not happy and uses a fake smile then he/she is most likely indicating that he/she does not want to share his/her emotions with another individual. This software can detect which musles in the mouth are being used when smiling. This means that fake smiles will no longer fool someone who uses this software.

Last of all, I will be taking about my final reason that I am against this technology. This technology is an invasion of privacy towards people. The caption underneath the picture states that this software can detect exactly how a person is feeling. Imagine if this techonolgy was used on a student who had a lot a personal and private things going on in his/her life that made him/her not want to talk about his/her emotions, but then comes along a new software that can detect the emotions of a person. If this is used on that student then that student's private and personal emotions were just uncovered. What if that student didn't want people to know? It's too late now and that student feels worse because he or she did not want them to be known. Emotions and feelings will be detected without that person's consent too.

In my opinion, this new technology is not valuable when it is used to read the emotions of students in a classroom setting. I do not think that it should ever be used on a student, child, or even an adult. If a person feels that he/she wants to share the emotions he/she is feeling then he/she will tell someone. All and all I 100% disagree with this new software.                   ",4,7,0.8818632960319519

This can let us know how that person is feeling.

This system can help other people from getting there feelings hurt. Because you can tell how a person or your friend is feeling that day based on there emotions and how they act. Without this system you may not be able to figure out what type of energy that person is bringing. for example if you were to make a joke towards your friend they might take it personal because they are feeling angry and they take there anger out on you. So you both end up begin mad at eachother and now you're relationship with your friend is ruined.

The FACS will help children in schools and the parents. Because humans they perform the same calculations in there everyday life. The FACS system can help show a parent or teacher that a child needs help because they might look confused and this system can detect that. Because for instense on a test a student might be confused and worried and the teacher might not know that without the FACS. This can help prevent alot of students and parents from failing school and failing as a parent.

Therefore i believe that the Facial Action Coding System is worth it. It is a great tool that can help with many things and many people in this world. This sytem will be a big impact on the world and change alot of things for the better. ",4,7,0.7778162956237793

In my personal opinion is that, yes, you can use technology to create a emotion that you are feeling. You can also use someone elses emotion to tell how they are feeling. In the story (paragraph 9) states that a drama coach, makes his actors try all kinds of diffrent emotions to use on stage, so that others believe their emotions are true. In paragraph 1-3, they aurthor explains that there are all kinds of different schools that are using machinery to come up eith diffrent emotions.

The universities tell us that they have a 3-D computer that can detect the emotion that you are feeling. The computer detects all your facial muscles and they must move exactly like them.

That is my opinion of if others or machiens can detect your emotions. I do believe that they can do that. I also believe that they can make others feel the same way. ",2,7,0.7687088251113892

Of course, most of us would have troubles actually describing each facial triat conveys happy, worries, etc."". Just the computer can know the feeling you feel. if we face with an angry face but meanwhile it showing a happy face to us.""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces one"".

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The computers will know if you're hiding your true feelings which is pretty cool. It's amazing when you move your muscles it would know what your emotion is. People hide they're feelings because it's either they don't have no one to talk to. So when the computers know your true feelings there could be some people helping you. For an example, when you're confused in a class when the teacher is teaching the computer would know that. Some people are afraid to go up to a teacher and ask for help. That's why it's a great idea to use some technology. When the computer knows that your confused the teacher would know and he/she will come up to you and help you. Having this system would make things better. It would be easier to figure out who's confused or not. Plus the teachers wouldn't have the blame if a student doesn't understand what's going on. I feel like the other students in the classroom would think having this system would be great. This new sofare actually works.

6bddec6,"Face Action Coding System (FACS) is a system designed to analyze and predict what emotions are being shown on a human face. The software can detect happieness, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author describes FACS being used to display ads, change video games, and analyze school children to learn wether they are bored or confused. This however brings up some questions in respect to analyzing school children and some dangers as well. FACS should not be used in a clasroom to analyze school children.

To start off, this software is very challenging for a normal computer to run, as in the article D'Alto states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms..."" (D'Alto 7). This statement says that a home PC cannot run FACS which means neither can a school computer as the two are practically identical. If this is the

case, for FACS to beincorporated into the class room, a huge overhall of computers would need to be made. This would require a lot of money from the school system that the school sytem does not have.

Another argument against the incorporation FACS into the classroom is the chance of a breach in security. This FACS system, if used in a school system, could be installed on every computer in the building. This means there would be

constant survailence from the cameras on the computers that would be searching for a student's face to analyze. If these cameras were hacked by an outside person or group, the system would show the hackers everything happening in the school at that time. This breach in secruity could cause catasrtophic occurances ranging from a school shooting where the shooter knows exactly where each person is in the building to a mass heist from theives late at night.

Fianlly, along with the two reasons stated above, FACS could also cause numerous teachers to lose their jobs. As stated in the article, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused ot bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" (D'Alto 6). This shows that FACS can manipulate and change the work a student is doing to fit that student's needs. Because of that, physical teachers would no longer be needed to make, change, or teach a lesson as the computer software is already doing so. This could cause thousands of teachers to lose their jobs sonce they would no longer be needed.

Overall, FACS is a unique and advanced system that is amazing at analyzing human emotions. However, because of the high processing cost, risk of security breach, and the fact that it would cause thousands of teachers to lose their job, the software should not be incorporated into classroms to read students' emotions. Instead, it should be used in other ways that the article states including Web ads and video games.",4,7,0.7357778549194336
6beb899,"The Impact of Emotional Expressions

Many of us whether in elemenatary, middle school, highschool, or even college can relate to the emotions we feel throughout the entire day of school. Many emotions tend to spark when we're learning a new lesson in class. It can range from happiness, sadness to confusion, frustration and etc. But, it isn't always visible to your friends, family and much less your teacher. So, by having the ""Facial Action Coding System"" we can really improve what the students are truly feeling when learning new teachings. It can really come into value when a student is feeling frustrated in class, it can improve grade point averages, and just the simple act of knowing how a person is really feeling can make a situation of learning much more efficent and valuable.

First and foremost, the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a system that can be trusted into scanning and analyzing what students are truly emotionally expressing. They have had the experience of composing and making results for even paintings, and not just basic human behavior. For example, in the article it starts off with the analyzations of the different expressions being produced by Leonardo's Da Vinci's, ""Mona Lisa"".""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". This calculated emotional information from the new computer software can really dictate what even the Mona Lisa is feeling. By sighting this, students from all over the world can use this technological advancement to improve their emotional state while also being able to undertand.

Furthermore, the facial code recognition can specifically detect human emotions simply by muscle movement. In the text, it starts to give information on how a person's smile can be dipicted as being fake or not. ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major"". This specified information can also help in a classroom for when a student is trying to fake their emotions. By being able to differeniate whether a student is doing so or not, it can further help teachers with how they're teaching a lesson. For example, if a student is actually enjoying a lesson it can then be concluded by the teacher that it should make the lesson more understandable yet more energetic.

Lastly, having this type of facial technology can help in classes where showing facial expressions are essentiel in even passing a class. In the reading, it states how drama classes can be improved and be much more efficient when having the ability of having a facial code system to depict their certain emotions. ""Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them....A renowed drama couch, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage"".

All in all, the Facial Action Coding System comes into value in many forms when being used in a school classroom in any certain grade level. Students from all over the world can be more understood and comprehended when they're not undertanding a lesson, when they're not enjoying a lesson, or simply want to be able to pass a course. Their facial expressions can be detected simply by their muscle movements as stated and tested by many universities and science collaborations who have been able to study these advancements. Facial expressions are universal, and should always come in importance when people are feeling a certain type of way. Human emotions can be complexed and even misunderstood at times. But, with this facial code, people can come together and be more sympthatic and empathatic with one another from all over the globe.   ",4,7,0.8682084083557129

Then what would happen would be that students may try to cover the senser or camera to block the machine, making it outright pointless. Not to mention, it would be ripping the users confidentiality away from them as it may record what the user does to more easily tell their emotions. Now it recording the emotions is not bad, but the people who could get their hands on it are. It does state in the text "" 'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.' "" This may be true, but if that is the case, why cant we just read emotions ourselevs, instead of making a robot do it for us.

There is nothing wrong with asking if someone is sad or mad, but there is someting wrong with telling them how they feel.

Yes we all frown, and we all smile, but; what if some of our ways to show our smile are different, then it may be computed incorrectly, causing someone or something to go wrong when using this program.

If a simple person can't figure out what emotions someone is feeling then i dont see why they'll trust a coding system that uses 44 muscle found in your face. To see if your feeling whatever emotion your feeling based on how your muscles where being used at the time of the scanning.

For classroom use i see zero ways this can improve anything for students. Because students are emotionally unstable and there moods can switch at any given time.

The software is so advanced that it can even depict if someone's presented emotions are real or forced. Dr. Thomas Huang, who invented FACS, agruges that this technology would be a great improvement in classrooms, and he is right. By using a Facial Action Coding System, it would help engage students in their acedemics and allow them to reach a new level of potential.

If the FACS was in classroom, their computers would have the capacity to detect when a student is bored, confused, or frusterated. Having technology that could read students' emotions would allow the computers to detect if students were bored, not challenged, or struggling, which would make the computer ""then modify the lesson,"" predicts Dr. Huang, to be more interesting, advanced, or activate helpful tools. This would be a major improvement in schools. If FACS was implimented in schools, students would be less likely to get bored, left behind, or stressed.

If the Facial Action Coding System when into affect, and student no longer felt bored, stressed, or left behind, think of how that would change students' potential! Students would have improved GPAs and grades. They would be less likely to fall short in classes, and therefore take more advanced classes. It is even likely that more students would not drop out of high school, and more would get into college, and with better scholarships.

""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,” states Dr. Huang. “So computers need to understand that, too.” If computers in high schools were able to understand their users' feelings, the students would have greatly improved learning experiences. When there is an increase in educational tools that help students, they will be more likely to succeed.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto goes into great depth about how a new computer system, Facial Action Coding Sytem, can revolutionize multiple industries. He began to describe the famous Mona Lisa drawing and how they were able to calculate her facial expressions with the new facial recognition system. He then broadens the topic by explaining how the computer system actually works. After going into even greater detail about the computer process, he begins to describe the many benefits that the Facial Action Coding System will bring. After reading this article, one can agree that the Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into classrooms to read student's emotional expressions for various reasons.

First of all, the use of Facial Action Coding System could enhance the education levels being taught in classrooms by individually designing lessons for students. At one point in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Prof. Thomas Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6). By modifying the lesson to the students' needs, this can improve testing scores in classrooms, ensuring that most students will easily learn more based on their facial expressions.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System can help with discipline areas among schools. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Prof. Thomas Huang explains how muscles contribute to a large portion of reading facial expressions. At one point he claims, ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity aren't being truthful"" (D'Alto, 8). By pointing the idea out of spotting false facial expressions, the Facial Action Coding System can be used in schools and other places to help detect people who may be lying or trying to hide the truth. Instead of adults trying to pry kids open and ""spill the beans"", they can simply use the computer system to recognize certain facial expressions and then start from there.

Overall, there are many benefits to the Facial Action Coding System, and although some may be more beneficial than others, they each take part in bettering academics and schools in general. By personalizing lessons and helping with disciplinary actions, schools can loosen their grips from a tight load of work on their shoulders and allow the Facial Action Coding System to ""lend a hand"". One can really see how incorporating this system will not only benefit the staff and faculty of schools, but also the many children striving for excellence in academics and character.

This type of technology usage is not valuable to read the emotionla expressions of students in a classroom. It's just going to be a waste of money and resouces.

By using this technology in classrooms, it is useless. It can not read in deatail of how the students are actually feelings, it cannot tell in dept of emotions. In paragraph three it states ""Eckman has calssified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". Here one can see that these computers only reads basic emotions. These basic emotions can be read by humans. We have our fellow humans to be able to tell how we feel, more than a computer.

Begining of paragraph 5 states ""we humans perform this same impressive ""calculations everyday"" and ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". I think that techonology has already been a huge part of our lifes and we don't need a computer to read our emotions. I think if we have that in a classroom then it will ruin the interactions between classmates. Iphones, the internet, computers, video games has all been a huge part of society. People are addicted like it is drugs. Addictions to phones has become worse in recent studeis. People take their phones EVERYWHERE, to the bathroom, to bed, to school, to church, to parties, etc. It has become social network online. Kids barley go outside and play anymore, teens don't hang out much; all because of this small device. I think it is not of value to have a computer in a class that reads emotional expression.

While having a technology that read peoples emotional expressions would futher ruin the interactions between humans, It will be very costly to make such devics and put them in every classrooms. It would just be a waste of money and resources.

The process of this techonology sounds like it will be expensive to build such a high tech decoding. The article also says our PC's is not complex to handle this new techonology. So this new techonology must have complex algoriths to be able to decode a smile. Which will be expensive to make.

I think this type of techonology is not of value to have in a classroom to read students emotional expressions. The technology will ruin interactions between fellow classmats and it will be expensive to put in every classroom.

It could be used to read wheather a student is confused on a question or bored. Which could really help the teacher understand what is wrong with the student, or even help the student without asking them. All computers need to have a Facial Action Coding System to help everyone because if anyone were to know everything it would be a computer.

Humans make the same exact calculations as the computer does. we can just look at someone and know if they are feeling a way. A lot of us have trouble doing that though so that could help out a lot of the kids that dont understand how someone is feeling, or help them know how they're feeling.

6d69401,"In the passage I learned about a new computer software that can read emotion and produce its emotional findings as a percentage. This new software reads a human face and constructs a 3-D model of the face. All 44 major muscles must move like real human muscles. The compuer relies on FACS or the Facial Action Coding System. The computer has classified six basic emotions- happiness,suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.- and then associated each emotion with charicteristic movements of the facial muscles. It then compares the exaimened face with one that shows no emotion to determine what emotions the exaimened face is showing. People from around the world are now finding different applications for this new technology.

The technology could be well suited for a use in the educational field. In paragraph 6 the author talks about how this software could be used in schools. He then goes on to compare it to being ''Like an effective human instructor.'' So this software could be installed into a classroom computer. Then as the lesson is being taught to students it would analyze the students expressions and proceed to modify the lesson. The way it could modify the lesson is to make it more hands on and interactive.

Do I feel as if this new technology could be the wrong use for its properties?Yes, I do feel that way because humans are humans. As such they crave interaction between one another, I don't feel like adding a classroom computer in place of a human instructor would be a good idea.

As far as its pros versus its cons go, it would be a well placed application for the software. As I said before it could modify a computer based lesson for the subject in which it is teaching. I don't think it will ever beat out the enjoyment of doing something with your hands in a classroom lab with the safety and security of a teacher lead course. Yes, I agree that we are moving in a direction of computers being in place of instructors. But, I do not agree that we are moving so quickly in that direction that computers will take away the enjoyment of have a casual relaxing conversation with a teacher.   ",4,7,0.8549647331237793

There is a good side that I see to all if this as well too.

For example, it could be used to help a person who is depressed or really sad. It could help that person talk it out with someone and get the help they need, It can also catch a student while lying to a teacher. Despite these things, I still think it is like invading on someone elses privacy. It could also malfunction and say that the student is one thing but really isn't. Things like that could lead to alot of misunderstandings and confusion as well. It's okay to use it on objects like, paintings but, I don't think it would be such a good idea to use it on humans. A person's emotions is their own and not always needs shared with other people. If they want to express how they feel, then they will. If they don't then they don't. It's the student's choice. I don't think it would be fair to any of the students if it does become okay to use this. I wouldn't really feel comfortable that machine in the classroom at all.

In conclusion, I believe that this technology should not be used in schools or on people for that matter. I think that if we want to say how we feel then we do it ourselves. We shouldn't have to let a machine do it for us. I feel that it shoud only be used on objects. Even though it is a pretty neat machine, it still shouldn't be put in schools.

In the article he talks about technology that has been created to alter the learning curve in our new generations children. The new technology could completely change the way that our new generation learns. By taking a little movement in your face and mathematical putting your face into numbers.

For example, in paragraph six the author says, ""for example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow"". The author tells how this new face decoder could change your learning path by choosing if you should slow down because your confused, or keep up if you follow with a lesson.

The author also talks about testing the reader in this article by making you make a smiling face in paragraph seven and testing if you felt happier just by making the facial expression.

In stanza 1 the technology allowed professeors to find out that the Mona Lisa isn´t all that happy she is also 9% disgusted and 6% fearful while being 2% angry at the same time. This is so amazing because this is possible from 3-d constructed computer models which can recognize and define all

44 human like muscles in the body if they look normal. Some of the ways the computer can tell your emotions is or example, ¨Your frontalis pars lateris muscle raises your eyebrows when you´re surprised, your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger¨. The computer has also learned 6 basic emotions which are Happiness, Surprise, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness. If you go home and try to make a happy face in the mirror you can easily see the muscles that are making you smile but what you didn´t know is that when you fake smile it actually causes happyness which can actually make you for real smile.

6e46ca3,"There is a new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"" that allows a computer system to read humans emotions by their expressions. This new advanced technology isn't valuable in a classroom enviroment. In a classroom it depends on the reason, and the student for this technology to be used. This system in a classroom can be taken advantage, and not used correctly.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" being used in a class isn't very valuable, unless a student is always sad, and not doing well in school. No one wants everyone knowing their personal issues. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" (by Nick D' Alto) it states "" The facial expresstions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (para 4). Dr. Huang is saying that there is several emotions, even though people show expressions very little or not very much. Explaing that not everyone shows too much emotion, because some people might be to their selves. But even if a person is more to their selves the system can still read you're emotions even if you aren't really showing any. In the article it explains how the software can recognize the expressions. In the article it states "" By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's master piece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)"" (para 4). In this qoute it explains the process of the new technology ""Facial Action Coding"".

Some people won't want their expressions read by people they don't really know.

They also might not even want to talk about thier personal issues, because they just don't want to stress about it or because they don't want people judging them. This system can be taken advantage of for the wrong reasons in a classroom, and not be valuable. If this system is used in a class room it has to be for the correct reasons and not just because you think someone is always ""mad"" or ""sad"", and it might not always be the case. It has to be because you want to help a student, because they might be going through a rough patch in life and need someone to talk to. But if this new system is used to help someone, it should be in private; where no one is around.

In conclusion, the new technology "" Facial Action Coding System"" is not valuable in a classroom.

A machine by the name of Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) can tell you exactly how she feels. This new technology can even be valuable in the classroom.

This recently created software scans facial movements. It weighs the different units of expression. Although Mona Lisa is just a painting that doesn't move, she is compared to a neutral face. According to Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe, researchers of FACS, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

It may seem unlikely that Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS, only uses ""six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear and sadness"", but when the computer constructs a 3-D model, it uses all 44 major muscles in the face.

Imagine making a certain facial expression and your computer screen magically changes its settings. In the future Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning. However, the use of software to determine the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is not valuable to the students learning experience.

To start, in order for this new technology to work, students woukld have to constantly be watched by cameras that read their expressions. This is said in the text when it says, ""Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements,"" (D'Alto 4). One can see from this that the students would always have to be watched and their facial movements would all be recorded. This could be an issue of privacy for some students if they do not want to constantly be recorded. It also makes it easy for outside threats to hack this system and watch students or get personal information from the videos. Emotion-recognition software can also be expensive for schools, especially since it doesnt work on normal PC computers. The text states, "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it. Lastly, students facial expressions may not directly correlate with the emotion they are feeling towards the lesson that they are learning. This can be seen in the text when it says, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a stuent is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"""" (D'Alto 6). This exemplifies that the schools want to use this technology to help students learn more effectively by using technology thats like a teacher. For some students this may cause trouble if they make facial expressions, but it's not about the lesson. Such as if a student is told something by another student and the student looks confused, the computer might see that and think they dont understand the lesson. Then it would modify the lesson for the student even if the student understood it just fine. A teacher would be much better at understanding the students emotions in a certain situation than technology.

Students need to be able to learn on their own and to communicate with teachers on how well they´re understanding what they´re learning. By using facial recognition technology, its taking away their communication skills. There are many flaws to the facial-expression technology that make it a bad candidate to use in schools.

It shows advancements in technology that could potentially make everyday activities much simpler.

There is a place and time when this sort of technology could be useful.

However, I feel that this technology is not for everyone.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in valuable for students in a classroom, because it takes away peoples privacy, it is expensive, and students can reach out to teachers if needed.

The first reason why I think that the Facial Action Coding System is uneccessary, is that it takes away people's privacy.

We live in a world that technology controls most of our life.

Sometimes this is useful and it makes our lives much easier. However, when personal information given out on the internet gets into the hands of the wrong people, bad things happen.

The Facial Acting Coding System might make people feel uncomfotable, especially since you are giving away what you look like to the device.

Students might not want to have to be obligated to use this sort of technology, and they shouldn't have to be.

The second reason why I think that the Facial Action Coding System is uneccessary, is that it's expensive.

A lot of money goes into paying for the technology that we use in schools.

Some students get school laptops, which is essential for some of the homework that we are assigned.

Some teachers get electronic whiteboards in the classroom to further enhance the teaching that they do.

However, a Facial Action Coding System is not needed for the amount of money that would go into it.

Most highschools have a lot of classrooms, ours has three floors, and the price we'd pay to put this device in each room would not be worth it.

The final reason why I think that the Facial Action Coding System is uneccessary, is that students can reach out to their teachers if needed.

There are students who struggle with subjects they learn in school.

I happen to struggle learning socail studies since I was in fifth grade.

The biggest mistake I've made that could have lead to this, is that I did'nt reach out to my teachers.

I was getting a D in social studies in fifth grade and it came to the point where my mother made me reach out to not only my teacher, but the principal.

I sat in a room and my mother, my teacher, and the principal all discussed with me why I was going off track and they gave me a chance to improve.

I did not need a Facial Action Coding System to tell me what was going wrong.

Students just need to talk with their teacher if they confused.

The teacher should not have to modify their lesson all the time because students are becoming bored of their class.

There may be a place in time that the Facial Action Coding System is useful, like to detect if a politician isn't being truthful, as stated in the article.

However, this technology just is not fitted for a classroom, because it takes away people's privacy, it is expensive, and students can reach out to their teacher if needed.

6f05de3,"People may argue that emotion reading technology should be used in school. However, using this technology will most likely not be very useful in school environments. This is due to a few minor issues along with just simple facts about how this technology is used. Not to mention the very simple and straight forward ideas of how this technology could be used in the future. So the points to make are the issues with the technology, how it is used, and how it can be used.

First of all, there is the issues with the technology. This begins with the simple idea that Dr. Huang clearly state that, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,""Meaning, that even he understands that not everyone has the same way of showing emotions rendering his software partially ineffective. This is with putting consideration into people simply just ""looking mad"" all the time when the person may just have that kind of face structure and is always happy. Meanwhile it is also stated that, ""So computers need to understand that, too."" Showing that even Dr. Huang knows his software has to be programmed to know all these emotions and he is pulling the knowledge he gives to the software from art-works that are not actually real human faces and sometimes are not very accurate. Leaving his software to be a whole other level of inaccurate and simply just not very trustworthy.

Next, is how the software works. The way this software works calls for computers that can run the software really well putting into consideration that schools will have to waste alot of money on these when he states himself in the article, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This is not new considering schools often times find themselves having problems with how to fund things thye need let alone a software program that can read facial emotions and the computers to run this complex software. To add to this problem with using this software in school comes the idea given when the article states the context following the past idea just about how it reads muscles and how, ""To an expert, faces don't lie"" However, no matter how much they may code into this software the software will never truely be a professional in human emotions without being one, it will simply be guessing.

Finally, the biggest concern is how it can be used in the future. Although the author does state one way that the technology can be used in school it seems awfully useless if like said before the technology is most likely ineffective in every way. However, this technology could be used as he states, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery."" Which is a very valid point not to mention it will go into an industry where they will actually be put to good use unlike helping students who dont know how to stand up for themselves and ask for help. Not to mention how the information given like, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" makes it sound like this technology, if possibly useful and accurate, can be put into good use if put into the hands of detectives instead. This will lead his emotion detector to basically become a new version of the already existent ""lie detector"" instead of a useless class tool to tell teachers when a student is bored or confused when they can simply just speak up.

Therefore, in the end the technology simple will not work properly if it is tested only on art-works and false human faces. Also, if the technology costs the amount of money that it will, then school will not be able to afford getting it anyways. Along with the the final statement that this technology will be of better use being used somewhere else instead of in schools. However, this is not saying it will serve no purpose atall in school. It is simply stating that it may not be worth the costs of rushing to use it.   ",4,7,0.8579537272453308
6f30b0c,"Facial Action Coding Sytems: Good or Bad?

People have bad days at school, whether it is from a home sitaution or just a bad grade. Being upset in school can affect your ability to preform well. This is why it is important for schools to have a Facial Action Coding System.

One reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Systems in schools is because it would help recongnize when the students emotion is low, faster so it would not affect their grade. For example, in the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson."" This proves that if the student can become more engaged then they will do better in school.

Another reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Sytems in schools is because it can give more insight into the student's home life. For example, if the student is having family problems you would be able to read it on their face with the coding system more quickly than through a human's eyes. Being sad could affect a student's scores and plummet their grade.

Finally, it would be smart and affective to have a Facial Action Coding System in the schools becuase it involves intense algorithims that kids could try and solve and maybe build one themselves. The system would promote science, technology, engineerng and math, which is very important. In the passage it talks about the types of algorithims Dr. Huang uses, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical inforamtion as electronic code."" The coding Dr. Huang uses can be taught to students in order to further techonlogy in the world.

However, having a Facial Action Coding System could be a bad idea because it would not give student's the kind of action and discpline they would have with a human teacher. It is important for student's to build a bond with a teacher and to be able to open up to them. In the case with a Facial Action Coding System in the classroom the student's would not be able to have that bond.

In conclusion, it would be very benificial for Facial Action Coding Systems to be put in schools. They could help improve grades and give a better insight into problems a student may possibly be going through. It is very important to be able to read a student's emotion to help them academically. Everybody should push for Facial Action Coding Sytems to be installed in schools.",4,7,0.8142057061195374

This new technology can even identify emotions from a painting as old as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.

The Facial Action Coding System is indeed very valuable because it could help a speaker's performance, performance in the arts, and to know the truth.

This new technology could help a speaker's performance by knowing how he is doing. If the speaker is reading off a long paragraph and the listeners are ""paying attention"" but in reality are thinking about something else then the speaker would know. He would then be able to involve the listeners in his speech, make eye contact or do whatever to get thier attention back. This could benefit teachers in a daily lesson to know how good or bad they are doing at explaining things. It could help when preparing for the end of the semester test and then the teacher would know what to focus on. This could also help when student's are giving speeches infront of the class. They would be able to know if they are doing a good job or not and how to do better in their speech to get a better grade.

In theater you have to act as a different person and you have to get into there position in whatever situation they are in. You can't just read the lines and expect people to enjoy the play. You have to be sad when your best friend died or scared when some is chasing after you. All of these are emotions that the teacher would expect performers to perform. This is why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to better the perfomance in arts. In paragraph 9 the author states ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means that the new technology can make those fake emotions into more realistic for actors who need to seem like they are actually scared, sad, worried or feeling any other emotion.

Furthermore in paragraph 8 it says ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This means that the new technology could help know if the emotions public people are showing is actually truthful or not. If they are faking to be sad about something tragic but in reality they aren't then that would show everyone who they really are. Even though this is invading people's personal opinion and space, it would help to know the truth. This could also cause problems in the world of politics but it's better to be honest than to lie. Everyone deserves to know the truth about politics and what they really think so it would not hurt to know the very truth.

Don't you think that it's better to be honest with yourself and everyone else then faking things? This new technology Facial Action Coding System would helping with that. It could help a speaker's performance by knowing if they are explaining it right. It could help in acting an emotion different from what they are truly feeling. Lastly, it could help with knowing the whole truth about politicians and there way of showing they think about certain things. These are only three reasons why this new technology would be valuable.   ",5,7,0.8210041522979736

According to professor Thomas Huang and professor Nicu Sebe they both have collaborated and established a software where computers can recognize human emotions. This type of technology could not be helpful to teachers or any person who would want to see an emotional experssion of a person. Teachers should not even be bothered attempting to use the Facial Action Coding System to identify there students emotions.

Us humans are very fasinating we have an instint when someone is sad, mad or happy. In the article it tells us ""You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the looks of there face.""(P.5) The text itself even says that we can tell when someone is feeling the way they are by the looks of there face, we do not need a computer to detect someones feeling's.

Teachers know there students they see them everyday for a long period of time, they most likely are not going to be close to them but some students do become close to a teacher. In the text it says ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face.""(P.4) The author is telling us that everytime they do a emotinal expression they compare it to a regular photo. How can that show what people are feeling? In most cases most people have a neutral face when they are sad, mad or happy, they are this way because maybe no one taught them how to express their feelings. So how can you really know how that person feels?

All in all teachers are good the way they are, they do not need to dectect there students feelings. Although it would be nice to use it and come across it but teachers can ask how that person is feeling themselves.",3,7,0.8750733733177185

I wouldnt want other people knowing it.

Say I was at a family dinner and something happened, then I wouldn't want the rest of my family knowing that I am upset. Yes, some of the arguments in the article can be good like, "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Thats great but honestly I dont think this would be the best thing in the world.

The article asks us ""Does your exspression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"" Of course it does, just sometimes we may not know what kind of emotion it is. Sometimes you may not be able to tell it on your face but you can definitely feel it.

Other people do not need to know what is wrong with you, rather you are upset, sad, angry or happy. If you have a smile on your face, thats great, the other person thinks your happy even if you arnt. If I want someone knowing what I am feeling, I am going to tell them. I dont just want them or some computer reading my muscles in my face and telling me what emotion I am feeling.

Technology these days are getting to be way to much. Kids don't need to be told by a computer. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

What if the computer messes up the facial exspression and does something ""different"" to try to ""help"" that kid, but honestly the computer detected the wrong facial exspression and changed the lesson for the kid, when he really understood it.

This is why I dont think this is such a good idea, because sooner or later computers and technology are going to be running the world and later need updated or something and mess evereything up for our upcoming generations.          ",3,7,0.6594295501708984
6fd2b7b,"The Mona Lisa is a very iconic painting by Leonardo Da Vinci; however, no one pays attention to how her smile was constructed. According to the new computer software, Facial Action Coding System or FACS, she's 83 percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful and two percent angry. This software is very useful and can help push technology ahead.

The process begins with a computer constructing a 3-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles must move like a human face. These movements are called action units. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, classified the six basic emotions of facial expressions; happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, and fear, and implied them to facial muscles. The software can even track mixed emotions. For example, the Mona Lisa as she has four different emotions in her picture.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to people's faces., while it shows just how much a computer can do. Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". He continues to go on about how it could modify a lesson like a human instructor. This can be very useful for children and teenagers who are homeschooled and take online courses. The same technology can make computer-animated faced more expressive for video games or surgery.

This FACS machine isnt very necessary for daily life, but can help in the classroom. It is very cool and interesting, and can help teachers know when students are struggling. This software is going to help humans in the future and will only become more advanced. Dr. Huang notes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". He is correct with that statement.

In conclusion, Dr. Huang and his colleague did a terrific job in creating such an advanced piece of technology. This will help teachers and schools in the future. The only problem is the cost of the item, because it will most likely be pretty expensive. Making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.",3,7,0.8281272649765015

Now when we look and think so deep about this picture we can be frightened, in our dreams or whenever.

702a56c,"Is it crazy that now there is a Facial Action Coding System that can identify human emotion in the world? Having a human emotion detected technology system is a bold positive choice in a classroom. A strong device that can read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because, teachers can get feed back on their students about certain assignments, peers can understand one another easier, and overall a better environment as a school. One device easily has three reasons why it would be a great investment for students and teachers.

Reason one, The Facial Action Coding System is positive for a classroom because, teachers can get feed back about certain assignments based off students emotions that the system detects. In the text Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, (par 6)"".

This been said, the evidence above is reactions you can get out of students and in the long run prevent. Not only does the system help the teachers by detecting these emotions, FACS will aslo benefit the students because the assignment or classroom function will most likely change due to the results.

Reason two, The Facial Action Coding System comes to benefit within peers themselves. The author states that "" Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (par 3)"". Getting assignments changed because boredom is a good thing; but, would it be a plus that peers know what one another also think in the classroom too? Muscular action units can easily change the way students look at one another in the classroom.

Reason three, The Facial Action Coding System can cause an overall significantly better open environment of many classrooms and even the whole school.

Also, Dr. Huang has noted that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (par 6)"". The notes above by Dr. Huang proove that not many people such as students to student or student to teacher share what they are thinking or feeling verbally. Would it be so bad for students and teachers to connect overall in the school and each and every classroom?

To gradually sum everything up, The Facial Action Coding System is an immensse benefit to students and teachers in the classroom. Technology that can read emotional expressions of students is valuable because, teachers can build feed back on their students about what is going on in the class, peers can understand one another easier through six basic emotions, and overall a better environment as a school can be promised. Mkaing faces and finding a device that can detect emotion can not only chnage things but open doors for science.

In conclusion, as the text states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them (par 9)."" This evidence above is the exact reason why FACS would be a outstanding investment for classrooms all over.                   ",4,7,0.8978872299194336
7036074,"The article titled ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" describes a new technology known as the Facial Action Coding System (or FACS). This system is able to recognize human emotions. This new technology was developed by proffessor Nicu Sebe, proffessor Thomas Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman. Together, they created this revolutionary software and hope to see it's advancement, not only in the field of science, but in every day life. One of these examples include the classroom, where the ability to read student's emotions would be valuable.

In order to detect human fellings, the system first, builds a digital 3-D model of the human face. This model includes the 44 major muscles used by human's to convey emotion. Each expression is compared to a neutral model so that the computer can detect differences and the movement of certain muscles. The article reads, ""Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit.'"" (paragraph 3) Then, these action units are matched with the action units of the six basic emotions programmed into the system: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. FACS is then able to detect a face's emotion. Paragraph 4 states, ""By weighting the different [action] units, the software can even identify mixed emotions..."" (paragraph 4) The intensive proccess by which FACS works, allows a computer to associate human emotion at an extremely deep level.

The FACS software has many implications in everyday life. Paragraph 6 of the article elaborates on a few of these uses saying, ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your [computer] screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different... The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery."" (paragraph 6) One of the more important uses of the program is at school. While students are at a computer, FACS could detect if the student was becoming bored or confused and could then change or modify the lesson to make it more engaging, therefore providing a positive learning experience for all students. The article says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication..."" (paragraph 6) While human's may have a harder time detecting these deeper degrees of expression, a computer would have no problem. Having a technology that can detect this would help improve the world, especially in the classroom setting.

The technology known as the Facial Action Coding System, described in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", is revolutiuonary.

By comparing the movement of muscels on the human face, the system is able to detect a specific emotion. This system in turn, would have a major impact on everyday life and have major value in a classroom. Hopefully, with the FACS software and other developing new technology, people's learning experiences will be greatly improved upon so that students are provided with an approach to learning that works best for them.",4,7,0.8515872955322266

With this technology you can see all 44 muscles. In the article it says that, ""the computer can classified six basic emotions which include happines,suprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness."" This shows how a computer can do so much just by seeing you're face.

With all this they want people to identify a students emotion. This is valuable because when a student is doing their work they could get confused. With this new system you can caculate their emotions and quickly identify if a student is confued. This can really help a teacher with their lessons. Another way that you can tell is by looking yourself in the mirror. You have muscular units that help you identify how your felling whether your happy or sad.

This famous painting is Mona Lisa in which you find her smiliing can demonstrate her emotions while they did the painting. In the article it shows that, ""shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry."" With this Information a computer can recognize your emotions.

70ad9b7,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he defines how the new Facial Action Coding System allows technology to this day determine emotions of humans. The author uses the famous painting of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci as an example of emotion(s) the computer can detect. However, the new technology is a valuable advantage because it can express all emotions one could feel that could create a positive impact for greater educational opportunites in the future.

The 3-D model of the Facial Action Coding System is described to have a human-like appearance with joints like the human muscle. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individulas often show varying degrees of expression""(Huang). The future of technology is rapidly changing and adapting to become smarter and more like a human mind set. Like humans, the computer can detect if someone may be feeling one way through facial expressions. For example, ""We humans perform this same impressive 'caculation' everyday. For instance, you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Logically, if a close friend claim to say they might feel one way but you might feel they aren't expressing themselves like that. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions...Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of 'Da Vinci Code'!"" From the evidence of Da Vinci's studies of human anatomy, the ""code"" could be used on the FACS to determine a facial expression. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

The use of FACS can be a valuable source in the future to involve computers in communication. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that too."" From a scientific and professional point of view, Dr. Huang indicates that computers should be involved with emotions. It is valuable to say that technology to read emotional expressions of students in classrooms is indeed an advantage that can greatly impact their learning envoirnments. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" From this quote, it is foreshadowing that future education is likely to be involved of more computer activity. The medical and political field could receive a positive impact from this as well. ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery.""

70df38f,"In my personal opinion I would say that the technology to read other people emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not a good valuable. The Facial Action Coding System wouldn't be a good valuable because why would school bother buying the Facial Action Coding Sysytem for their student just to check if they happy or not. Instead of buying Facial Action coding System they should buy school material,books or even online websites for kids to learn,because kids really wouldn't like a computer checking them out if they are happy or sad.

Students wouldnt like to go to school knowing that almost everyday that there going to check their emotions. Everyday there are people that go to school sad,depressed,happy, and exited and those people dont wat to tell other people how they feel like. Even if those people try to fake smile theey wouldn't get away without it because in the article it say's ""In a false smile,the mouth is streched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. So this means that it can detect a fake smile because of our face muscle called orbicularis pars palpabraeus.

Even though it's kinda a cool invention but it shouldn't be for students or schools because sometime students want to fix here emotion by themselve or sometimes they don't want anyone to see that person emotion.

7126e0c,"Mona Lisa's facial expressions were ""determined"" by the Facial Action Coding System. It determined that she was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery"" (D'Alto). This super high-tech machine can identify your emotions based on analyzing the muscles in your face. But is the technology really needed in classrooms?

The knowledge of emotional expressions to teachers can be very beneficial. Everyone knows that kids don't learn the same and keep up at the same pace. Teachers could use this for kids to know how comfortbale they are with the lesson. In the text it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor'"" (D'Alto). This shows that FACS can help students who don't understand the lesson, by looking at their facial expressions, and changing the lesson to fit them.

Others would argue that facial expressions for every person and emotion are different. As the author pointed out in the text, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" (D'Alto), people will disbelieve because not every person shows the same emotion the same way. Some oppossers would argue that the addition of the system to education would drastically bring up the cost. Making schools more expensive and put schools at an advantage.

Although I agree with the fact that not every face makes the same expression,

FACS can identify the way the muscles move to indicate the emotion. In the text it states, ""This process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto). This quote shows how the system works and to identify the muscle movement in your face. While, yes the cost of education will increase due to the addition of FACS, the benefits will outway the costs. Like any technological addition to schools, they use funds and sponsors to help pay for that stuff. Helping kids find a new way to learn and helping them succeed, seems a lot more important than costs.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System will help teachers and students world wide succeed. When teachers know how to fix their lessons based on how their students learn, it makes the job easier for them and they get to see their students grow. Although the FACS was able to identify Mona Lisa's facial expressions, they can be used for so much more in the real world.        ",4,7,0.8949857354164124
7136a44,"Everybody wants privacy. Sometimes it is a good thing to leave a person alone, whether he or she is feeling sad, happy or angry. Using this Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students is not valuable.

There might come a time when a person is sad because he or she has lost a loved one. That person probably would not want anyone knowing how he or she is feeling at the moment. If a computer is used to understand his or her emotions, it could cause that person to be more upset or sad. The computer could acknowledge emotional expressions, but it still has yet to learn how to respond in a situation where that person needs help. In paragraph six, the author states that a computer can know whether you're feeling happy or sad, confused or bored. In school, when a student needs help, the person can just raise his or her hand to get help from the teacher. A computer will most likely use complicated words to modify the lesson.

The problem is the new technology can read emotions, but it cannot really understand the person as much as a human being can. On most of the paragraphs in this article, paragraph eight for example, the author describes about how the computer looks at facial expression to understand someone's emotion. In school, there are shy kids who are afraid to ask for help. Normally, those shy kids are smart students who get good grades. It is true that one cannot just assume all shy kids are smart. But in this case, it is more likely that a shy student will ask help from a teacher, who can understand him or her a little bit better, than a computer that can just read facial expressions.

This technology could also end friendships or relationships. In paragraph seven and eight, the author mentioned that the computer can recognize the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. This would mean that there is no way to hide your emotions. For example, two friends get in an argument because one person was jealous of the other one. In most cases, that jealous person could have hidden his or her emotions, but with the new technology, the other person will know. Sometimes, it is a good thing to be able to hide emotions and feelings from other people.

Using technology that can read students' emotional expressions is not a good idea. For one, it is most likely a computer will not do a better job at teaching students than a human teacher. Also, computer cannot show empathy to someone who is going through a tough time. Last but not least, this technology programmed to be helpful could unintentionally end friendships or relationships. Computers may be useful in many cases, but they can never really do as much as humans.          ",4,7,0.8461887836456299

Professors at the University of Amsterdam and the University of Illinois are trying to work with the system to help their students. If you would use this system in a classroom it would be effective because it could recognize when you have mixed feeling about something or someone, when you are confused about something in class, and when you have empathy for someone else.

The system could help in class when someone has mixed emotions about someone or something. The article stated,""'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.'"" In class, kids show different emotions all the time. The system would help when they were confused about a subject.

If a student is confused about a subject, then they won't be productive in class. The article also stated that ""'the facial expressions for each emotion are universal.'"" Every human has several different emotions, but one emotion could represent more than one. The students could have mixed emotions about it. The system could help figure out how the student is feeling about something. The system not only helps with the mixed emotions aspect, but also the part where you don't quite understand something.

Students in classes will get confused or bored while in class. This use of technology will be valuable by realizing it and wanting to help. Dr. Huang predicted that ""'a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'""This system on the computer could help teachers and students realize when you aren't quite understanding a topic. The computer could then have a modified version of the lesson for the student to help get them to understand. Dr. Huang said,""' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" The computer could help fill in as a teacher to help the confused student. If the student is taking a class online, then the computer could realize the emotion of the student and help out. This use of technology is not only going to be valuable for when the student doesn't understand something, but also when a person shows empathy.

Most people show empathy towards one another, and this technology could help show when someone is showing empathy. The article stated that "" you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" When your friend shows how they feel, you can be effected by it too. The system could help realize if you are not your usual self because you may have empathy for someone else. your emotions could get you distacted from your school work, and then you might struggle in that class. The article aslo stated that "" faces don't lie: these muslce clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" The computer will be able to tell when you have a false emotion on your face. If you aren't being honest with your emotions, then the emotions the computer realizes could effect how you work in class.

Having a system to help read when you have mixed emotions, are confused, or have empathy is why the Facial Action Coding System can help students in the classroom.

Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.

Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too.

In conclusion the technology to read peoples facial expressions is a great idea because the computer could help students out if they dont understand the work just by reading there faces.   ",1,7,0.8576673269271851
716b03a,"I think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is real. I say this because if you look into the computer and have a emotion on your face it will tell you what facial expression you are showing. For example if your looking mean then the computer will think that your angry at this moment. Just how people can look at you and tell how your feeling the new technology can do it to. If the new technology did not work to descibe people's expression then the computer would not do anything, computers are a smart technology and can do lots of things.

It is a good idea to read the emotional expressions of students because computers know how your feeling once you look into it. To figure out how your feeling the computer will take a 3-d picture model of your face. The new technology could only tell six emotions which are happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness.

The expressions people make are very universal. The new technology cannot describe how your feeling if your not showing no emotion. If you smile while ads come on the computer while assume that your demonstrating the mona lisa facial expression because your smiling and thats what they or she wanted you to do. They wanted to bring a smile on your face.

Last but not least i think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is real.

71a1944,"in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the auhor explains that a new peice of technology can calculate a humans emotions called the "" Facial Action Coding"".But is it really worth the students time to use technology just to learn about theirs or other feelings?. its just a waste of time. The technology can only do one thing as the article shows and its just to show what one's emotion are.

In the article paragraph 5 it states that "" in fact, we humans preform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". This cleary shows just by looking at a friends face you can tell if they are okay or not, so we dont need a device to do it for us. in paragraph 6 it states "" For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent"". This shows that just a facial expression can chnage a ad , but is it really that helpful?, not many people watch ads as it is, they skip them. in paragraph 6 it also states "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". this shows that human communication is nonverbal for a good part but why does emotional communication need to be useful? what would we do with the results we got when we test the emotion device? text a friend and show what youre feeling for a quick second?. students will maybe use it at first , but will get tired of it because it just shows emotions and nothing else.

In paragraph 7 it states "" your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile"". this states your home computer cant show the emotons. So by that means you will need a certain device and that will be expensive. Why would a school spend lots and lots of money just for a dveice that shows emotions thta nobody will enventually use. Also is paragraph 7 it states "" these are the instructions for a face that looks happy.... they even indicate the diffrence betweena genuine smile and a forced one"". this shows the indication of a forced smile and a real one , but which people can tell if thier friends have a real or fake smile.

In conclusion we do not need a device to tell us our emotions. we can tell out emiotions and our freinds can too. This device is a waste of time and money for students. The students will use it a couple of times and wont use it because its programmed only to do one thing and thats to show our emotions. This device is not valuable for students just to show emotions.               ",3,7,0.8403377532958984
71b6e79,"Everyone in the world makes different facial expressions everday. It's not necessarily something people try to do, but it is a natural way to express emotion. New technology called Facial Action Coding System allows doctors and scientists to evaluate people's facial expressions as a way of telling how they are feeling. Administrators should use the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom because it is valuable in ways such as engaging students in lessons, being able to tell if a student is experiencing negative emotions, and it will help students learn about facial expressions and what they mean.

One reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the classroom is because it would keep students engaged in lessons. In the article, it says that the computer program would have the ability to see when a student is getting bored or confused. Once it recognized this, it would reengage them in the lesson. This is the same things teachers do, but if a teacher was busy with another student, the computer just completed the task for them. This would be an effective way for students to continue their learning in an innovative way.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System would be useful in the classroom would be that the technology would be able to tell if the student was experiencing negative emotions. If someone knows their friend well, they are likely going to notice if they seem sad or downtrodden. However, if their friend is trying to hide their emotions, they might not even know something is wrong. On the other hand, if the computer systems were in the classroom, it would be able to tell if their were other negative emotions hidden from the human eye such as depression. This is evident from the article when it says that the Mona Lisa painting is, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry""(D'Alto). These results could be surprising to some because to the normal human eye the Mona Lisa seems completely happy and few would guess she's actually angry or fearful. So, this would help administators know if there was emotionally something they could do to help their students.

The final reason the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms is because it could teach students about recognizing facial expressions in people and what they mean. So, the technology is not only useful because it helps the students' emotional health, but also because it could help students help each other. If students learn how the computer tells how people are feeling, and they do the same, then the students will be able to recognize emotions and attain help for people they might think need emotional support. This would go above what humans are able to tell about how people feel on a regualar basis.

So, the

Facial Action Coding System would be useful in classrooms for a plethora of reasons. For one, it would recgonize if students were straying away from the lesson, and it would pull them back in. Also, the technology would be able to detect negative emotions within a student which could be presented to the teacher so they could help the student. Finally, the technology would be able to inform students on how to recognize emotions of people and could teach them all of the science and technological aspects of the sofware. This innovative facial technology could help students a trememdous amount in the classroom.    ",6,7,0.8767629861831665

The technology is called Facial Action Coding Sysytem and it allows it to identify human emotion. Also during this reading i will be using details from the reading to show the vaule of using this technology to help find students emotions.

In this article i found some evidence that supports the claim that it should be able to use this technology on students in the class room or anywhere for that matter. People do the same thing this machine does on a daily basis such as people looking at one another to try and find out what there expression or emotions are. It could tell if kids were going to be happy about an assigment or not or if the kids were depressed or upset about something and needed someone to talk too. Dr. Huang says that this peice of technology works just as well as the doctor working pn your facial tissue and muscles to figure out what your emotions or expression are. And the sam technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive and more human like. Also people can fake faces and make you belive they are fine and dont need anything if they don't have this technology which could change that out come that person has on life, with this technology we could help people and get the help they need in time instead of getting to them too late and not helping at all.

Also during this reading i will be using details from the reading to show the vaule of using this technology to help find students emotions.

71c9986,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author (Nick D'Alto) describes how a new technology known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions. In a classroom setting, this technology would prove itself to be vital and crucial. For example, if a student is becoming bored or confused, then the lesson would modify itself to fit the student's interests. I believe that the use of this technology in a classroom is valuable.

There are many benefits to having the FACS in any class setting. For example, if a group of students became tired and uninterested, the FACS would identify this and change the lesson to change the student's emotions. If James were to suddenly become uninterested in the lesson, then the computer system would modify the lesson. Then, James would become interested in the lesson again. FACS can monitor the facial expressions of him to identify specific emotions. He might be 70% disgusted, 20% happy, and 10% angry. After the system modifys the lesson to the interest of James, then he might become 70% happy and 30% disgusted.

The science behind the FACS is simple. In Paragraph 3, the process of the FACS is explained. The process starts when the computer makes a 3-D model of any face; the model include all 44 major muscles. The six basic emotions can be associated: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, and sadness. If a teacher were to have difficulty in identifying a specific emotion in a student, then the computer system could aid the teacher.

If a student were to become angry at a fellow learner, then the NACS could identify this and the teacher can intervene before any aggression can occur. If a student was feeling sad, but had trouble showing emotions, then the computer could analyze the facial expressions to calculate the specific emotions.

In Paragraph 4, an idea is that the software can even identify mixed emotions. Like in Leonardo da Vinci's work, the ""Mona Lisa,"" the mixed expressions can be calculated. Even if an individual were to hide their emotions, the Facial Action Coding System is still able to figure the emotions. This can prove helpful in identifying if a student needs aid, because their mixed emotions can be figured out. Teachers would have to worry less about figuring out how a student feels.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the FACS enables computers to identify human expressions and emotions. The classroom setting would be dramatically improved, because the interests of students would be incorporated into the lessons. Teachers would have to put less worry into figuring out expressions. Students can be interested in school, because of the FACS. This new technology is crucial and valuable in educating students, and it should be used in all schools if possible.

72209ee,"Did you ever think that a computer can tell a humans emotions? The new Facial Action Coding System has been developed and it improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. Dr. Huang and his colleague are trying to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The Facial Action Coding System can tell your emotions, if you are sad, happy, suprised, angry, etc. On the Mona Lisa, Leonardos painting, they found out that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. So should the Facial Action Coding System be used in a classroom to read students emotional expressions? Yes, it should not be used in the classroom.

It should be used in the classroom because it can help students learn better. In paragraph 6 it says, '' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr. Huang predicts. If you are confused or bored with something it will be harder for you to learn because you are not interested in the topic or how it is being taught. Also in paragraph 6 it says ''then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrustor.'' So if you are bored with something, this computer could modify to make you more interested in the topic and it will help you pay more attention. Also, if you are confused about something the Facial Action Coding System can help you better understand stuff. Dr. Huang says in paragraph 6 that ''Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional connection.'' It is also a good way for humans and computers to communicate. Aslo, a student could be hiding an emotion, so if you have this system you could find out what their emotions are, and you can try to help them out.

Should there be a Facial Action Coding System in every classroom? Will there be a Facial Action Coding System in every classroom that can tell students emotions? Is it a better way for humans and computers to communicate? You can tell many things from someones emotions. Who could have thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.        ",3,7,0.8845472931861877

I think that having technology that reads emotional expressions is very valuable. We could be able to use that to be able to further help out the student if he does not like to talk. It could also help the students because they would be able to tell how they are making other students feel. By taking notice on how the student feels it would possibly stop the student from making a dumb decision and help that student out. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", observes Dr.Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression(like not smiling as broadly).""

I think that having computers that can also scan your face is also a pretty good idea. When the camera on your computer can tell your emotions by facial expression is a great thing, because it can stop certain ads from appearing on your computer when you smile or frown.

722827a,"Emotions and being able to recognize them when they occur have a lot to do with our human ability to learn and pick up information. if perhaps, one is feeling confused, it would be much harder for them to be able to retain information being thrown at them. we see this a lot in the educational environment. At school, students must be attentive and ready to learn before they are actually able to start the process of learning. This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that schools, as well as the education system shoud pay more attention to students' emotions towards subjects, contrasting enthusiasm to pick up a new idea with boredom followed by inability to focus. This being said, the new software being used to detect emotion from facial expressions could be a rather helpful tool in the everyday classroom for years to come.

Every student has a different set of feelings, all are complex creatures with opinions on subjects that could differentiate them from one another. Some are better at learning subjects they are more interested in while others have the ability to devote time into learning any subject that school has to throw at them. The point remaining is that none are the same and so, teaching methods for students should become more indivualized to fit each students unique learning style and ability. It is possible that the computerized Facial Action Coding System could aid in the process of making these learning styles more fit for each student rather than just having them for the masses. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts, 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Having a computer monitor to read emotions from facial expressions could display to teachers how each student reacts to the information that they are learning, allowing teachers to make adjustmants in their teaching styles where they see fit. This could give students the ability to learn more effectively for their feelings towards subjects as they are personalized based on reaction as they continue.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a very complex process consisting not only of computer scientists but also of a team of psychologists using expertise to read peoples' emotions through their faces, using scientific evidence along the way. This could mean that, while it is a newer system, it is a well-proven one, making the classroom a good place to continue perfecting it. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals ofren show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Monda Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Davinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This line from the informative piece displays the process of determining emotions through computer technologies. It shows that it is well-tested and understood by its administrators as well as those in support of it, gaining it credibility as a method tested and used. this means that, while it is a newer technology, it could be used in the classrooms to continue to perfect the software by gaining more facial expressions from students, making it even more effective for its participants.

While the software detecting facial expressions is a good idea for countless reasons, it also has a few downfalls. One disadvantage of this technology could be its lack of other uses besides reading emotions of students as far as classrooms go. Some may argue that installation of this likely pricey software would not be worth the pay or the hassle of overall installation. To this, one could argue that allowing students to have a more personalized appraoch to learning should be enough to convince those against it that it is worthwhile. Students being able to learn in an environment as well as manner specifically tailored to their indivual learning abilities and styles will benefit us as a society not only in the future, as today's current students become tomorrow's important business officials and doctors, but also currently, as these students will have less stress devoted to worrying about trying to learn something they are disinterested in or simply don't understand. Altogether, the good outweigh the bad in this current argument.

Computerized sytems used to understand and display human emotions do belong in today's classroom. The benefits of this approach are numerous for both teachers and students being effected as well as for the future when these students are more outspoken, functioning members of society. This can be displayed that, not only would these systems help students to become more able and excited to learn in their own way, but it would also allow teachers to more effectively complete their jobs by editing approaches to learning to fit each student's individual syle and ability. It is also a well-understood and well backed-up process with scientific study allowing direct research to show its credibiltiy. Having students using this technologuy could also allow for the technology to become more credible as more emotions of individuals are entered into the technology. Finally, the price of these systems would not matter in the long-run as this would be money invested into the future of society as these students grow with a solid, quality education. Altogether, the good outweigh all the downfalls in this experiment and it should be introduced into classrooms in the following years to improve the quality of education.

There is now a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, the process begins when the computers construts a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 muscules, but can only recongize humans; no animals. By having this 3-D model of ones face they can track all of the emotions you have while doing homework, learning a new leason, or taking a test. Once you are done the computer put the emotions into percentages and will show your teacher.

Concidering the fact that this will help teachers know whether a student is struggling and not understanding the material fully, this system would be a very valuable thing to have in the classroom. Even though you most likely ""calculate"" someones emotions everyday, such as a friend when they are sad; no one can tell exactly what everyone is thinking. Yet, Dr. Huang managed to get a computer to recongnize human emotions. One way he did this was by observeing how artists construct the face and how they can capture such strong emotions. Now that schools can have this new system, teachers won't need to try and figure out if anyone needs help. Everyone knows that when a teacher asks if anyone is struggling no one is going to raise their hand because the students are afraid to look dumb. The Facial Action Coding System will now make sure everyone is doing okay and that the leasons are understandable for every student in the classroom.

Although this system could be risky, a computer could see if a student was getting confused or bored and then modify the lesson, just like a teacher. This system might seem dangerous because some may think schools wont need teachers as much anymore, but we will still need teachers to keep classrooms under control. Classrooms will be most likely more under control because when a student gets bored they start to talk, but if the computer can change the leason to make them less bored, they won't talk as much. Yes, there still will be talking and messing around, but there will not be nearly as much. Assuming that there will be less drama and talking, do we really know if this system works acuretly on everyone?

Knowing that every person on Earth has a different face and shows different emotions, how do we know that it will work? What if someone squinting there eyes isn't confused it just helps them read better, then you change the leason and they are now confused because this does not make sense to them. Now the teacher is watching them and making sure they are doing well; when another student is actually confused, but the conputer does not reconginize it. This system may seem all well and good at first, but the more you think about it, the more danmage it could do.

New is always a good thing, but is this system too new too fast. Some students, parents, and/or teachers may not want to have this type of system in their classroom or childrens classroom.

Yes it is a great advancement in our technology but what would be the point of using one for a classroom. In the article "" Making Mona LIsa smile "" the author tells us how the Facial Action Coding System works and how it gets it's results.

I am against the value of using FACS, simply because I do not find the point of using this in a classroom, I feel it could even be a distraction. The Facial Action Coding System will not help a student figure out how to solve a math equation, or tutor a student if one is struggling. Yes this new development is very fascinating and spectacular but what if students use all of their class time on this system instead of taking notes, or studying. In the article the author tells us that the system only looks at your facial muscles. The author himself gives us information about facial muscles, but not once did the author say the system gives you information about the facial muscles, not once did it say anything about helping students learn.

In the second body paragraph of this article the author aksed a question, he asks "" Can we actually calculate emotions like math homework?"" Some could say or think this system is showing how to calculate math problems ,and some could or will assume that the author will answer that question later on in the article. But the author had a different meaning of "" calculation"",it wasn't solving a math problem. The meaning of calculation to the author in this story was to solve someones emotions.

The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that.

Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could help us further understand students and their emotions.

FACS is new computer software that can read human emotions. This isn't regular computer software though. You do not have to talk to anyone or anything. You just simply need to react as you usually would. You're probably asking, ""Well, how can the computer tell me my emotions if I'm not talking to it?"". FACS is advanced software that reads human emotions from facial expressions.

The software begins by erecting a 3-D model of the face and it's 44 major muscles. When 1 muscle or multiple muscles move, it is called an ""action unit"". The computer uses these units to determine the emotions of the user. The designer of this software has classified 6 basic emotions that the computer can read; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Hopefully, the software will soon be able to read more emotions such as confusion and depression.

The FACS was used on Leonardo da Vinci's painting, Mona Lisa. The results concluded the following:

Happy: 83%

Disgust: 9%

Fear: 6%

Anger:2%

Many humans couldn't even come up with that information.

This software is extremely superior and could be very useful in the classroom. It is able to tailor material so that the students better understand what is being taught. The FACS would be revolutionary. Not just for education; but also for therapy. It would be an amazing idea to have this software in classrooms and offices around the world. We humans love to improve.

The new software wants to calculate other people's emotions. People are beginning to make 3-D computer models of faces to see all of our muscles and to see how they move like a human does. As studies say we all have six normal emotions, we have happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and by showing that our facial movements change and move to show our emotion. An example on how we show our emotions are that if we raise our eyebrow to show that we are suprised on what another person has said or done, and another one is when people tighten their jaw and lip that shows that they're angry. The Mona Lisa is another great example because we don't know how she is feeling, we don't know if she is feeling sad, happy, depressed, or many more things.

When you look in the mirror how do you look? People might see the stress on their face because lack of sleep, some others might see sadness because of a break up, and their are many other examples on this topic. Mirrors can't detect if we're sad, happy, scared, and more things becasue it's not a computer, we can detect if we're feeling a certain type of way. We should look at how our face looks when we look, we should look at how different our face changes when we go from happy to sad.

When making a face it might make you feel happy or sad. The experiment and technology shows how people really feel. When people say, ""put a smile on that face"", it might make you smile or chuckle a little bit. Drama coachs or acting coaches might ant their actors or actrecess work on their facial expressions. When someone acts you can sometimes feel how they're feeling, and so if they aren't aren't doing a good job at acting then you wouldn't know hot to feel. People will see how your emotions are and will feel a certain way because of how your expressions are or how your posture is.

Making facial expressions shows a lot on how someone is feeling. Experiments can show many different things.       ",2,7,0.808631956577301
72b2c6e,"Truthfully i don't really think this kind of technology would actually work. A persons emotions are determined by that person only. A computer no matter how many upgrades it has could never fully understand a persons emotions or even how they feel for that matter. A person can have many facial exprecions. They can show many feelings from happiness to saddness,from frustration to anger. If you look hard enough you can tell how someone is feeling by looking at their face but you don't need a computer to do it for you. Yes some computers are advanced enough to be able to tell how a person is feeling but they can never actually know what emotion they have. Sometimes faciale expercions can be unpredictable but if you pay attention you will be able to tell how someone is truly feeling. It mostly takes more then technology to tell how a person is feeling. It takes a real person with real eye's to really see. If somehow the kind of technology that can be able to tell how a person is feeling through facial expresions was developed then that would be impressive. However no matter how advanced the tech could be i believe that only real people posses the real ability to tell how a person could feel. That is how i feel about the facial expression examining technology being developed. ",2,7,0.808238685131073
72daa06,"One's feelings should not be used as some sience experiment. There are many people in the world who have feelings that they hide for persnal reasons, and for someone to get in someone else's head is not right. Emotions should not be calculated because it is an invasion of personal feelings, inner thoughts, and emotional expressions.

People have personal feelings that they dont want shared with everyone. In the article the author introduces a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that allows computers to recognize human emotions. However, this is a complete invasion of personal feelings because everybody has the right to a closed mind. The author has also said that, ""...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Sometimes that's not always the case because people have inner thoughts as well tht they hide.

Another reason why emotions should not be calculated is because people have inner thoughts that they dont want shared as well. Through paragraph 5 it shows how people can see what other people are thinking based on their facial experessions, but that is not always true because some people hide their inner thoughts for the sake of others opinions and feelings. Inner thoughts should stay inner thoughts until the person thinking them is ready to share how they feel. The passage explains how most communication is non verbal, inlcluding emotional commmunication. Furthermore, this proves that if people cannot see certain emotions someone portrays to them than that someone doesnt want those emotions to be shown because it isnt that hard to pick certain emotions out by the way one is looking at you.

Lastly, people's emotions should not be calculated becasue it exposes their emotional expression. This article shows that people have a lot of expression and it can be determined with this Facial Coding machinery. People sometimes express emotions only to help another persons inner feelings. Using what the author has told about this system, for somebody to take a computer and actually go in your head to see what your actually feelings could not only expose yor emotional expression, but hurt someone else's feelings as well.

The invasion of personal feelings, inner thoughts, and emotional expression prove that emotions should not be calculated. People have the right to privacy, even if its only the mind, and this system reveals their secret emotions that should not have to be revealed through test. ",4,7,0.6760159730911255

I don't only think it's bad idea I think that kind of thing should be illegal. Or there should at the very least be a setting to turn it off, kind of like Privavcy mode or something within that collum.

Also, who's to say how accurate this can a be. A lot of people make a certain expression when thy're feeling the compltete opposite. When I'm doing class work and I'm pretty focused my face goes pretty blank on the face. But that does not mean I'm not happy while I'm working.

73679f2,"According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Prof, Thomas Huang and Beckman institute, have made an invention""FACS"", that is able to tell someones expressions using technology. The author states the emotions of Mona Lisa's portriat by using the new technology. Do you ever think is the new invention even worth the pay or even necessary? Many people can be against it and many for it. Myself personally I am for Facial Action Coding System.

The article states, you can tell someones emotions by just looking at them. It also states that we have trouble really describing the facial trait. By using FACS, we can get the actual facial traits in someones face.

According to the author, ""'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling broadly)."" When using the Facial Action Coding System it recognizes the facial movements in a humans actual face even in paintings. Using the ""While Looking in the Mirror"" activity we followed the steps,but what if we were to add something that nobody knew except you. The person looking at you would think you are following the script. When you use that same exact script with the other facial you added, the technology would recognize it in an instant. The author also stated moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

In conclusion we all have our opinion, if using the FACS is good or not. The Facial Action Coding System is a technology Prof. Thomas Huang And Beckman institue invented to help people figure out what a painting is offering us in emotions or even what people themsleves are offering. Either wanting to use technology or our own brains, the only person who really knows is the person who painted the painting and the person giving the facial expression.",2,7,0.8144603967666626

like math homework . There are six classified basic emotions - happiness, surprise , anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associeted each with characteristic movement of the facial muscles . For example , your frontails parts muscle (above your eyes ) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised ;your orbicularis oris (around your mouth ) tightens your lips to show anger . In facts , we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation "" every day . For instance , you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face .

73fece8,"There is so many of emotions, and only we know if we want to show them or not. Emotional expressions help us to show how we feel, or we can only pretend them, that is why I am against with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. We have to think if they really want us to know what are they feeling? We all are humans, so we know that sometimes we feel embarresed of something, and we do not want to people know that. Adding to these we have to have our privacity.

Our emotions expressions help us to show how we feel. If we are sad we have a sad face, if angry we have a face that reference that we are angry as on the paragraph number 5 says "" for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". So there is no reason to have the Facial Action Coding enables computers to identify human emotions.

Emotions expression can also being prentend them. Every single person has problems, and sometimes we are shy to let them know to other people, so we need our privacity, and we have to pretend that everything is all right, when maybe is not like that. If someone is sad, but he/she wants to look she is happy, so there is nothing to do, because is her/his decision. We have to think in the point of view. We can see on paragraph number 6 says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becaming confused or bored"" what about if the student feels emberresed, if everybody that he is the one who does not understans a topic?

But also the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions can help, but if the person wants to. Because people sometimes does not know how to tell people how they feel. Also it could help in differents ways to different careers. For example the police career, when they interrogate people, they can notice if they are telling the truth or they are just lying.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System anables computers to identify human emtions have to be used only in a special case. We have our own emotions, and our unique forms to show how we feel. If we want to be reserved is our desicion, and if we want to show our emotional expressions it is okay as well. Only we decide how to feel, and if we should show our emotions up. We have a right that is call personal privacity, we have to remember that.                                            ",3,7,0.8790196180343628
74053ff,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I disagree with incorperating the Facial Action Coding System into classrooms. Mainly due to paragraph 9. In this paragraph the author states tht the actors are putting on someone else's face. The way I see it is if students know this project is happening the won't be themselves. Another factor would be that some individuals don't produce the same aces as others.

Students often don't ask questions because they don't want to seem as if they don't understand. Forcing a person to get help isn't terrible but it also isn't anyone's decision except that persons. Most students woud probably manipulate this program by seeming confused to get an easier lesson. Who's that helping?

Once students are aware of that this is happening they're more then likely going to take an approach of paragraph nine. A majority of individuals don't show they're emotions because they don't want to burden others. That is they're personal decision. And to be completely honest, that isn't something you can take away. There are ways around everything, as in ""feeling someone else's emotional state.""

Nick D'Alto, developed an amazing idea that can be used in important situations. Such as mental hospitals. Children, adults and elders spend they're lives locked up for various reasons. A major population of patients just can't express themselve's verbally or don't know how. This causes them to be stuck in a home for years, never getting better.

The technology has been continuing to develop, and it makes more convinience world today. Dr. Huang had enthusiasm to use the new technology, called the Facial Action Code System (FACS), for figuring out how it possible to know that the actual emotion of people. The reason why, people sometimes make fake face for hiding something. Using famous paint ""Mona Lisa"", Dr. Huang look for what the actual emotion of the women for instance.

The ""Mona Lisa"" is a remarkbly famous paint, also it is known as mysterious painting. Some people can see the paint of the women is smiling, on the one other hand, some people disapprove it. Dr. Huang figured which FACS would calculate what is the exactly emotion the women has; the FACS can figure out the emotion by looking movement of the muscle. Similary, he avocates that people actually can add this system on the computer in the future. By using advantages of this technology, it will give more profit for their work or educational system alot. The only disadvantage is when people work with such as this technology system, they would require to make smile whenever the situation. Meanwhile, it will not be able to help in the normal life such as when talking with family or friends, because sometimes people do not have to know.

People could finally understand the actual emotional expressions of the Mona Lisa because the FACS created. The FACS is available for figuring out the actual emotions of people by looking their muscle system. It is incredibly an amazing however, people require to consider the situation of using this technology. Because it possible to occur some problem without propriate thinking.

7476964,"Do the computers tell people emotions or what they think? why does the mona Lisa smile make people smile? There are three facts bout why the can not tell emotions or expressions.

The first piece of evidence is there are six different type of emotions and the software would not be able to figure them all out. The six types of emotiond are happyiness, sadiness, angry, disgust, fear and suprised(Dr. Paul Eckman). i believe that computers cant tell if the software can tell whether or not if people have the right or any emotion at all.

In the fourth paragraph Dr. Huang states that "" the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" (Dr. Huang) ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions""( like not smiling broadly).I agree, each individual has their own exprssion that can happen anytime.

The Mona Lisa makes people smile because of how interesting the expression is on her face and how you dont know how she feels. Mona Lisa could be mad, happy, sad, scared, worried, any of these emotions can express how she feels in the painting.

The auther that wrote this artice is stating that software may or may not understand if you have emotions or any expressions. it can not tell because the software is not alive to tell if you are in a mood or not.",2,7,0.8024508953094482

Some people may want to keep their emotions to themselves. It can go both ways if there is someone who is feeling sad then the computer can tell and your teacher can get to see what the best option is to cheer you up.

People can be very hard to read so the idea of the computer being able to tell how you are feeling is really neat because that way humans do not have to do so. People can be able to tell if you are feeling happy,sad,mad and even confused or sick.

In the passage the author states that people have trouble telling emotions apart. In the article it said ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"".

The article specifically stated that people are unsure of what to look for when to see how someone is feeling. I think it would be a good idea to make computers see hoe you feel, but some people might not want their facial expressions to be read by a computer. That is like someone taking a look at you when you are in the shower nobody wants it to happen but if it does they do not feel that great.

There is many different ways you can look at this claim. An individual who is feeling sad will get noticed and problably be sent to talk to someone. When it comes to talking to people i know i do not like to do so. some of the things that would go into this would be not as easy as they imagine it would be. Some people might not like to talk about their feelings. I know i sure as heck do not like to talk about my feelings.

Then again there might be a whole lot of people that would like this to happen to computers. It could be valuable because if a teacher is teaching she or he might be too busy to notice how someone is feeling. normally a teacher can tell what type of day someone is having by the way they walk into the classroom. Nobody wants to feel sad but if they are a person might be able to make them happy by cheering them up.

I do not know if someone would want this to happen or not. The right aproach would be is to have a survey to see how many people would find this useful. People could do a lot of good by having this in schools to tell what type of day a student is having.

""For example you frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised"".

Then that's when Dr. Huang comes in at he says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"".

Dr. Huang uses things like video imagery, the emotion-recognition, it tracks the facial movements. It can track the facial movements in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa. Dr. Huang explain that "" by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions.""

With the advances in the Facial Action Coding System, we will be able to create a more empathetic society and a more comprehensive species.

For example, every human has experienced at least one among these many emotions at least once in their life. Those emotions being: happy, surprised, angry, disgusted, afraid, and sad. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with the characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" (Paragraph 3) If other humans and technology are able to identify these feelings with more simplicity than now, that can lead us into a more interactive society. Some may also not really show emotion much. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal..., even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" (Paragraph 4) This can apply to our more outcast and introverted people who don't neccessarily like showing emotion, so being able to tell how they're feeling will be a large step to a more outgoing personality to those who feel they can't.

Additionally, this technology enhancement can help us to have a more tolerable environment for children and rebellion who don't like going to school or attending certain events. ""It's all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" (Paragraph 7) If a computer can differentiate smiles and their context behind it, we can create a more empathetic world. This technology can also spot liars amongst us, especially larger figures in society. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"" (Paragraph 8) If we can indentify liars and people who are no good with facial cues, we can have a more equal basis amongst ourselves and rid of people who lie and decieve us for fame or attention.

Hence, with the sheer amount of possibilities that lie ahead for us, FACS may be the one thing that can bring us all together. With a world in unison, we can finally have peace. We can also have sympathy and empathy for those close and acquainted with us. This will be a very large step for mankind if we can help advance FACS research.",4,7,0.7667746543884277

The software is the lastest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Insttitute for Advances Science at the University of Illionois. Dr. Huang and his collegue are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate. Eckman has classified six basic emotions. They are happiness, surprised, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness. This software is very good at telling a human's emotions. It also gives an example: your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrow when you are surprised and your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

Students in classes can value this software in many ways. For one, the system can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. If a student get confued or bored, the classroom computer will recognize their emotion. It will then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Some student appear to be shy and quite in class and sometimes are afraid of asking for help. This saystem can help them without even asking and will improve their knowledge.

This system is like no other system. It is unique and different and designed to help students in class. That is why its good and helpful for students. It decribes how this sysem can indicate the differences between a genuine smile and a forced one. I think it is weird how it can tell your emotions but at the same time it is helpful.

In conclusion, students can take this new software seruously and other will not.

This facial coding system is valueable but i feel it has not place being in a classroom because humans can already read emotion, its unneccessary, better alternatives to its use.

The use of this face coding technology would not be helpful in a classroom setting beccause humans can already read emotions. In paragraph 5 the author notes that humans can read facial as well or even better than machines. So this means a teacher would have no problem reading a student's face in order to make sure their not lost. It wouldnt be intelligent to use a machine to read human emotions when anyone can do the same.

The use of facial coding systems in the classroom wouldnt be needed as their most likely uneccessary. The cost of one of these sytems would not be cheap, both students and teachers would be better off communicating. So whenever s student is confused they may ask a question or the teacher could ask the class if they understand. As in paragraph 4 the author states that facial expressions are universal, meaning there should be no confusion in understanding the students' feelings toward the work.

Classrooms may not be in need of the facial coding systems but other professions could use its help. Having established how redundant and uneccessary this sytem would be in a classroom system doesnt mean humans make them useless. Animators or special effect designers would greatly benefit from this technology as their audiance appreciates the amount of detail and emotion that can be put into a character that may not even be human.They would also be able to more easily acheive the desired emotion by how accurate the system is by using 44 muscles in the face.

Facial Action Coding System's technology is a very good technological advancement able to accuralty read a pseron's emotions. Although this a great new technology it doesnt belong in a classroom because the majority of people have no problems reading other's emotions, and if there is any confussion communication can clear things up better rather than just a face scan.

Some case workers deal with people who have emotion diseases such as post dramaic stress diseases in that nature . I feel like the creator could've made the tool for more serious reason, not that the emotion FACS was pointless but who would want to just find out their emotion and they can already feel it or going through it.

I feel like people would want to find out things more important like , whats going with that person , is the person feeling sick , is the person healthy . FACS could been about how's the day going to go , whats the weather going to be like . I feel like FACS is all hype in some way because it's basic , like yay we can see how we feel right?

They took all this time and objects figure how someones doing or feelings , instead of how we're living . Anyone can figure out someone's emotion expresses by their body language , their tone , how their speaking , when their speaking and etc. Often people may not want to speak on how they feel , alot of times teens want to keep their problems and emotions to them selves. Students are diffrent from adults, and also handle emotions diffrently.

FACS would be valueble if they come with conclusions to that person emotion at the time , plenty of ways technology can do things. If the FACS were a solution to a person with a bad day it would be valueble. Due to the fact their making this like it's a cool invention when FACS is exposing peoples feelings and then wat after that? I feel like the FACS should be upgraded and do more with it .

It's fairly easy to know how somebody is feeling simply by the look on their face, but that usually just gives off one emotion. With the Facial System in use it will be capable of giving off multiple emotions on how somebody is feeling. Also, with the system it will be easier to detect Whether somebody is lying or telling the truth. It'll be easier to detect because the percent numbers from your emotions with identify everything your feeling whether its, gulit,mad,sad etc. Another thing that is cool about this system is that it's not just used for the computer it also can be used for game systems and video sugery.

Being able to read emotions from other people using technolgy is cool. supporting this movement can be a big step for this generation. Also,bringing new technology into this world can change the world in many ways.   ",3,7,0.8489376902580261
7736d47,"Its hard reading peoples facial expressions. Some people dont have the type of face where others can take a peek at their face and know whether they are happy or upset. Life just is not that easy. Although being able to read someones facial expressions can get in a way of teaching a student, make others feel bad, and perhaps the technology can misenterpret a facial expression.

Students and teachers alike may feel highly uncomfortable knowing that technology is veiwing their face at every point of the day. Humans now live in the 20th century where technology is booming and will continue to improve. In the article it states that a computer classroom will be able to defrentiate ones emotions and change an ad to best fit the persons prefrences (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). Thats fine and dandy until they change from ads to actual lessions. Lets say that a student is watching a class video independently as are the other students. Perhaps the video is for biology and what is being shown is a dissected frog. Of course watching a frog being dissected can make some students disgusted, but in the end of the day the student still has to learn all this since it is required in the class. Perhaps in order to achieve a good grade in the class the student has to sit through and watch that video to learn.

Having technology constantly viewing ones facial expressions can be pretty unfortunate. The technology can apparently know if someone is happy or sad (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). If it can tell if someone is happy or sad can it tell if someone is lying? Lets say a female student asks the teacher for permission to use the restroom. Perhaps this teacher is strict and does not allow restroom passes unless necessary. Telling the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her mentrual cycle is embarrassing for younger female students; even more so if the teacher happens to be a male. Now having technology that can pinpoint the fact that this female student does not have to urinate would be classified as a lie. Therefore the teacher would say no knowing she is lying about having to pee. This of course puts the female student in a difficult position; leaving her to feel bad and embarrassed about being caught in a lie. There are two choices now she doesn't go to the restroom and risks staining hersle with blood or she tells the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her period and be embarrassed about that too. Having this technology can be greatly embarrassing for many other students too.

Technology is bound to mess up at one point. All humans and technology are not perfect. There is not such thing as perfect, so having technology that reads human expressions around may be cool until is messes up and reads ones expression incorectly. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...,"" (""Making Mona Lisa Smaile""). For exapmle if a student is intrigued by a subject and understanding what is being taught then there is no real reason for the subject to be changed. Imagone that a student sitting in class deeply engrossed in the sunject to vome to school the nect day and have to sit through a boring lession just because a computer read their expression wrong.

It is normal to be excited over new technology. People need to be level headed though and ask themselves whether or not it will be beneficient towards whatever purpose the technology is bought for. The new software Facial Action Coding System can be pretty appeasing when thinking of it at first. Actually owning it and installing it in a classroom can lead to bad consequences like: A student not learning well, making others feel bad, and the risk of the software making mistake.                        ",6,7,0.8584686517715454
773930f,"Is Technology Valuable in the Classroom?

New software has been developed that improves the accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The new software can now detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. Facial Action Coding System has promising applications for a variety of industries. Mona Lisa being on of the pictures used to detect her emotions that were captured long ago.

Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. If the Facial Action Coding System was apart of the classroom, it will essentially distract students from their work. If school corporations were to bring Facial Action Coding System into the school, I personally think the schools should make it an elective class due to the fact that it may make students distracted from their work.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of the Facial Action Coding System classified the six basic actions as happiness, surprise, amger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

During the process, each expression is compared against a neutral face, also showing no emotion. Although, I think that having the Facial Action Coding System in schools, we perform ""calculations"" on one another each day. Humans can tell when a friend is feeling ""down"" or simply having a bad day. Just like when humans are watching movies, one can figure how the person is feeling by watching the actions around them happening or by their expressions presented on their face.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. Having a computer in a room would also help modify the lesson as if the teacher were there. Today, most human communication is nonverbal, including emotion communication making it almost impossible to figure out what one is thinking or saying.

According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them. Each person expressed their emotions differently. Empathy may happen because we unconsiously imitate another peroson's facial expressions. Designing the Facial Action Coding System helped humans learn the process of changing facial expressions and reading each others minds and emotions. Whoever would have thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!",2,7,0.8847514390945435
774e049,"My Thoughts on the Story ""Making Mona Lisa Smile.""

Lets be real first before we get started on the real thing. Who came up with all these weird names for facial expressions and facial muscles, my goodness I thought I was surely going to get taken out of class from laughing so hard at these weird names.

I think that using technology to read someone emotions is horrible stupid. I mean come on why invade someones privacy. Why trust a computer when it can mulfunction, and calculate wrong. Yet some might say its a good thing to invade others personal emotions by using technology to see what their feeling and figure out why their feeling that way. Not everyones facial tissue or muscles are the same nor can you predict what their facial expressions mean as of emotions. Using a 3-D computer model of someones facial structer you can see the muscles of the face in different forms and can tell what emotions are showing.

Example: Your orbivularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show your anger. So the people who agree with using this technology would rely on the 3-D facial model of someone and look for muscle tightening or high raises of the eyebrows, or tightening of the jaw.

People who do not agree on this would say you can not always believe what technology says. Maybe someones facial expressions are natural. For instence someone who was born with difunctional issues; a lip attacthed to their nose, if someone were to use a picture of someone with a lip disorder and the persons lips are tight they assume it is cause they are mad. When in reality they might just be sad because their lip is stuck like that, and your assuming it's tight cause their mad.

Paragraph 5 talks about humans calculating everyday. well for one when the author says, ' You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" What makes you think it's a she it could be a he or a she. Don't assume genders author. Simply some people have trouble showing the right emotions too. For instance you could be happy and have a frown on your face and if someone were to send it the the facial computer and ask what is she/his emotions right now. Well the computer would say they are confused, when really they are happy and just had their face rested in a frown.

In paragraph 6 it says that, "" most human communcication is nonverbal, including emotional comunication. So computers need to understand that, too."" Dr. Huang notes said.

So why do computers need to understand how we feel? If we want someone to know how we feel, we will let them know. What's the point in wasting time working on a computer to figure out how someone feels when you could simply ask and not waste money and time on a computer that could malfunction? The author say's that the Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows you just how much the computer can do. Well it surely didn't bring a smile to my face.

Instead it made me think of lot's of questions on stuff like; what happens if your so called computer malfunctions? Where will everything go? Surely you have everything saved? Have you tested it on many people more than 20? Were those people all the same? Or were they different? Do you know what people will think of it, or how they will react to all this new technology? Why did you use technology? What happens when we go into a blackout and you can't rely on any of the technology? People will want answers and then turn on you cause you relyed on something that can't function without electricity.

Paragraph 7 explains some ""encoding"" emotions and what to do while looking in the mirror then the author says that those instructions are for a face that looks happy. Now if your smart and I shall hope you are, we both know if you go to a mirror and force your eyes to squint and force your lips to move upwards, and then raise your cheeks up. Lets just say that will not look like a happy face, it will look like someone who doesn't know how to smile and is trying ot force a fake smile that looks horrible wrong.

Paragraph 8 talks about how a muscle clue can tell when a politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. Well what if someone asks them a personal question and they don't want the whole world to know? And you go and use that computer on their 3-D face you made and tell the world they were lying to that question. Hm well you just ruined that for them and exposed them. Now I know what your thinking they wouldn't do that, and maybe your right or wrong. Their is always someone who can hack or get the full version of this what do you call it FACS, and that person would probably spill it to the world and thank you for creating that machine. Then you're sucked into the law suits and drama and people who would sew you for ruining the world or someones life.

In paragraph 9 the author says, "" According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Does it really? I mean you can't force a smile, and we all know faking a smile does not make you happy. These facts are from someone who probably just used a couple peoples facial expressions to get to publish his or her's book so why not ask more than a couple peoples opinions and what they say about all this.

I understand why you would want to read a studens emotional expressions during class to see how they feel and what you could do to make it better, but what if it doesn't get better and you try everything you can and their still sitting in calss bored and tired and not giving a rat? Then your stuck with a machine you don't need anymore and less money than you had because you wanted to spend it on a machine then asking the student's what they thought could help them.

Most people would spend money on machines to try to help kids because thats all their used to doing spending money on kids to make them happy, when in reality you just need to have them suck it up and pay attention reward them with things that don't cost a lot or something that doesn't cost anything.

This is my opinion and my thoughts.                                        ",4,7,0.8254076242446899

Students in a classroom are all very diverse when it comes down to emotion. A teacher may not be able to recognize these emotions and teach a lesson wrong in which a student cannot follow. Say a student was angry or sad toward a test score, the teacher may keep teaching in a way that ignores the way a student is feeling towards the class. With the computer identifying the emotion a teacher may change up teaching methods to help said student.

This latest computer technology was created by Prof. Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois used work of psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman. This technology uses 44 major muscles in the face movement's to create an calculation of what emotion the user is expressing. The computer idientifies the user with six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. By recording the movement of one of the favial muscles the computer can identify a person with any combination of the six emotions. In the painting of Da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"", the computer calculated, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

This technology can change the way we interact with devices in our everyday activites. Alto says in the article, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.""

This kind of selection can improve our experience while browsing the internet. This can help identifying the food we like, clothes we like, trips or hobbies we'd enjoy.

The educational value in this is grand as that using the technology of recognizing emotions, the computer can shift lessons so the student can follow along with. ""A class room computer could recognize when a student is feeling confused or bored, 'Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

77bc471,"Human emotion. Once thought to be something held exclusive to humans, can now be interpreted by computers. Allowing anything with a camera to read the muscles in ones face to tell the emotion they currently portray. There are many different outlooks on the future use of this technology, but one in particular focuses on using it in the classroom.

The technololgy used to read our emotions is known as the Facial Action Coding System or FACS. It models a human face and all 44 of its muscles, and looks for certain cues to tell them emotion being conveyed by the subject. FACS can tell when one is happy, sad, angry, cionfused, surprised, disgusted, and afraid. FACS can even tell the difference between ""fake"" emotions and real ones. This means that it can tell if a facial expression is being forced, based on what muscles are being used.

On the subject of use in the classroom, it could be very benificial to students and teachers alike. It can read when a student gets confused on a topic, and can then adjust the lesson to fit their needs. It can tell when a student is feeling drowsy and upset, or when a student is attentive and alert. This way teachers can recognize when a student needs assistance. This technology, in all, can be very useful if applied to them classroom, and even the rest of the world, properly, making it a very impressive step into the future for mankind.

Just think. A computer able to read the human face to determi9ne what emotion they feel. Skepticism is understandable, what with the advancement of AI and related movies such as The Terminator, where AI has tooken over the human race, but a future like that is to be left in the world of fiction. This technology is the next step into the age of human technology integration, like we've already seen with the introduction of smart devices.

77c5de3,"I think the FACS is a pretty clever project. It's mostly accurate and was made with real studies and facts from human facial expression. I think the FACS is a very intresting concept but I do not place it as valuable.

For one, the FACS can't be accurate all the time. Humans are complicated and it's often very hard to tell how they're feeling. Most people like to ""fake"" their emotions. They're smiling but they're actually feeling awkwardly uncomfterble or angrly calm. It can be easy to trick the system, many can fake a genuine smile and confuse the system into thinking wrong.

Another reason is that the FACS doesn't provide any real benefits to anyone. Sure it can be a little fun to test out different emotions to see different ratings but it dosen't actually provide any information that can be very useful later on in life. People have different faces for different emotions, none are the exact same. Similar yes, but it varies and mistaking an emotion for something else may bother said person.

In conclusion, the FACS can be accurate but holds no value to society. It can be good fun, goofing around with freinds when boredum hits you but it's nothing else. It's a one time game that'll get boring quickly and thrown away for the next big project.",3,7,0.6054028868675232
77cb526,"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" or ""FACS"" is not useful or appropriate in the classroom. Paragraph 6 describes that computers basically watch your face to see what ads to use and it could be used in the classroom to see what you understand however, it is not likely that a teacher would want for their lesson to be altered because that can create some problems. Having a computer scanning your face 24/7 could also be viewed as kind of wrong and invasive. On the other hand, if people knew they were being watched, they could easily change the appearance of their emotion. People can be very convincing. Lastly, technology is not 100% correct 100% of the time. Things could always glitch and change things for the worse.

Some might view the concept of a computer scanning your face every time you are in front of its camera as minamally invasive. Everyone has different facial expressions that show different things and it could mean the complete opposite of what the computer views it as. Paragraoh 7 describes that a computer can scan your face to see if there is an ad that you don't like and show less ads like that one. Not only does that have nothing to do with using it in a classroom, but no one likes ads in the first place and you have to pay to get them removed. Also, some teachers like to try and read their student to get a feel of how their day is or see if they're ""living their best life"". While this is sometimes very sweet, sometimes people like to be left alone when they're in a mood. This technology could literally increase the percentage of teachers being in people's business. They already have that Dyknow app that screen records all of our screen so they can see what we're doing at all times, why would they need to know how we're feeling as well?

As an actress and show choir student I can safely say that we, in the performing arts community, can definitely put on a faccade. Others may not be in either of those activities however, people can still be very convincing. Personally, if I knew I was being watched I'd probably fake some of my emotions. People on shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Law and Order"" are paid to put on a fake face. Their job is to literally be fake for a camera. There are episodes of those shows where people are crying and they look very pained. Chances are, they are not really feeling those emotions. Arizona Robins may have cheated on Callie Torres but Jessica Capshaw didn't cheat on Sara Ramirez. That's fake emotion. They might not be it their character is so they have to play that part and be convincing or they don't get the part. In show choir there are songs where we have to be angry and then suddenly happy and then concerned all in a matter of sixteen counts and if we can to that then we can change how we portray our emotions when we are being watched by a camera.

There are so many different applications and softwares tha are in the world now and no matter how advanced the technology may be, it is never always perfectly running. Even the latest technology glitches from time to time. Technology is constantly updating and changing due to bugs in the software. Technology like this could ruin something completely. Everyone has a focus face that they put on when they're reading something or solving an equation. Let's say someones focus face looks a little bit angry. Just because their face looks angry does not mean that they don't like the question or don't like how it's taught or explained, it just means that they're focused on what they're doing. If the software misreads a facial expression and changes what's on the screen it could completely mess up what the student is doing. Or if the student does need the way of teaching adjusted and it does change. it could cause problems with the teacher because some teachers want things done a very specific way. If something happes with the software and it could inconvenience the student in many ways.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System should not be put in classrooms. IT's not completely useless, but it it's not very useful either. People don't need their face read to see how they feel about an ad or about a teaching style, that's why surveys were invented. If someone wanted people to know hwo they felt every time they turned on a computer, they'd start a blog. There are really bad actors on this planet but there are a lot of liars and pretenders. If a lot of people knew they were being recorded and faked a smile because they think that their privacy is at stake, it would completely defeat the purpose of the system and it would all be for not. Technology is also very expensive these days and this type of thing can easily be hacked or it could glitch and once again, defeat the purpose of the system. ",6,7,0.8387010097503662

Dr. Huang explain how the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, but I think every human has different expressions, or they can hide them pretty well. For example: in a movie you can have a great actor. This actor can make perfect facial expression, as he was really feeling the situation; being truly sad, happy, scared etc. but he is an actor, and this feelings that he is showing for a specific situation on the movie, are not real. Those problems are not happening in his real life.

This actor can hide his emotions, and this software that can predict your emotions won't know that. So I think it's impossible know how people is feeling with just a software that works just by facial expression, because human feelings are more complex that this, and that's why whe have to study human behavior, or how their brains work with different feelings as love. Because humans are more complex than just an expression that you can hide.

In conclusion, sometimes, when people let you see their feelings, this program can work to show you the percents of your facial expression, but is not an accuracy way to do it because behind the human behavior there are more things to think about it if we are talking about feelings, and this may not be always the correct answer to the feelings of a person.

But using the Facial Action Coding System (or FACS) on classroom full with students could be a good/bad idea. One teachers can see if students are confuse or lost, two they see if there's something wrong with one of the students, three some students don't want their's teachers to be in their's problems.

Before I explain more about why it's a good idea for teachers, I want to talk about how i feel about FACS. It something that i never heard about and i think it's somewhat a good idea, but i dont recommaning it to put it in a A.I. It would get a bit weird and creepy if it's in a robot, but that's how i feel about it. Back to the topic, if a teacher is given out a lesson and some students don't get it they use the FACS to see if they get it or don't. They can even use it as they teach and see what they in to work on long until they understand the lessons or topics.

You know how some teachers would ask the class how are they doing before they start the lesson? well there are some teachers who don't ask that but do care for their's students. If they use the FACS before they start class and see someone depress or sad they can wirte their names down on a note or peice of paper and after class or school they talk to them one on one to see whats wrong or if there ok. they can even try to help them or make them feel better.

There are some students who need help or need to talk with someone, but they chose not to get help because they feel like it's gonna make it worst for them. I know some people who really need some help but they dont want to get help, but we had they FACS in my school they get help faster. than again they would get mad with teachers fast becuase they don't teachers to help them with their problems.

Thats what's I got to say about the FACS being a classroom. It would be really helpfull for teachers, but some students would be annoy by it easily or would think that teachers are trying to be apart of there personal lives.",3,7,0.7826665639877319

Sometimes technology makes mistakes too technology is not always right. Can technology actully calculate emotions like math homework? I don't think so because not because they are showing sad emotion it doesn't mean that they are sad. The new technology might sometimes wrong.

Does expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? of course you can tell what emotion what others is showing in the mirror. Can computer tell what emotion does a person is showing by just looking at it of course not. Can technology indicate the difference between a genuine smile and forced one. I don't think computer can detect a fake smile because it didn't say that the new technology can tell if a person is showing fake smile or real smile. whoever thought that making making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion.

To an expert, faces don't lie, these muscular clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. Other people can tell other people faces if they are not being truthful. I know that technology can solve anything but we made them we program them thats why technology can detect our emotions, that means that technology is not the one who is telling our emotion its humans.

Using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not right because this emotion is private for other people. technology should stay away from other peoples business. It's not right for the technologies to just go and detect other students emotion. Students have the right of privacy for their own self. We should not use this technology. For some people they are ashame of their to share their emotion with other people.

Technology should give privacy for the students. Even though Scientist proved that they could detect someone's emotion. We know that technology is important but we have to use it in a right use not using technology just to detect the students emotions. I can tell that mona lisa smile is fake because she didn't show her teeth and she don't have a big smile.       ",3,7,0.8115625381469727
78c07e9,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because we can know how that person is feeling at the time. Would you like to know if a person is feeling sad,happy,bored, or even angry? Of course,not only do we know how they feel but we can also take a step futher on helping them. If a person is depressed we can talk to someone close from them and explain what they are going through, or advice them for that person to take therapy.

The Facial Action Coding System is also a great start to poeple who are new to school or even to sports. If a person feels sad because they arent doing as good as their other teamates, The coach should use the software because it will let him/her know why that person isnt really trying in the sport. Another reason why im for it is because teachers really dont know when you are bored or confused. Especially if you are one of those shy prsons that dont like raising their hand. By using this software teachers can go up to you and explain you with what you are having trouble. If a student is bored with what the what teacher is teaching, she should probably try something new to get the students attention. This technology can also show us when someone has a fake smile for example if you think that you have a friend that really isnt your friend and you talk to her she might be giving you a fake smile because she probably doesnt like you.

The use of this software can determine if you are having problems in your house,the expressions that will show would be sadness and probably anger. In todays world you may be going through a lot but people may not know and they would treat you like garbage. This would then cause you depression and probably then commiting suicide.

Althrough author desrcibes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sytem enables computers to indentify human emotions .Using the articles ,arguing whether the use of this technology read the emotional expression of student in classroom.

When looking at the new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions .This technology is valuable for e the expressions emotion of a students classroom because ,this technology can calculate the emotion of a student .Looking at the article it said,""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face ;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles .Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists ,such as Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise ,anger ,disgust, fear,and sadness-and then associates each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. This technology help calulate each facial muscles that is showed.

Another reason why this technology is valuable to student and classroom because this technolgy can help with what the student is feeling ""For example,if you smile when a Web ad appears on your sreen ,a similar ad might follow .But if you frown,the next as will be different.""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bores ,""Dr. Huang predicts .""Then it could modify the lesson ,like an effective human instructor ""The same technology can make computer -animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery.""Most himan communication is noverbal,including emotion communication,""notes Dr. Huang.""So computers need to understand that,too''.That make this technology useful recongnizing a student behavior

Last this technology can help indentify the different between a genuine smile and a forced one such as a fake smile. In the article is said ,in the real smile , the zygomatic major ,which is the muscles that begin at your cheek bones is lift the corners of your mouth. Also the muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabreaus make crow's-feet around your eyes .In a fake smile is said""But in a false smile,the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a differnt muscle,the risorius .To an expert ,face don't lie; these muscle clues are soemtimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politican or celebrity isn't being truthful.

Everyone experences diffrent things every day no matter what they do. People may always be distgusted by going somewhere or even leaving something valuable for something thats not worth a probably a penny. A lot of people are happy for there own reasons might be seeing the sun shine. Or even hearing birds singing we dont need a computuer for these when we know how to read emotions. A computer desgined to read or emotions on calculate emotions, facial expressions, and impressive calculations no bodody needs a computer to read what we our feeling.

When someone asks if your ok from what they are seeing from your eyes face or acting they try to help they dont calculate emotions for someone. In paragraph 2 ""how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"".

Do we type what makes us sad and a robot answers with a question or something silly or something out of subject for the answer. In paragraph 3 ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"".

If it just looks at the human muscles than theres in issue becuase we could be hurt and not be sad, or something else it could just be we hurt something or just lost a tooth we don't need the calculations to tell us how we feel.

Facial expressions is when we are show if we are happy, sad, angry, and surpirisesd. In paragraph 4 "" emotions are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like smiling broadly)."" Everyone can read peoples expressions unless they just look the same everyday of the week. Therapists are trained for this to see how people are to read to see how they feel if they feel bad or good. In paragraph 4 ""By weighting the diffrent units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)"". The computer might be better for paintings made by people or even a pictures in a book, and games.

We can preform impressive calculations in our lives to help each other everyday. In paragraph 5

""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look non her face."" Not everyone is good at looking at facial expressions or how somone is acting out if someone takes the time to help there friends out or even somebody they can see that they can read emotions well enough without a computer.

The conclusion is we dont need machines helping us with our emotions. If we do we gotten lazy or even just they cant read it or they dont want to read the facial expression on there face. Some of us are glad we can help others for not ourselves without the help of tech we dint need tech in every part of our lives. What we need is people that can help or even want to help us out.

First, the calculations that this computer has made is reflecting on her facial features. Paragraph 1 says, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Tis shows how the computer calculates to her facial features depending on muscle in the face.

Finally, the many ways the computer claculates your facial structure depends on how you feel.

7969ad0,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Some people say that we should have facial recognition in the computers in schools so that if the student looks bored or confused, the computer will change it up a little bit for their liking. It will also be able to help teachers know when a student needs assistance or needs a more energizing lesson. Using this technology in classrooms is valuable because it will help teachers change their actions and might help the student become more engaged.

Schools all over the world would really benefit from the Facial Action Coding System. By using this, there could be a possibility of more engaged students and finally result in higher test scores. Dr. Huang says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Not only will teachers result from this, but students will as well. Just by using the computer system, we will be able to tell how a student is feeling in that classroom or during a certain lesson. If we could see the facial expression, be able to figure out why, and change something to fix it, that would be very effective in the school setting.

Although this would be really great, many people could say that not all students have the same feelings about things so if a teacher changed his or her lesson based on one student, then some of the other students might not be as engaged or delighted. It wouldn't be right to do something based on one student rather than twenty-five. If a few students are very engaged in this lesson and they are paying attention and getting something out of it but other students are confused, if the teacher decides to make a change for the confused students, the students that were engaged in the lesson may become unengaged or bored. That would be the downfall of using this sort of technology.

A very appropriate setting for the Facial Action Coding System would be online schooling and home schooling because both of those are mainly based on the one student taking that course or class. If the camera on the computer sent a signal to the online schooler or home schooler, it would be easy to make a change in the lesson to try and get the student more engaged. Having a student pay more attention and be more engaged in a lesson could actually help raise test scores because if someone was doing something that was actually fun and they could actually retain the knowledge, it might be effective.

Using the Facial Action Coding system in classrooms is valuable and effective. It will help students become more engaged and pay more attention. It will also help raise test scores at least partially because they will be able to remember what they learned when it was something that they liked. While some might have contradictory thoughts, it is mostly a valuable piece of technology that should be used in many schools across the world.   ",5,7,0.887413501739502
79705f2,"Would you be able to tell an emotion of someone just by looking at them? Prof. Thomas Huang thinks so, with the help of his latest invention, the Facial Action Coding System. This is a software that is able to ""read"" emotions of the users, and formulate a new type of lesson to make it more interesting. The Facial Action Coding System is being used to calcuate emotions for promotional, visual, and learning benefits, and for students in the classroom, this technology seems like a plausible idea.

One of the many uses of this coding system is for promotional uses. The artical reads, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different (6)"". This goes to help companies know whether or not you enjoy their product. The software will learn what you like and it will know your emotional preferances towards certain ads. By using this technology, it can recognise if you are pleased, and will give you ads you can enjoy and feel comfortable watching. This use of technology would be useful in the classroom because it would limit the content of ads that are not helpful on computers. When a student sees an ad pop up on their screen, confusion will arise and that will let the sofware know not to play ads like that again. This software will help restrict content and make using the internet more enjoyable for students.

Visually, the software is important to society. An important use of this software can be used during video surgery. The sugery can be seen in more detail and the doctors will be able to percieve emotions clearly. This is not only useful for doctors, but for students as well. By being able to recognise the emotions that people are going through, like pain or fear for example, students who are training to be surgons can watch these videos and take notes on how to improve technique and accuracy. These students will use the technology to recognise flaws and be able to improve upon them. The Facial Action Coding System is useful visually, from video games to video surgery.

While these two aspects are important, one of the main uses for this technology is for learning and growth purposes. ""'A classroom computer could recognise when a student is becoming confused or bored (6)'"", Dr. Huang says. By being able to see when a child is becoming confused with his or her lesson, the computer could adapt the lesson to be more entertaining or effective. This use of the software could be vital in being able to properly equip students with the knowledge they would not have learned well otherwise. The technology could be used almost as a human instructor. The computers are able to understand facial movments and read reactions, which will also show us what the teacher needs to change in the lesson. This software could change the entire education system just because of the ability to read the student's emotions.

The uses of the Facial Action Coding System are uncountable. You can use this to encourage and limit promotions, enhance the visual aspects, and improve learning in the classroom. This software can be used as a guide and as an administrator for students while they are learning new material and surfing the internet. Technology like this is valuble for a student in order to live up to their fullest potential. ",4,7,0.8535621762275696

Using this on humans isn't a good thing. If they want to keep an emotion hidden then I don't think it is a good idea to uncover it. How can the world be a positive place if the happy people who made you happy weren't actually happy. What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy. Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen. Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.

Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great. I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy. It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor but how far would it modify it. Also if this became a thing would it take the place of teachers. If so than that would be a bad thing. So many people would lose their jobs. It says that it would be able to tell if I am confused which is a good thing. That way I wouldn't have to ask the teacher to come help me. They would just know and come help me, but I still think it is a bad idea.

I'm just not sure that it is a good idea to have something that reads emotion. I feel like some things that are better off covered up will be uncovered. Technology will consume our world if we are not careful.",3,7,0.8192431926727295

It seems as if this crucial knowledge will be absent as well as the teacher who is the only one who could both provide the information and make sure it is understood to her students. However, thanks to the technology provided by the Facial Action Coding System, her students will be prepared. An incredibly valuable resource in the classroom, the technology provided by the Facial Action Coding System has the ability to recognize the surprise, anger, and fear, that make up confusion on the faces of children in the classroom and adapt lesson plans and learning objectives that would contribute to an overall increase in performance.

As stated in the article, in response to this recognition of confusion, the computer who is instructing the lesson would change certain aspects of the lesson in an attempt to make them more comprehendable to its audience. A powerful teaching software paired with the Facial Action Coding System would form an adaptive learning program that could compensate for a teacher's lost days due to illness, or a lack of teachers alltogether. The only thing necessary in future classrooms could be supervisors for the students and their smart computers; a place holder for ""an effective human instructor""(Huang). In America alone, many schools face a deficeit of proper teachers capable of teaching specialized subjects. Computers with this adaptive learning software would be capable of more effectivley teaching various subjects due to the many safe sources of information available on the internet. The computer's ability to recognize where an individual may struggle is crucial because it would also be able to recognize what alternative methods were effective in helping the student to understand where a teacher may have formely failed to do so. These specialized learning programs would effectivley cause a general increase of performance in schools across the nation resulting in a more educated group of students prepared for college, and eventually the workplace.

A technology such as the Facial Action Coding System would have a tremendous impact on the work force by reducing the rate of drop out students and increasing the rates of educated students attending colleges. The new generations that have been schooled with this technology will be more likley to find specialized and higher paying jobs, or to discover solutions for local, national, and international issues.

The reason i agree with this new technology is because, well in the passage it says ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly).They use a video imagery, that tracks these facial movement. By weighting the diffenet units, the software can also indentify mixed emotions. So even if the students don't show facial expression, the technolgy can tell how they are feeling, and so the computer can change it up and help the student learn better.

Also the second reason why I agree is because the computer will know when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad migh follow. But if your sad, the next ad will be differnt. Also it can help students learn better, in the passage it says ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" So if a student is confused, the computer will make the lesson more understandable. So the student will learn better and don't need to struggle and will help the teacher.

The third reason why i agree is because the computer can tell if the students are lying about their emotionn. It says in the article ""but in a false smile, the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle"". The computer will spot when a smiling is fake or not.

79d5f4a,"In this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author describes how the FACS enables computers to identify humans emotions, but it isn't that reliable. For instance, you could look as happy as the sun, when the clouds are gone, but be so sad. We rely on technology to do all of these things for us, but computers are not always right. This is a really cool system, but I don't think it's 100% accurate. Some of us will rely on this system to see what their emotions are, but they can't actually tell. There are many advances in this article, that I can't really tell where the disadvantages are.

For example, us humans rely on all this technology when we could just figure it out ourselves. You can't rely on a computer to tell you your exact emotions. It's just like looking something up on the internet, coming to find out that it wasn't the right answer. The internet is not always right, there are many questions, and many wrong answers to those questions. So I don't think that the computer can tell yur emotions. That would be cool, but it wouldn't be right. You could be smiling so hard that your face is about to fall off, and even though it's the fakest smile, the computer would read it as happy.

Secondly, you could be so happy, but look like you're the most depressed person on earth, but the system isn't going to think that. The thing about this system is that we find it so satisfying, because ""oh my gosh, a computer can tell my emotions!?"", but the answer is no. We want to believe it's true, but in real life, I see the happiest people look so sad but they aren't. We see what the computer sees too. We can see what we look like, just like our computer can for this system.

Finally, if we can't tell what we are feeling, how is the computer going to? It's not. In the article, it tells you to look in the mirror, raise your lips at the corners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes. then holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes. After the it asks if the mirror can give you a suggestion of your emotion, or can your partner. Honestly, the answer for that is no, only you know how you're really feeling.

The FACS is not valuable for many reasons. Computers can't tell how you're feeling, nor can anyone else. Also, the internet is not always reliable, which it has gave people wrong answers. You could be so happy, but look like you're just a mess, and the computer wouldn't say you're as happy as you are. ",3,7,0.7527901530265808

But at the point to that technology knows what are your emotions to then use them on ""what you need"" is not correct.

Since we depend so much on technology, its a norm to use it, so mostly everything scientist, inventors and doctors come up with is valuable or useful.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of this new technology the Facial Action Coding System, has worked with many other scientist and doctors to create this technology, that enables computers to identify human emotions. This is a very valuable technology that our world needs today. There are plus and down sides to this argument of the technology being valuable or not. It is valuable because it can be use for many things throughout the world, for example paragraph 6 states, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This technology would help the teacher see what he or she needs to do to be able to make the class more exciting to make students learn and pay attention more. Paragraph 8 states, "" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" The technology would be valuable in a situation like an important election, where if a person running for something is lying about something, you would be able to tell using the help of the FACS.

In conclusion there are many reasons why we should or should not use the Facial Acting Coding System. We depend on technology most of the time, so this would be just another cool addition to our collection of discoveries we already have. Knowing the exact emotion of your mom, dad or friend from a computer software, would be very useful to see if there telling the truth or not.

That he had found out when he was diesecting peapole so that he could find out more. The Computers that he dose with all of these things . The devise all have all of the soft ware on these little electronic codes that help if distiguise between which faces that the person makes when they are happy fear and other.

With having this kind of tech we can do amazing things like figger out who is going to freak out and kill somone or somthing elses that is crazy when peapole go crazy for som odd reasone. This will prpobly save somone life in the long run with this kind of tech that is avalible that we are able to use. With it will give you facial feedback when ever you are using the device that has this program on it that you are able to use with it . these are my reasone for all of theses things.",2,7,0.7794548869132996
7af9f3a,"The Mona Lisa is an old painting. Painted in the 1500s during the Italian rennisance by the renowned artist, mathmetician, and architech Leonardo da Vinci. So what does an old painting have to do with the current age of modern technology and industry, it makes a good test run for a new advacement in computer tech. In this day and age technology has gone leaps and bounds beyond what was possible, such as be able to read and caculate the emotions which could be useful; considering the fact that it works on the face of a painting.

How we caculate the emtions on a face is rather simple when we are given the six base emtions. A base of six emtions is good to work with and the author states that ,""Eckman has classified six basic emotions—happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness—and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(D'alto 3). From these six emtions and reading the facial expressions we can caculate out of one hundred percent the level of emtion. It feels odd to put emotions on a scale if 1 to 100 as it raise the philisophical question if emtions can be quantified. The more interesting question is how can this computer software read mixed emtions on the face, and with that question in mind Dr Huang gives us this answer ,""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci’s masterpiece)""(D'alto 4). With this computer being able to read mixed emotions and caculate a number from there is a marvel. It does bear a question. What must the computer see tomread these emtions. Where does this idea that we can read emotions stem from in relatin to this advancement in science.

The key that opens the gate to reading emotions isnt hard to find as regular people do it everyday. In the article the author says that humans do the same caculations as the computer everyday, and then provides us with this ,""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face""(D'alto 5). Most days one can look to their friend and family and see something there. When a mother smiles at her children and her children smile back it is obvious that they are happy. The same is also true when a son and father argue, as when one is angry the other is bound to follow. Humans are emotional creatures and our emotions can and often drive the emotions of others. What da Vinci did to impress people through his art was that he captured emotion, it can be hard to translate emotion of life to canvas however ,""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions""(D'alto 5). art in all forms is expression and the Mona Lisa is an expression of the emotions of a lady capture too last &or a long time. The fact that the computer can read and detect emotion in such an old painting is amazing but it does allow one to think in doubt of this new technology. What happens if someone is faking emotion to get by.

Insuarance of success is nice and the doctors who havemspent time and hard work want to be as efficent as possible, so it makes sense they are confidant in their software to read real and fake emotion. The doctors explain that the computer reads muscle movement, and what these movements do is ,""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(D'alto 7). If this is true then the efficency must be incredibly acurate. The movement of muscles in genuine emotions must be relaxed and not forced like in fake smiles. This forced smile tense the muscles in a way that makes them look different to the computer. Truly facsinating as even humans could use this recongnition in small ways. The best utilization of this is pointed out when the author says ,""To an expert, faces don’t lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a “smiling” politician or celebrity isn’t being truthful""(D'alto 8). This is rather scary in though and yet intriguing in its own right. When people put up false fronts one has to ask why should i trust this person. A better question raised is what does this mean for people going forward.

Overall else this technology is intriguing and ciuld be useful to people. It could find use in court to tell if a suspect is faking emtions, it could lead to identify false fronts of politician. The uses for technology that advances foward like this, is that there is no limit to what can be done but imgination. Useful, intriuging, and slightly scary, the expectations place on this device will be something for many to look foward to.",4,7,0.6730800271034241

While teachers search for helpful methods to engage their pupils in education, the world of science develops more and more inventions, such as the Facial Action Coding System, to improve standards of living. Despite its putative effectiveness in other fields such as advertisement or marketing, Facial Action Coding System technology possesses no place of value in a classroom and would serve as a hinderence to a student's learning process.

Although this software may serve as an effective source of profit for online corporations, it has no valueable place in classrooms. In the sixth paragraph of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6). While this software may be helpfully applicable to marketing schemes, its analyzation of human emotions would only deter from a student's learning in the classroom due to its possible misinterpretations and miscalculations. Verbal human communication is relied upon to determine what about a lesson plan confuses a student, and although a computer might register a student's confused expression and recognize that the lesson pace might be too fast for this individual scholar, the computer would be unable to pinpoint what exactly the student fails to understand. Other events may be weighing down heavily on a student's mind, causing their face to contort and convey the emotions brought on from factors outside of the learning setting. A change in emotion not caused by a difficult lesson plan would cause the software to possibly alter the lesson pace when the student did not require any adjustment and ultimately generate frustration in the already distressed student.

Although each day, more and more opportunities to develop and improve technology and learning are created, sometimes these brilliant innovations do not mesh well with education. Despite the proposed effectiveness this software can serve for marketing companies, Facial Action Coding System would only produce obstacles to a student's learning process, ultimately diminishing any value it could potentially possess in a classroom.",5,7,0.8239898085594177
7b7bb8c,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is very useful to a classroom computer, it would help make the students interested to learn about the subject they are learning about. The article talks about how the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) acually works, by someone showing an emotion in front of the computer, the computer can track your facial structure by your facial muscles.

In paragraph 1, the article is talking about how Mona Lisa cually feels in the picture becacuse it shows that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. In paragraph 4, the article is talking about how the computer is using video imagery, as a way of telling how you would feel, as if your smiling but not as broad as someone would if they were acually happy. In paragraph 6, the computer could track your facial structure to see your emotion on what your mood would be, by giving the situation of when a student saw an ad on his computer, if he were to smile then the next ad that pops up would be similar, but if a ad popped up and you would frown then the next ad that would pop up would be different. it would help in a classroom by seeing if the student is enjoying the subject they are learning about, because if someone likes somthing they would become more involved in the subject, if a teacher is trying to see what the students were interested in, the computer would be able to track the true emotion of a student. instead of a student acting like he likes it or faking to speed things up in the lesson or getting it over with, the computer would still track the person's true emotion by seeing in the emotion is too broad. even if the computer would cost too much or if it wouldn't be vlauable enough to instal it on every computer it would be worth it to keep the students entertained and paying close attention on the lesson.",2,7,0.7660430073738098
7b7e5ba,"using facial expresions are a good way to tell someone u are mad or happy. but sometimes u cant tell the diffrence unless people smile all the time. for instince when i walk i have a mean face that dosent mean im mad i could be happy but its just how my face is. u shouldnt need technology to tell someone if your happy ot sad all they gotta do is look at your face and they should already know if your mad or sad.

if the person isnt sure they should ask and see wether if your mad or sad. mona lisa smiling is just showing that shes happy or that she was happy while taking the picture. to be honest i think u can smile and feel something other than happiness. like when someone is mad and they smile just to seem like there happy.

i really dont get how u can calculate emotions like its an emoiton not a math question u either ask if the person is mad or sad or u just guess off the facial expressions. thats how i see it in my eyes itll be much easier to just ask then to do reasurch.

i think the smile should be used to show happiness people can be happy for just a moment then change there face which i understand i do it all the time. mad face should show if your mad. sad face should show that your sad. it shouldnt have to involve technology to find out how the person feels. mona lisa is a wonderful painting but i think she was happy in the picture because she smiled.",2,7,0.7292159795761108
7bbbdc7,"The Facial Action Coding System will not work, because it can only understand six basic emotions, when their are much more. It can only understand happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saness. It doesn't understand regret,passion, and hungar. It does not have sempathy, so it will be hard for the Facial Action Coding System to help the stundent with the promblem it detects. The Facial Action Coding System won't understand why the stundent will need to leave to use the restroom. And it won't understand why the stundent act out on emotion. Or what the emotion can make then do.

Yes the Facial Action Coding System can dect basic emotions by looking at the facial musles, but their are so many more emotion beyound that. The Facial action Coding System has no teaching ability. Nor does it under how teach and explain thing in a simple way. It does not know how to expain things to the younger stundents how don't understand things. The Facial Action Coding System is a fantasic idea, but it has a far way to go before it teaches any stundents. ",2,7,0.7728894948959351
7bccaa9,"Technology can not tell you about someones emotions. The closest thing that is the lie detector test and not even that is 100 percent correct because it is very easy to beat the system just by slowing down your breathing or tricking your mind into thinking your right. Same thing with this ""Facial Action Coding System"", if you smile in a picture but your really actually sad then this system will most likely think your happy from the smile. Not even people can tell someone how they feel because the only one who truly knows how you feel is you. Obviously technology is right somewhat most of the time but this system doesnt seem like it would be anywhere near possible. There would be ways to make this test better though, like when you use a lie detector they put sensors on your pulses, So maybe if you used the same thing on this test it would give it a somewhat more realistic calculation. Over time this system will most likely get better but at the state its in now, it doesnt seem very reliable.

In paragraph 5 it states that,""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by look on her face"". You can also tell how a person is feeling by their body language. If their head is down you might think they feel sick,tired, or they might not want to talk to anyone. It is east to tell when someone it feeling happy because when they are happy they stand up straight,have a smile on their face. A person's attitude can tell a lot about someone. For example if you can their name and the answer ""what!"" it can mean they are annoyed by someone or something. Another example can be when you're talking to someone and they answer you with no emotion on their face,and they slumped down in a chair can mean they are either tired and don't have any engery to do anything and maybe want some time to themselves.

My other reason why I disagree is that FACS might cost the school a lot of money. Instead of buying this technology why not buy more books or take field trips. Why buy something that might be used once rather than save the money and use it for soemthing good. Like buying better computer for the school or buying materials for the classes. If a student isn't paying attention instead of modifying the lesson like it states in paragraph 6. Why wont the teacher help the student after school instead of changing the lesson. It would help the student understand more and help him.",3,7,0.6743854284286499

Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you're surpised your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lip to show anger. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. They would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc.

Computers know when your happy or sad if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow but if you frown the next ad will be different. Most human communication is nonverbal inculding emotional communication so computers need to know that to. You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. A computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.

According to the facial feedback theory of Emotion moving your facial emotions, but also may even help produce them. Putting on a happy face actually works a renowned drama coach had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.

Modifying animations, making us happier, and surfing the web are all results to the new update. Way more people would enjoy interacting with the media. It could change the way we live our day to day life using technology.

When video games just came out, you could barely see the facial expressions of any of the charcters. As time evoled, we started to update how 3D features were in the game. With this technology, they could make computer- animated faces even more expressive. This involves updating video games or video surgery. When we can see more of the features, it starts to feel more like real life.

Our facial expressions speak louder then our words. Using muscles like orbicularis oculi, zygomatic major, and risorius we can create a smiling face. In fact if you see yourself smile or someone makes you smile, it can make you happy. While seeing someone else's facial expressions can make us imitate that person and have empathy for them. Facial expressions can change a lot for humans.

Just while you are on facebook or any social media, the coding system is watching you. If you smile at an ad that appears on your screen, the next ad you see may also catch your eye. This technology is making sure we do not get bored while surfing the web. If you frown or look confused, the system will recognize it and change the next topic to something that interest you. We all know we use some type of social media and find something we do not like.

The Facial Action Coding System is an amazing update. Seeing someone's facial expressions making me happier, modifying animations, and changing unwanted ads are all great factors of the new technology. As most of the world uses technology, this is what we need to keep it going. Everyone likes an evolving world and likes a new change. It is amazing how the 44 major muscles in our faces can run how our technology is.",3,7,0.7630717754364014

It had been created a new software to develop the knowledge of the emotions of others. Although, new applications of thisgeneration can calculate math homework. The Monalisa has been used for this discovery,

Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of FACS, also they uses a computer to created 3-D model of the face basics emotions.

First, the author describe how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions by a computer. This portrays that the technology has been update to let people have more knowledge about this new era. The Monalisa has been used for this discovery. The text says"" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This show us that by just looking at their face we can't notice all this emotions on this paint of Leonardo da Vinci's.

Second, the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions just by looking at their normal face. This shows how the technology have been update upon all this year, every year that pass, more discovery are treaten at the world. Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of the FACS. The text says "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happines, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" This means that the new discovery of Dr. Paul Eckman can identify 6 basic emotions.

Third, the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions by showing people thier emotion in only one picture of them. This new technology shows how people can have their knowlegde in this topic withot being an expert. To do this discovery they uses computer to created a 3-D model of the face basics emotions. The text says "" The process begins when the computer construcs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This means that all the 6 emotions are associated with each charactheristic movements of the facil muscles.

With all the technology that we now have available, it is easier than ever to learn things, and with newer technology coming out it is only becoming easier. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it helps educators, allows students to learn better, and keeps students engaged.

This technology could be very valuable and helpful for educators. Educators have a very important job. They are building the future for society, which can be very hard. Teachers have to deal with many students, and every student is different. With the use of the Facial Action Coding System, teachers don't have to worry about a teaching method that will not work with all students. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system recognizes if a student is confused, and alters the lesson to better fit the student. This allows educators to not worry about finding a teaching method that suites every student. This technology also helps out educators, because it works one on one with students. It's made to help every student individually by reading the student's facial expressions. As student's learning patterns may change, the system changes with the student. The use of this technology will also be helpful for teachers because educators can take a look and see what teaching methods work the best with students overall. In the article it says the system can detect when students are confused and bored, so educators can use this technology to see what doesn't make students feel confused nor bored. This technology could be very valuable and helpful for educators.

The Facial Action Coding system is valuable because it allows students to remain engaged. In the article,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it describes how the system can regognize how a student is feeling. The lesson changes depending on how the system reads the student's reaction. The system can read when a student is bored and change up the lesson. This is essential because it allows students to be more engaged in learning, since it will no longer be as boring as it was for them. The system may also help students to remain engaged in learning because nobody would be learning something the same exact way. In the article it says that lessons are modified to fit every student using facial recognition, so students would be learning in a way that suites them personally. This technology also keeps students more engaged because they would feel happier, because the system tries to keep students engaged and happy. In the article it says that the system can ready when people are unhappy, so the system would try to prevent students from feeling that way about learning. The system could really help students be more excited about learning.

Using the Facial Action Coding System to read the emtional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it allows students to learn better. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system could ""modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". All students would be able to get helped individually, one on one with the system. The system also allows students to learn better because everyone learns things differently, and the system would be able to adjust for every student's learning style. In the article it says that the system can detect if a student is confused, so the system would be very valuable in classrooms because it would make sure that students are not confused. The system would make sure that students are actuallly comprehending the material.

The Facial Action Coding system could be very valuable in classrooms. It has many benefits to both students and educators. It would allow students to remain engaged, learn better, and it would also help educators, A system like this could really allow all students to reach their full potential.",5,7,0.8496231436729431
7c87818,"Growing up in a constantly changing environment, students have had to learn to adapt to the world around them. In school, students are taught to be open and ready to learn, while still facing the ups and downs in the journey of childhood to adulthood. Students make close bonds with their friends and even a few choice teachers. Students choose to whom they share their emotions with and at what time they wish to do so. Emplimenting a computer system in schools that is capable of reading a students emotions is inappropriate, lazy, and dangerous.

This technology is incredible. It's capable of easily figuring out what someone feels right when they're feeling it. Empathy is an intimate ability one experiences with another. Most people have the ability to sense others emotions, ""For instance, you can probably telll how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" There is a prominent understanding in the natural world regarding emotions. Sometimes not every one wants to be figured out and displayed to their peers. In school, students are faced with one major task: to learn. Teachers are faced with the task of teaching. A teacher's job is to engage students and the students job is to stay engaged with the teacher. Emplementing facial reading teachnology is innappropriate and dangerous to the privacy of students, and it threatens the basic principles school systems were founded upon. Teachers and students have major jobs to do at schools and this technology might distracted from the main goals of schooling. Students want to be cared about and valued but not by everyone or at any time a computer chooses. Students may feel uncomforatble if teachers ask how they're feeling. A student has friends and family to confide in, and may not want everyone to know the personal and private issues they are going through. If students emotions are displayed to their peers and teachers, they might feel awkward opening up, because they aren't comfortable around them.

Furthermore, this technology could be used in the wrong situations. The article stated that a smart school computer could tell when students are getting bored or confused and change the lesson, ""' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This example puts teachers in an awkward position. Letting a smart, facial reading technology teach students would mean the teachers aren't teaching. Giving power to technology is complacent, instead of working with people to improve learning habits or teaching methods, adults would be taking the easy way out. This technology had the purpose of connecting humans in focus but instead it will further divide them. Students don't want to be analyzed by computer systems; they want to be cared about by other humans. If the goal is to focus on students emotions, adults should take some time out of the day to talk face to face, instead of sticking the child in front of a computer monitor.

Some might argue that these computers might be a useful tool for counselors in schools. This is a valid argument, but this also compromises the position of school counselors. Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection.

The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection.

7ca7bfa,"Often times I go to seventh period looking at my classmates and see only blank expressions. Like me, they're tired after an enitire day. It is difficult to tell how they are feeling and what are they thinking. I am positive that my teacher struggles with the same issues. She often says things simiilar to ""Use the next 30 minutes to get 2 or 3 problems done"". I don't blame her for the class's lack of enthusiasm. But now shift to the middle of the day, where people have the most energy. Mixed emotions appear, as well as mixed facial expressions. How can a teacher effectively teach if he/she is unclear what students are thinking? In Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", D'Alto discusses using technological advancements in facial recognition to detect exactly how people are feeling. If a classroom uses technologically assisted facial recognition, one would see the following three benefits to a learning environment: more focused education, increased collaboration with students, and creating a safer learning environment.

In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", D'Alto' cites Dr. Thomas Huang, a professor at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" In the first case where a student becomes confused, the teacher now knows what concepts the student is struggling with. This is a major advantage to the traditional school setting. In many of my past experiences helping fellow students, I have found it beneficial to know more about the student. I could relate better to the student, and better predict what could be a possible weakness. With a computer more accurately assting the teacher, the teacher can better address the weaknesses of the class or student. Since the primary goal of the educator is to educate to prepare students for the future, a computer assisted classroom would benefit the teacher in spotting weaknesses. In the latter example where the student becomes bored, a computer would spot a student who is not paying attention. The teacher, who often teaches a class of over 20 students cannot detect a bored face as easily. By focusing on a student who has mentally shut down, the teacher could potentially take disciplinary action, or quickly wake up the student such that the student misses less material that was taught. In both cases, a computer assisted classroom would bring a more focused education to students.

Dr. Huang goes on to predict that the computer ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would relate back to the first example made. By creating a more focused curriculum, teachers can collaborate better with students. It is rarely possible, perhaps even impossible, to teach a class without proper collaboration and communication between teacher and student. By collaborating with students on a more individualized level, the student receives help and education directed at his/her needs. I look back at my personal experiences, where I have needed help on one particular topic. For example, there was a point in my AP Physics class that I needed a detailed explanation of a topic, and I stayed after class to talk with my teacher specifically. Such a computer assisted classroom could help teachers and students alike receive better collaboration, further leading to a better education.

Finally, it is necessary to note the main point of D'Alto's work. His main argument is that computers can help understand the way humans feel. Additionally, a computer can carry out raw calculations millions of times faster than humans can. With the recent events involving gun violence in Ohio, Kentucky, and Florida, it is critical to ensure the safety of the students. At my school, staff now glance over each student entering the building, looking for possible weapons. If a computer assisted school patrolled the doors looking for signs of anxiety, anger, depression, or any emotion that may show signs of intent to harm, a faster response could be delivered before any event occurs. For a long duration of time, the Columbine shooters had displayed emotions of intent to harm. If Columbine High School was assisted with this type of computer technology, perhaps the threats would have been neutralized before fifteen lives were lost. With the help of a speedy computer scanning through hundreds of emotions every day, it would better protect students attending that school. This would contribute to a safer learning environment for students, which further presses the need for this technology in schools, especially in today's society.

To wrap things up, it ought to be clear that this new facial recognition technology has many benefits to schools. Perhaps the only disadvantage would be the cost; however the benefits clearly outweigh the cost. Nick D'Alto's article discussed the techniques of using such a technology, and these techniques benefit the school setting greatly. After analyzing the examples presented, such technology used in schools would provide more focused education, increased collaboration with students, and a safer learning environment, all of which are advantage to schools seeking to provide the best education for the future generation.",5,7,0.7671713829040527
7cc058f,"Using a computer to identify human emotions sounds good and bad. It sounds like it can be good in a way like if a friend was having a bad day and we didn't know what was wrong with them, we could then use a computer to help us. It can also be bad because what if a person doesn't feel like talking about a certain subject, using a computer to detect that humans emotion is unfair to that person, invading their private thoughts.

Im gonna support my claim and say it is not a valuable use of technology in my opinion. The use of the Facial Action Coding System sounds like an invade on someones deep thoughts and ideas that the person might not want anyone else to know. In my eyes a person's personal thoughts are very, very private if they want them to be. If we feel a certain way and we dont want to say it, that system totally invades the privacy of others. Again, in my eyes that is not right.

An example from the excerpt was detecting if we can see if a human is faking a smile or not. I get it, it would be outstanding to read everyones emotions, but at the end of the day its about what that person that is feelng a certain way feels about expressiong their emotion or not. If a human were to force a fake laugh and a computer shown that that was indeed a fake laugh, it would make the person who thought they were really laughing feel stupid, or upset. I am not saying lying is good, but sometimes its best to fake a smile for a better outcome of any situation.

As humans, making others feel good, or be happy is something we all try to do for others at one point. If we allow the Facial Action Coding System to enable a computer to tell our true emotions we may not be able to make a person feel good or happy. Lying is bad yes, but when it comes to making a person feek good about their apperence it is good to make them feel better about themselves. Like i stated before, Lying isnt always a bad thing.

In conclusion, i do not support nor do i agree with the Facial Action Coding System for any use at all. In my eyes telling someone they are beautiful, even if you dont mean it can make that persons day so much better. At the end of the day that is all it is about, making someone happy. With this technology it would be invading all human principles and person space. If a person does not want to talk about a certain topic, that is perfectly okay, drop it. Using that software in our computers to decet how they are feeling in my eyes is totally not okay. With that i close out my statement with no, usuing this technology in a classroom is not valuable, at all.",4,7,0.8310263156890869
7cc875a,"The world of technology is changing everyday thanks to scientist around the world. These scientist create new ways of live and helping. Scientist have now created a technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" which enables people to find out what emotions others have. People are debating on whether or not we shout use this facial system and I believe we should, here are my reasons on why.

""The facial expresions for each emotion are universal,"" according to professor Dr. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute. What he mean is that there are a lot of emotions in this world and several expressions can be used for the same emotion. If we're using the same expression for several different emotions how will we know how someone feels. With the new emotio software we can tell what emotions or mixed emotions someone has. This would be helpful in a classroom because ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."" If a computer can recognize that then it could help can the lesson into something more effective for students. Some students aren't going to come right out and admit they're bored or confused, they sit in the chairs the whole class period not admitting to either of those emotions. If we had computers that can recognize emotions then there would be no students sitting in class dumbfounded or bored out of their minds.

There has been many times where students zoned out because they were too bored to pay attention to the teacher. Not many teachers can tell when a student is bored unless they zone out of a disscusion or presentation. So if we had facial systems then we could have a computer readjust the disscusion to make it more entertain. We could also find out if someone is bored or confused ourselves by if there's a fake sideways smile or if our ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises our eyebrows (paragraph two)"", showing our confusion.

The world could make a difference in the classroom if we got the ""Facial Action Coding System"" in all classrooms. No more confused students, no more being bored. This is why I believe having facial reading technology in the classroom would be of value for many people. ",3,7,0.898868978023529
7ccba59,"I am for the value of using this technology to read people emotional expressions. A few reasons I am for this experiment is because you can see how people feelings are, if a person has a hard time showing/ expressing their emotions to others, and see how others feel about you or another person.

This experiment can contructn a 3D facial model on a computer and pop right out and see how that person is feeling. The computer can classifiy the six basic expressions on a person, such as happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. Scienctist did a lab experiment on the famous Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona Lisa. The experiment was to see if Mona was trying to smile or if she was being serious, so they experimented to see her expressions.

The technology associates with facial movements and mussles, that the computer can detected a false smile and a netural expression. The technology of the computer can detect if a person has a real smile or a forced smile on their face. A way to see if a person is forcing their smile is by looking at the sides of their mouth because the smile is stretched on the sides of your mouth using a different mussle, the risorius.

The theory of the experiment is not only tp show and figure out you expressions/ emotions but it can also help you with producing them. The whole story is talking about showing the emotions of your peers.",2,7,0.8354213833808899
7cef27a,"I strongly believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because teachers never know when their students are feeling down. Also, some students can't talk about their feelings or express them because they are afraid other will make fun of them, and or they don't have anybody that they can trust. If this technology really works maybe it will help with communication and helping others being able speak up, and tell adults what's on their mind.

In the article is says that ""mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" , and this shows that this technology could really tell how you are feeling. It can also tell you when you are faking a smile, and when you are really meaning it. In the article it also says that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", which to me means that you can't change the way your face expressions your emotions. When someone's face changes thats when you know how they are feeling, by the way they look.

To sum it all up, I believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Not everybody can be confident enough, and some can't trust others with their feelings, because they always end up getting hurt, nobody really ever cares about how you feel, and some people just want to know what is going on to make fun of you, and or hurt you.

7cf67d3,"When a student is confused in school they are supposed to raise their hand. It's been taught that way since day one. Whether that is followed or not is hard to say. Some students are scared to raise their hand however, as they grow older and mature, they seem to find more courage to ask questions which is the way it has always been taught. Students generally make faces when they are confused, that can be beneficial to the teacher if they're paying attention. A recent computer software has been developed by Professor Thomas Haung that indicates peoples emotions. It was used on the Mona Lisa to get every percent of each emotion on her face. It was suggested that this software be put in schools to benefit students. However, this innovation should not be put into schools because of the varying ages of kids, how much it would actually be used, and the convienence of the schools budget and space in the classrooms.

This computer software that can tell every percent of what emotion on your face is a very fascinating concept but is not the most convienent for pre-school and elementary students. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it was said a classroom computer could recognize confusion or boredom from the students and then in which change the lesson for a more beneficial class (para 6). If this were to be put in place into an younger classroom it could be misleading. Younger kids have spunky behavior as their minds are still maturing and developing. They might find the software fun and amusing and make many facial expressions which would alter their lesson plan in class unaccordingly. Others may argue that little kids could possibly get bored of doing that every day and eventually calm down about it so then it would be useful. Though you never know when a little kid could find something fun again, it's just that easy and would then again rise to misleading lesson plans for the young students.

If this technology was put in a highschool classroom where students minds have better matured and developed it would be more successful. However, there would need to be a computer for every student and not all schools can provide that.

Some students may even find it uncomfortbale to have their expressions and themselves being watched and analyzed all day. As a result of knowing they are being recognized as confused, they could easily act and prevent their expression from giving that result or not even use them. People can already do the work of this software, friends can tell how you're feeling based on your facial expression (para 5). Also mentioned in ""Making Mono Lisa Smile"" people use their knowledge to tell whether a politician or celebrity is faking a smile or being truthful (para 8), again proving that people can already do what this software is, just not as precise with numbers. On the other hand, if these computers were installed in schools and became a regular thing, then it could eventually be excepted by students and they would actually use the software to their benefit.

Teachers would find this innovation helpful. They could argue that not all students express if they trully understand material or not. If they had this software it would accurately show them the truth about their students. But students could still refuse to use it which would lead teachers back to square one.

Maybe even before a students first day of school they were taught to raise their hand if they had something to say, it's normal. So let students do that because the computer software that tells every percent of every expression someone is having is unecessary to have in a school because of the varying ages of kids, how much it would actually be used, and the convienence of the schools budget and space in the classrooms.",6,7,0.8367166519165039

How this device works is that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, then studys all 44 major muscles. Moving one or more mucsles is called an action unit. After that Dr. Huang relies on Dr. Pual Eckman, the creator of FACS to find out how the preson is feeling.

The FACS software can track facial movements even if your not smiling as broadly. Just when you think that is all it can do it can also identify mixed emotions each exspession is compared to a nertarl face showing on emotion.

7d34dd4,"How could a computer seeing one's face detect someone's emotion and be accurate? The use the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is the answer.

The author uses the picture of Mona Lisa as an example.

In paragraph one, the author states, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" (D' Alto par 1).

Dr. Huang explains how the process begins when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face, including all the major musclues in the model that must move like human muscles.

The author then states, ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" (D' Alto par. 1).

Explaing how the different movement your muscles make can show the different emotions.

The different emotions kids make doing class will be precisely accurate.

However, in a classroom your emotions might vary differently.

A student can look happy one moment and then look bored the next even though they are still happy.

Dr. Huang explains how the facial expressions for each emotion are universal; meaning they can vary.

That is why using video imagery will capture the mixed emotions.

In paragraph four, the author states,""... the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" (D'Alto par 4).

Therefore if your emotions are continously changing in class, this software can detect.

Having this in the classrooms will be more effective toward the teachers and students. The teacher will know when they have to modify their lesson when the kids are bored.

Without this, teachers go on about a topic without doing something interesting to keep the students more alive. This software helps the kids, because if they are bored by a teacher teaching, then what will they learn?

Having this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is both valuable and useful. Valuable in terms, that it will be accurate in helping teachers modify their way of teaching if needed. Useful in terms, that it will help students be more lively in the lesson.

Who would think the faces students made in class can now be detected by their own teacher?                    ",3,7,0.8860059976577759

""Oh it's nothing."" replies Charlie who's obviously not as happy as he always is. Thomas would sure like to know how is friend is feeling; but he can't because there's no humanly way possible to if Charlie doesn't want him to know right? Well actually he can. There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. Like in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kid's attention. Another effective was it could be used would be for it to show how some kids are feeling to limit them getting into any kinds of trouble. And finally it could be used to detect if one student just isn't grasping the matter of the subject that everyone else is getting with no problem. There are endless ways this technology could be used to better a classroom and this technology should be used in a classroom with students.

In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" In the sense that kids often time get bored in class, hence the reason they have a bad grade or get in trouble in that class, something has to change. Maybe it's the child's fault, but your traditional lesson isn't the most fun. If the instructor could find out what's boring the child and change the lesson to keep the child entertained then maybe the child wouldn't get into so much trouble with that teacher or maybe the child's grade in the class would take a huge leap. Who says learning can't be fun? With FACS learning could be something kids like to do.

In addition to keeping everyone awake, FACS could be used to keep people who aren't feeling too good get better. Everyone deals with things that others probably don't know about. With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him. If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down. That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that.

Finally, everyone knows that all children learn at their own speed. FACS could be used to find out whose stuck on someting that everyone is flying through.

When the teacher is teaching something that everyone but one student understands and the teacher stops for questions, that one student may feel too embarrassed to ask a question so the lesson would go on and only get more difficult as time goes by. Instead of that happening, FACS would let the teacher know what kid that is so that the teacher could reach out to the kid and give them extra practice or even a little tutoring if they need it, that could really be a huge help to children that don't learn as fast as others. Usong FACS to determine that could really translate for the great or good of the grades of students everywhere.

In order to make the classroom a more happy place, a better place, FACS should be used with students. FACS could detect bordem so that no kid is bored enough to drift into space or sleep and miss valuable work time. FACS would be good for keeping kids that are dealing with things away from people that'll trigger them. Also FACS can be used to show weather or not children have questions and need help but are embarrassed to say so.

What if teachers could tell how your feeling? With this new software that is out, they could possibly do that. The software is called the Facial Action Coding System, and it could tell you what your feeling at that point of time. In my opinion, if teachers had these it would not be a terrific thing. Having them constantly knowing your emotions is not a good thing at all, and could make them mad, or make them very happy. In this essay, ill tell you about why I am against this device being in schools.

Everybody has been bored in a class before, its compleatly normal, but its in a way the teacher cant see it. Students probably would not like having their teacher use the software on them, to then have the teacher mad at them for being bored, or to have the teacher worried there not doing something right. In paragraph 3 it explains that the Facial Action Coding System begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, which will include all 44 major muscles, so they can see how your feeling. It can classify 6 diffrent emotions, such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. I think that your emotions are your emotions, and that if you are feeling down or sad, that you can tell someone, not have it put down on a screen.

This tool wouldn't be that valuable in school beause we are already surviving without it. You could just tell emotions from looking at a persons face, as stated in paragraph 5, and you could just ask them what is wrong. I dont think you should use that type of technology on the students in a highschool or elementry school because it. Using this on a class of highschool students could come out with a whole lot of responces because students in highschool feel alot. I know I woudnt want to have my emotions checked on a screen. It just doesnt sound right to me.

The Facial Action Coding System is a wonderful idea, you can see peoples emotions, which is really brilliant, but I just dont think it would be good in classrooms. It could have the teacher know if your bored, if your sad, mad, or in disgust, which as a student, I know I wouldnt want my teacher to know that information about me. This device showed the gloomy looking Mona Lisa was feeling, which is tramendous, but I dont think it would be a good idea for students in a class room.        ",4,7,0.8548856377601624
7e89431,"Do you think technology can read your emotion? In my opinion I believe technology can't read your emotion. First of all, emotion has to do with what you're thinking about, a face can lie, and a drawing doesn't always mean it's happy when there is dark around it.

First of all, when you try to see someone's emotion you don't really pay attention to their face you pay attention to how they act and how they talk. Someone can be hyper and talkative some days and the next they can be smiling but not hyper or talking to anybody. Kids come to school and put on a happy face when actually they don't want to be there. It's the same with everything else.

Secondly, a face can lie. Everyone has something they're thinking about but nobody knows exactly what they're thinking about. Everyone hides their emotion a certain time in life; therefore, you can easily smile but it doesn't mean you're happy.

Lastly, in the story the author talks about how they can also use the new technology they made to know the emotion of drawings like Mona Lisa. When you look at the picture of Mona Lisa you see her smiling but the picture has to color and the smile does not look like a real smile, it looks like a fake smile. Also, in the picture of Mona Lisa the background is of a lonely lake or pond which is also without color. Color shows alot of emotion depending on the colors you use, like dark colors determine sadness and bright colors determine happiness but red is in between and usually determines hate; someone being angry.

In conclusion, technology can not read emotions. Emotion has to do with what is going on in your mind, facial expressions can easily lie, and emotion in drawings determine the colors of the the art.   ",3,7,0.800489604473114

There are few good reasons why the system could be benificial to a classroom. since it can caculate all 44 majormuslces like the Lateralis or the orbicularis oris. It can get students who are depressed or being bullied help they need instead of waiting around for them to get help themselves. Another good reason why its benificial for the system could be in a classroom is that it can show if a student is confused on a question or problem and dont like getting help from a teacher the scanner can spot them and see if they can get help.

people will hate the facial action codeing system because they wont like people intruding on their feelings even when they are hiding them for a reason. the system can be scary to many people because it could offspring other systems like reading your mind for say. it could be hated for the fact that people dont like talking about their emotional feelings to strangers and the system just sucks their expressions off their face and detects their feelings upsets many people.

The Facial Action Coding System is a perfect system if you wanted to know one's feelings or just to have your computer know what your feeling and understand that maybe some day it can help you with your emotional problems.   ",3,7,0.8023973703384399
7ea777f,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" we are talking about how Professor Thomas Huang just came out with the Facial Action Coding System. It is supposed to be able to detect exactly how other people are feeling. Even if they are trying to hide their emotions it can still know how people are feeling. It is the latest innovation at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of

Illinois. He was working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Seve of the University of Amsterdam.

I am all for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. All it does is beginnig with the computer construction a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, who is the creator of the Facial Action Coding System. He has classified six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. When you raise your eyebrows you are surprised and when you tighten your lips you show anger. This will really help us show how different people are feeling. If they are doing something for school such as a lesson on a computer and the way it is being done is making them bored or tired then it will be able to tell us and it can change the way the lesson is being taught so that they will become more interested. If you raise your lips to the corners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes. The emotion that you are doing is that your face looks happy. If we have this then we will be able to feel someone else's emotioinal state because wer unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.

In conclusion Dr. Huang made the Facial Action Coding System. It can help us tell how others are feeling and tell if they are trying to hide their emotions. It can help us when we get bored when we are on our computers doing things for school. It can help make things more interesting so that we don't fall asleep or stop doing what we need to do. It can also help us feel someone else's emotional state because we unconscioiusly imitate another person's facial expressions.",2,7,0.8894301652908325
7f41025,"Have you ever wondered how someone is feeling emotionally? Do you want to know if they are feeling sad or angry, even if they are smiling? Well according to Professeur Thomas Huang of the Beckman Instutute for Advanced Science, he believes that we can detect human's emotions by a 3-D computer model of the face by observing all of their 44 major muscles. Still, can a computer really be able to detect human emotions just by looking at muscles. I believe that this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System might not be what can actually detect human emotion.

Throughout the article, Dr. Huang refers to muscles for emotions so they can observe how a person is feeling. He states that your ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're suprised"" (para. 3). He also relates the orbicularis oris that ""tightens your lips to show anger"" (para.3). What he is saying could be true but people have the ability to control their own expressions, so if someone perfoms one of those expressions, what if they aren't feeling the way they might express?

Another example Dr. Huang uses is the painting of ""Mona Lisa"". The article states that ""according to some new computer software that could recognize emotions"" (para.1). In the article the introduction asks if the intended reader can imagine detecting how people are feeling, ""even when they are trying to hide their emotions"" (intro para.). Throughout the begining of the article they talk about what if you could dectect someone without even knowing how they are feeling, but as the article progresses, they mostly talk about certain muscles that move when you make a facial expression.

So which one is it? Can we actually detect someones emotions even if they are expressing an emotion, or can we only tell by looking at their expressions directly? What I'm trying to say is, at the beggining of the article they try to give it a vibe that you can detect emotion even when the person has a different expression, but then later in the article, they ask you to try to experiment by doing different expressions in the mirror by telling you how to do these expressions and saying what emotion you should be feeling. After you make those expressions they ask if doing the expression ""made you feel slighlty happy"" (para.9). It later states that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (para. 9). This sentence says that it may help produce emotions. In other words they still might not know how you are actually feeling a certain emotion after doing an expression.

This article might explain observations like in a fake smile, ""the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomantic major"" (para. 8), but expressions can vary on different people. Not all people are the same as others. Just because someone might look different when they express a emotion, doesn't mean that right away that they are expressing a different emotion. Now I know some people might say how accurate technology is, but a computer is a lifeless device that maybe could detect facial expressions, but might not know the true emotion of that person.

This article to me was pretty confusing. They tried to get you to believe that researchers have found a way to detect emotion, but then talk about how trying different expressions you make as a experiment show the emotion of the person's expression they made. By doing that, they make it seem like they only know how to recognize your emotion just by the certain expressions they want you to make. So can technology really detect someone's emotions if they are trying to express it a different way?   ",4,7,0.8386565446853638
7f46464,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author makes a point about this facial Action Coding System (FACS) and how it is useful in the classroom. In this essay, I will explain how this new software is useful. And how useful it would be in the classroom.

One example of this technology being used in a classroom is, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This gives a real life example on how it could be used in a classroom.

The author explains that we already use this in the classroom everyday. This example is, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried, etc."" This tells us that we use this everyday and we dont even know we use it. So we already use it in the classroom.

Another fine example is, ""The facial expressions for each smotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" This tells us that there are too many emotions to count and that it would be useful to teachers to be able to tell what the students are feeling.

Throughout this essay, I have described how the author tells us that using this technology would be useful. I fully belive that this would make the world a better place. We would be able to use it so we wouldn't hurt anyones feelings.                   ",2,7,0.8667072653770447

We shouldn`t have to use 3-D computor model to tell the emotions of people. All we have to do is look in a mirror. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (crows feet) at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes.

7fd1119,"Over the past years technology has had many different purposes in the world, and now with the help of the softtware ""Facial Action Coding System"" teachers in classrooms will now be able to adress their student's emotions when they act out of the normal. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it shows many examples regarding this topic. Because of the student's lack of expressing their emotions verbally, this computer software must be used to reveal what is happening within their heads.

In order to know what a student's mind wants to be happy and not bored, the teachers must use this software because a person cannot always comprehend facial features. In the aricle it talks about how many emotions showed by making facial expressions are not always comprehendable. According to the author, in paragraph 4 it states ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'"" (D'Alto 4). The term ""universal"" as it is being used in the sentence shows just the magnitude of how much a face can express. If teachers don't use this software, school might just remain boring to students without the teachers knowing.

Even though some people would agree that it is an invasion to privacy to use this in classrooms, the software would be for the good of the lack of communication between the teacher and students. The software would also improve the overall performance of the students during class, since now the teacher would know what to do when the class is bored or happy. In the article it also enhances the facts of nonverbal communication by stating ""'Most human communiction is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang"" (D'Alto 6). If emotions and communications are nonverbal, why not use technology to unravel the thoughts of a student. No teacher would want their students to feel negative feelings towards their classes, so here is an opportunity to make school better for both students and teachers.

Students may have to be provoked so they can show what they are feeling, however; the teachers making their students show emotion will help them be happier while being in the classroom. Students who do not want to be in school must be adressed first so they are better of in the future. This statement is supported by looking in the article where the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, butr also may even help produce them"" (D'Alto 9). Teacher making their students ""break a smile"" would aid their bordem into becoming a happier and more positive emotion.

Thus, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is positive, because of the help it would provide on the student's perspective of school. Less students would drop out and more students would go to school and learn just because of the enviroment that the computer software helps evoke.

In the text, the author Paragraph 6 states, “'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (D'Alto 6). If classroom computuers were to have the Facial Action Coding Systems, then students would be more encouraged to do school work outide of the classroom. Students would be able to work on their school work without being as confused or frustrated. The Facial Action Coding System could even help adults in college, work or at home. Adults would use the system for taxes, college work, bussness emails, etc.. Also, if a student or adult was trying to fill out a job application, not only would the employer get to know the student or adult by the application, they would get to know how smart or simple minded the worker would be.

The system could even tell if you are faking a smile or not. In paragraph 8, that author states, ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don’t lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn’t being truthful."" (D'Alto 8). Say if a student looks confused or upset, and the only thought that comes up is that the student is not ok, but even thought the teacher asks the student if he/she is ok, the student dosen't want to embarass himself/herself in front of the class, so they continue to say they are fine. The system will see that the student is confused or frustrated so it will try to help the student the best they can.

The new technology should be used on students. The system would help students with their confusion, frustration, and aner during class and outside of class.

801b999,I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom because it helps the student get a better understanding of the lesson. For example if a student is confused about what to do the computer will detect this and modify the lesson so that the student would be more successful. In my opinion i think this would help out alot in the classroom because many students get confused or bored while doing work and most of the time its because they do not understand. with the new technology this would limit confused students and may save the teacher the time of having to explained the instructions again. it may also prevent the student from giving up or recieving a bad grade on the assignment due to preforming poorly. Although we can determine another human's emotions sometimes it is difficult because a person might smile at you but may be hurt inside so you may take this as if the person is ok. the person may also have mixed emotions which gives a person a different emotion instead of the correct emotion or how the person is really feeling. However with the computer you'll never br mistaken and can always find out a person real expression regardless if they are forcing a smile or not. In the article it states that when a person smiles muscles called the zygomatic major will lift the corner of their mouth and when a person is forcing a smile their mouth strectch sideways instead of upward. but how would a teacher know the difference if they are not aware of this. This new technology helps out with that and makes things better not only for the student but for the teacher as well.,3,7,0.8993567228317261
8035bd1,"Having a computer that can tell what you are feeling can and can't be a good thing. Like you could be sad or depressed and not want anyone to know but they computer does. It can send information to people and you didn't want those people knowing how you are feeling. This can cause problems in a family because it may tell them something they didn't want to know.

First off some people would rather keep to themselves because sometimes showing their real self can hurt others. You can always fake being happy or fake being interested in something that you aren't, but the computer can figure out how you are really feeling and let people know that you aren't interested in the thing they are talking about or happy that someone is talking to you. It can ruin everything between people. The article states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This is saying that sometimes people don't put much effort into emotions like for instance smiling, sometimes people don't smile as broadly as they would like to.

This is my opinion on being able to have a computer analyze how you are feeling. I think it would be a bad idea and it would be better off to let people keep their feelings to themselves. Computers being able to tell your feelings is a bad idea and shouldn't come to life. We should keep it the same as it is now, where people can be themselves and not worry about people getting scared or hurt by their true selves. ",3,7,0.686688244342804
8048efc,"Some people say the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable and some say it's not valuable. If would to ask me I would say the system is valuable in many ways and them ways can be very helpful in paticular situations. For example, the classroom computer can tell how you feeling by looking at your face, can recognize when a student become confused or bored in a classroom, and they can also indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. For teachers this system can become 10 times helpful, but what really stand out it me right now it can recognize when a student become confused or in a classroom.

This stands out to me because this can helpful or easier to read when a student is student is struggling. 80% of students in a classroom don't usually don't ask for help because they afraid of saying some wrong in front of the whole classroom. Which instead of raising hand the teacher can go straight to the student and have a one on one converstation to make the student feel comfortable. Plus, not only it can see if you confused, it can also tell when you bored. It was said "" the system can see this by looking at your facial expressions or your muscles in your face."" So if a student get bored in class usually intend to go to sleep.

A teacher can look at the system without saying a word and change up the lesson a bit more fun because if you would to ask me paying attention in class is the key to success. Then lets not for get about the other example, "" the system can tell how a friend feeling by looking at their face.""

Some people say this is not a very big deal, but it's really is because one thing a teacher want to do is to get know it's class. When a sees some bad emotions in the system the teacher can reach out and the student in a personal situation. Also give the student space or can be cuation because the student can go off at any second and cause a major classroom disruption. Plus, this can help with team activities and create special bonds because in the text it stated empathy may happen because we unconsciuly imitate another person's feelings"" ,which can be helpful to friends. So if you believe this is fake then you should really read this next section.

In the text it stated "" they even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile."" When it's usally false smile it was said the mouth is stretched side ways in paragraph 8. Also it can read the muscle in your face to tell something is real or not,which help people understand one another better. ""Then in the text it mentioned these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" So can help teachers or students solve situations more quicker and easier in a classroom. Some people disagree though.

People disagree because they nothing can understand a person a feeling. A human with the same emotions can't even understand the next people feelings, what make you think a system or technology can do it. There many apps on phones or computers that be telling straight lies. Systems always catches viruses and always starts to act up it can be giving wrong information. Now you in somebody personal business and make them very angry. In the text it said "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that convoys happy."" So a machine can't do it either, but in my personal opinion it can help.

The Facial Action Coding Machine can help with telling when a friend is happy or not. Also it can help when to tell a student feel bored or confused. Lastly, it can tell when a student is using fake facial expressions. With these the classrooms of this world can become very more complex.

807917d,"The Facial Active Coding System is a very new and innovative technology that has a variety of applications, and a large support for the advancement of it. However, there are some uses that have been mentioned that I fel wouldn't be extremely useful. One of these is the use of this technology in the classroom. While the Facial Action Coding System has alot going for it, the technology has small value when it comes to classroom use. Let's take a look at the aspects that make this technology both not valuable and valuable in the classroom. We'll start by looking at what benefits would come with the use of this technology in schools.

While the Facial Action Coding System isn't, in my opinion, extremely practical for classroom activities, it can still play some role in classroom use. For example, the text states that - according to Professor Thomas Huang, the innovator behind this technolgy - the technology can be used to tell if a student doing work on a computer is confused or understanding, which would help to ensure that a teacher is readily available to assist the student. In addition, Huang goes on to say that this technology can change lesson material on-the-spot if a student doesn't show interest or progress. Thirdly, the text implies that a computer program can work much more like a human instructor if it is able to detect a student's emotion. These are the main positive uses the author gives in regards to education, but I feel that these reasons aren't all they say.

While the uses in the previous paragraph make the technology seem very useful, I feel that these aren't problems in today's education system - and most certainly do not need to be handed over to a computer. For example, while the text says that this technology can make computer-based lessons more like being taught by a human instructor, I feel that a physical instructor is still always needed. There will always be a problem that even a computer can't solve, so I feel that trying to find more ways to slowly downsize the amount of teachers isn't a truly valid reason for using this technology. In addition, the text says that the program could tell if a student was becoming confused or bored, and alter lessons based on what it detects. I feel that this is also an invalid claim, as technology as new as this will be far from perfect. Imagine if a student were to not react in any way, but the software incorrectly detects them as being confused. The learning program will then switch to a reteaching section, and the student will be forced to do an activity that isn't neccessary to their success. These are just a handful of reasons why this software is not practical, but there are multiple other reasons against this technology that aren't countered in the argument.

There are many reasons that I feel this technology should not be implemented in school that aren't countered in the article. For example, because the technology is so new and so powerful, one could only imagine the cost of it. At the end of the day, the shear amount of money poured into these programs will never be paid back by reduction of teachers - and school systems will most likely never get their money's worth of the implementation. In addition, I feel that because of the price, there would be very few school corporations willing to implement it - and the few that do will face limited support because of how few sales would be. Thirdly, I feel that this technology is not worthwhile to the field of education because of technology's rapid growth. I feel that by the time this technology would become even semi-standardized, technology will have already moved on passed facial recognition, and wouldn't seem to be as innovative as it does now, at the early stage of it's life. While there are many other reasons why this technology isn't worthwhile in schools, I feel that these are the most significant.

In conclusion, you can now see both the benefits and drawbacks of using Facial Action Coding System in schools. While the technology as a whole yields a very great future application-wise, I cannot see any practical purpose of any educational system implementing it. It is costly, still in the early stages of its life, and no matter how hard inventors try - computers and artificial intelligence (for the timebeing) will never be capable of the same mental abilities that are possesed by an actual human being.

The new technology of the Facial Action Coding System could help the teacher improve their teaching, such as, if a student is tired the teacher may take a little break to let the kids recouperate and wake up a bit more to help them focus better on the lesson. If a student is upset, or sad, the teaher will notice and pull the student aside to figure out if they are okay or not. This new technology will improve teaching and the way students learn.

In todays essay we are talking about if using FACS would be good use in the classroom. This subject I strongly disaprove of for many reasons.

To start in paragraph four Dr.Huang stats ""The facial expressions for each emotions are universal"" later in the tesxt it talks about how the computer can read the six basic emotions, with their being universal facial expresions the computer can give off flase claims saying if a student is ""happy"", ""sad"", or more. The next reason I stand against this is we can already tell most of teh emotions from just looking at someone, lets look to paragraph five which says you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face and that claims would could not describe each facial trait, this shows we don't need a most likly very expensive computer to tell us what we already know. A teach can clearly tell if a studnet is bored or sad and thats why today many teachers try to teach one day with a hands on activity for the students who benefit off of that anf they do other lessons with a different way to teach for the students who are better at such way of learning.Lastly I want to look at paragraph eight were is talks about fake smiling and how the computer ""could tell"" who is being truful and lying. Using this in the school place would not be the best, imagine this a student is talking to his or her ""friend"" and the ""friend"" is smiling and laughing but its not a true laugh its a fake laugh this could ruin ""friendships"". While I am sure many people want the ""fake"" friends out of their life since this technology would not only be used for teachers it could be used with sutdnts in the class room it could cause sooner causes of childhood depression and give insecurtites to stundets at a younger age.

When you ask yourself if using the FACS technology in the classroom if it is good or bad make sure to think about a couple things. The first being very few things come out perfect so the technology would need to be fixed since it can read false facial emotions. The next one being we cna already read basic emotions and some teachers already try to use all the tyoes of learning for studnetas within the year so eveyrone can learn. Lastly this could lead to your child to have sooner depression and insecurites. The last reason to not have this is the largest as America already suffers with huge amounts of ealry aged childhood depression leading to more susides you have to look a the big picture here, in todays socitey we are already leaninig more towards heavy technology and sadly soon our expressions wont matter only our internet expressiosn will so there is no need to put so much money into a device they may give off false inofrmation. I hope you take a look at my essay before decidng if this FACS device is helpful or not in todyas socitey.",3,7,0.8881431221961975
8120133,"Mona Lisa face expressions are different than others face's, depending on how the person look with no smile, no anger, and no saddness. The emotional communication is nonverbal, showing the more emotion there is though our face's. Smile' are all differnet depending if it's a real one or a forced one. Faces don't lie, Smiling isn't being truthful they said. Willing to put on a face, it usually works most of the time, but not only to expresses emotion, it's tells us how they are feeling today or what they are going though.

When actors fake a smile or a frown they don't feel it really, they just make the face to prove or hide what they are feeling or showing. They act the show and give what's on the paper and have the same movement that we humans have to use when we express how we feel.

We have six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and there is sadness. They associated with each of our characteristics movements of the facial muscules. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" We have some software tracks on these facial movement that our brain follows, it can find out you're mix emotion and expression by you're neutral face. This not means what you can really see without the tech and just see the real feeling and the real smile or their sadness. This Facial Action Coding System is identifing the moment of the face right that minute, but not what they are feeling right after or before.

What I'm tryig to say is that our computers are blind and won't see what's really happening, our faces can lie to computers but not to people who know's what they been though and can see in other human their self. You got to see it deep into their eyes and smile if they are really happy or just really sad within their ife. It's different how the Da Vinci code is, with converting their specific emotoin with the new electronic code.    ",2,7,0.748562216758728

However are these new technological advancements really effecively improve the lives of humans? There is no dought that technology has improved the work and efficiancy of humans; howeve ther ae some tasks that can never replace a human and heir ability to understand each other. A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System has been developed to enale computers to identify human emotions. Scientis want to put the technology into use in the classroom in order more efficiantly econgize the emotions o students and better help them in the classroom. This may sound like a good idea on paper however, using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a bad idea because no computer can understand the empotions of an human better than a human and everyone is different and unique.

Human emotion is a complex pocedure and the emotional expression alone cannot identify the true feelings of a human. Only the understanding and sypmathy of a fellow human can read and understand a human's emotion outside the expression itself. As the author continues to describe the echnoloy behind the Facial Action Coding System he begins to explain an everyday occurance where human are able to identiy their fello man's facial expreesion. The author continues to say that even though humans are able to efficianltly know and uderstand the emotion of other humans they are less likely to decibe said emotion. This passage claims that although humans are able to identify the emotions of other umans they are not as effeciant and calculated that computer technlogy. Humans more than anything have a gift to understand each other with the slightest expression. If a student is strggling an compuer may miss not understand the degree of destress the student is in. Computers are unable to show the same amount to sympathy and unerstanding of a human. If a student is struggling it is more effective for ehe instructure o hlp the sdnt.

Every facial expression does not mean the same thing for everybody. Every man is diffeent and a comtuter should not lable a person's emotion through facal expressions alone. The author decribes the technology behind the Facial Action Coding System and its knowleg of muscle tructure to identify emotional expressions. In the passage Dr. Huang, one o the developers of the Facial Action Coding System said "" the facial expressions for each emotion is universal...even though individuals often show varing degrees of expression"" (D'Alto 4). This quote implis that every human is capable of showing the same facial expression to express to describe the same emotion, saying it is ""universal"". Althout to a certain extaint human emotional expressions are widely identified as very simular, there is no definate expression to a definate emotions. Computes requre calculate and measunments to succesfully idenify a human's emotion. It is very easy to convincly fake an emotional expression and facial expreeions don't always corospond with it's respectd emotion. Everone expresses themselves in a different way and not everythig is definate.

In conclusion using technology to read students' emotional expressions is a bad idea because no computer can understand the empotions of an human better than a human and everyone is different and unique.",3,7,0.8872092366218567

As humans, some of us may not realize how smart technology is really getting. The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify different types human emotions. Think about how this new kind of technology could change the world. This Facial Action Coding System could be incredibly valuable by reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

In the article D'Alto states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson.."" With this technology students may be able to understand lessons more quickly and easily. This coding system could also help more troubling students excel in the classroom while saving the teachers time. By modifying the lesson, the Facial Coding System would also keep the attention of learners. This could train students to become exception learners as they grow.

In paragraph eight of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how the muscles in the face change according to your mood. It also states ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major muscle..and the risorius."" This tells the reader that this facial coding system is accurate on its reading by reading every single muscle on the face and correlating it to different moods. Because this technology is accurate, there may be little to no mistakes in reading a student's face in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System could change how students would learn. This technology would help students excel and grow to become more intelligent individuals. This could help the following generations behind us smarter and more understanding. This facial coding system can help students achieve their learning goals in the classroom. This new technology would be valuable in the classroom for students.",4,7,0.8578547239303589

a lot of money on something that can't help with leaning can be the cause of many prolems. The money that would be used on the new technology, could be better use in other parts of the classroom or certain clubs.

Having to us a computer just to tell if someone is happy or sad, is a waste of time when you can tell with your own eyes, ""...we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"" (D'Alto). Even though the software uses technology to calculate every muscle in the face and give a detailed response to that persons evey emotion, one facial emotion can tell a lot about a persons day or just they way they act. Many people throughout the day show one emotion to hide the other because it brings tension to the ones that care about that person. ""...carefully reproduce smiling and frownign as a way of creating the emotions on stage""(D'Alto), this is an example of how facial expressions are used just to put on a scene.

Waisting time and money on 3D printers and computer software is useless when your main software is your own eyes. Schools always complain about they never have money for sports,clubs, and materials for classrooms, but alwys have time to update thier technology. Being able to tell how a person really feels is a cool way to learn more about them, but one emotion can be figured ut by that one persons facial expressiosn.",3,7,0.8367652893066406

Technology is statrting to become a great impact on most people, even facil expresstions can tell an emotion of someone. Technology like a 3-D computer could help someone bring a smile to there face like anything els would.

The process with a 3-D computer modle is a modle of someones face, muscels have to move like human muscles. As it explains in the article ""All 44 major muscels in the modle must move like human musscels. Movement of one or more muscles is called ""action unit."" A guy named ""Eckman"" classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. for example the article say's ""your frontails pars, lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyesbrows whe you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.""

819f0be,"The emotional expressions a person uses can tell a lot about that person and how they are feeling at that very moment. New technology has been helping people decode each others emotions. The use of this technology can help people understand each other just a bit better than before. People are becoming more aware of how to decribe our emotional expressions that are on our faces. Just like with the Mona Lisa painting scientists says ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". The Mona Lisa painting can help us understand that even though it was painted many years ago we can still tell how she was feeling by her facial expression. This shows that we can do more than just decribe what we are feeling at the moment. This shows how we can keep people entertained.

If somebody is bored of a television show or a commercial then they will not pay as close of attention to the computer then when you like the show or commercial. How would the computer keep the person entertained? This issue can be solved by the Facial Action Coding System, because the computer could recognize that person is bored and then change the type of show or commercial to what they like. If the computer reads that the person is enjoying the show or commercial, then the computer will leave the type of show or commercial the way it is. This all can be showed by what facial expression a person uses at the computer.

This way people are more entertained with what a person watches.

The Facial Action Coding System would help show if a person is actually learning or not while teaching. The student's face can be recognized as confused or bored. This will help a teacher recognize that they should try a different technique as they are teaching. When a person is having ""mixed feelings"" on a subject then that issue can be addressed, so the person is no longer feeling that way. In the article Dr. Huang says "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" so this tells that people can know each other better with this technology.

Our faces have 44 major muscles that helps tell our emotions. These muscle helps scientists see if a person is pretending to be happy or is a person is genuinely happy. These muscles can tell if an important celebrity or politician is perhaps lying about liking a certain idea. This is a valuable tool to use, because if a country is wanting to go at war with another country then we can analyze the people's emotions on the idea to see if it is truely a good idea to do. Another way it is useful to know a leader's emotions is to see if they are scared or bluffing about an event that may or may not happen based on their emotions.

Our emotional expressions can help people understand their true feelings about each other. This is a valuable source to know at school, watching tv, and even during a war. We communicate a lot of ourselves through our emotional expressions. This is by showing what we are disgusted in, what we are scared of, or even what we like just in general. This technology can show us how a person from 100 years ago was feeling in a picture, because a picture can say a thousand words just like our emotional expressions can. ",3,7,0.8241796493530273
81ee842,"Imagine if you could realize your friends emotions all the time. Facial Action Coding Systems might be our new way to know how someone is feeling. New software is being developed to better comunicate emotions. What if we had this technology in schools? To better understand our peers and know if they are okay. This would be a tremendous advance in schools nowadays.

If we had this technology in school teachers could better understand their students. Teachers could find out how the student are feeling and adjust according to what the students are thinking. This machine would help classrooms everywhere because if a student is board of the lesson odds are they are not going to pay attention. A student is not always willing to talk to a teacher and tell them why they are not doing well or what they dont like about class. You cant always be perfect at guessing how someone is feeling by what you see because they could be hiding their emotions from you. People would think that the machine would not work right and it would be false information being read. The machine is constructed by callibrating it to recognize all 44 major muscles in the model to move exactly like humans move. The machine has six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. And along with the characteristics are movements of the facial muscles. Each one of the emotions are designed to be read of human facial movements to detect emotion. All the steps to constucting this machine are great and are taken off of human facial movement.

Facial Action Coding machines could help teachers and staff stop suicidal thought or actions from occuring. Teachers are at school to help students and just the regular teacher dosen't always catch a student having a horrible day or getting bullied constantly. This machine could help teachers find the kids that are having it rough and sit down with them and talk. This machine would take away the amount of suicidal thoughts and even suicide at high schools all across the country.

This machine would help in many different catigories. If teachers started using this machine and making kids feel better everyday it would make students want to come back to school and want to learn. This would increase grades and student to teacher bonds. The students would carry that home and that would help parents. Kids would do more choirs and help around the house more. They would stop being so hostile twords their parents. This machine could bring so much good to schools and communities all across the world.

Although this machine would be great to have in schools it could be taken as a privacy issue. Students might not feel comfortable if a teacher or elder has a machine that can read how they are feeling. This could be an issue for many parents as well. If a parent does not want this in the school their child goes to they are more than likely to take their child out of that school. This could provoke other parents as well to get the wrong idea about this machine. The parents could see this as a danger in a school because they would no nothing about the machine or the students could be frightened from this machine.

To conclude my essay I think this device would be a great thing to have in schools. It could prevent kids from being bullied, having suicidal thought or even being board in class. It would help teachers get the right idea of what to teach in class and get the idea of students that might be having a really hard time. All in all this machine would be a great tool to use in schools all across the world.",5,7,0.8745282888412476
822ec7e,"Value of Face Action Coding Systems in Schools Today,

I believe that in some cases face recogniton in classrooms could be slightly valuable but overall I think that there would be more negative effects than positive effects when it comes to Face Action Coding on school computers. Some negative effects of the Face Action Coding System could be things like innacurate face readings, more difficult or ineffective way of learning, or minimization of comunication and decreased likelyhood of relationships between students and their teachers. These examples lead me to think that facial recognition is not important for schools to have for their students.

If the face coding software was inacurate, your work would be effected in ways you might not want it to be or you could come off a different way than you are really feeling. In the text it state that the software can detect if a person beomes confused or bored with something if you make a certan facial expression. Once this happens the information would get relayed back to your teacher so he or she can make ajustments for your assignment if needed, but what if the facial expression that was made was totally erellevant to your assignment. As I do assignments I sometimes think about other things and make facial expressons about my thoughts. Maybe the expression of confusion or bordum might cross my face and get relayed back to the teacher when the facial expression made was not made because of the assignment. These are examples of how facial recognition could be giving incorrect information back to teachers.

If the computer could tell ever emotion you had towards your assignment you would never need to actually communicate face to face with your teacher. The author shows in the text that as the emotions are detected, the teacher would give modifycations to the assignment without you even asking them to or asking for help. Most communication between teachers and students is done by asking questions about assignments and how they feel about something in the class. I believe that students should be able to speak face to face to the people assigning their work instead of turning away from most communication between students and teachers.

To me I can see the Facial Coding System effecting the learning of students. In the text it states that it can modify the assignmets just like a teacher would if it detects signs of being confused or bored. If a student is neither bored or confused but the computer detects that by their facial expression, then it could change the assinment even if the student didn't need the assignment changed. This would either give the student a break by making the assignmet too easy or it would push the student out of where they need to be by making the assignment harder. This would then effect how the student learns.

In conclusion, facial recogniton in classrooms will lead to more problems than it would help by bringing it into schools. I would rather share my emothions to a teacher when I felt the need to instead of a computer telling emotions back to my teacher that may be innacurate. I also would rather have a teacher giving me modified work so It would help me in learning. This is why I disagree with Facial Coding Systems in schools today.",5,7,0.8197399973869324

I wouldn't want that because it seems like someome is looking at what you are doing pretty much like a stacker and i think that is weired. I think we shouldn't have that because what if someone is hacking that program and gets to my phone or computer that means they could see what we look like and what we are doing. It says using videos imagery the new emotion-recognition software track these movements in a real face.

Is the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom valuble? The technology is valuable, because it can tell if you are confused or bored, and change what you are doing to something that is either easier to understand or more entertaining to learn. That is something valuable, becuase not only does it help students, but it also helps teachers teach the kids.

How could a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? Well, "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called and 'action unit.' "". "" For example, your frontalis par lateralis mucles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."". This is really useful also because, the computer can tell if your sad or happy. "" Imagine a comptuer that knows when you're happy or sad. For examples, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."".

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'. The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive--for video games or video sugery. 'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Haung. 'So computers need to understand that, too.'"". That is valuable, it helps students and teachers, by just recognizing our facial expressions. It would make it easier for the special needs kids too, because instead of teachers having to change their lessons a hundred different times. The computer would change it as soon as it reads the kids expression that he didn't understand.

Is this Technology to read the emotinal expressions of students in a classroom valuable? Yes, this technology is very valuable, for someone who don't understand things so easily this would help extremendisly. For the shy kid who is confused but don't want to ask for help. Or the mean boy who wants good grades but don't want to ask for help because his buddies might make fun of him. Even for the smartest person in class, it would help.

8388adc,"You're walking into a classroom seeing different faces, different attitudes, and different emotions. Do you think you'll be able to tell the emotion of each student? What if you were sitting in a classroom? Do you believe a computer or any technology that's able to read you and your classmates emotional expresionsis valuabe? If you do, then I disagree.

I believe the use of technology that's able to read the emotional expressions of students isn't valuable.First, I believe this because the software is able to show only six emotions. In the article, it states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness,"" This shows that emotions like empty or basic won't be shown. If these emotions aren't shown, then what would the system show for an empty-feeling person.

Next, I believe this system isn't valuable because some people can have deceiving faces. In the article, the author, D'Alto says, ""...and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" This shows that the system is using people's facial expression to tell their emotion. A student can have a bored look on their face, but be very interested in what's going on at the same time. Therefore, the system will believe the student is bored, even though the student is far from it.

Finally, I believe this system isn't valuable because no mater what emotion a person is feeling, some people just have a natural neutral face. In the fourth paragraph it says, ""Each expression is comapred against a neutral face."" This shows that when a person has a neutral face they're only showing no emotion. Even though a person shows no emotion, deep down inside they might be happy or sad without anyone knowing.

This is why I believe the Facial Action Coding Sysytem is not valuable at all. The system is only able to show basic emotions. The system can't detect deceiving faces. This system clarifies the neutral face as no emotion. I hope you agree.",4,7,0.8609757423400879

Also a person can be happy when they smile, laugh, or joke with you. you can tell fear when a person or friend eyes open, and when a they are speachless.

Next: do think it would be a good idea to make a computer thats u can only access with your face because now a days people tend to steal stuff that doesnt belong to them like for example i had a friend who tried to steal my headphones one day but i had officer force her to give them back but when she gave them back the were broke.

Conclusion: i think that mona lisa probably was a hard picture to face scan because there were so many differnt copys of the original paintning but im pretty sure the real painting is in a museum heavinly gauarded by people with heavy artilllery and grenades and army men with truck but inconclusion if your a great painter do your best because one day u might a famouse painter like Leanardo da Vinci or bettter   ",1,7,0.5265568494796753
84195f6,"Everday, wether we are in a classroom, at our house, or out in public, we are constantly decoding the emotions around us. For example, when your friend walks up to you with a stern face and squinted eyes, you will most likley assume that he or she is angry with you. Recognizing facial expressions is something we as human beings have done for the past thousands of years, sometimes involuntary. With that being said, we do not need a computer software to tell us everything we already know, a frown means you are upset, a stern face means you are mad, a lopsided eyebrow means you are confused, and a smile means you are happy. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.

Being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions, may sound like an awesome idea. However, this program is 100% useless. A system that can decode a humans emotion is udderly pointless, for no one needs to know the exact compostion of a human face and their emotions. As stated in the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation""every day."" I mean just think about it, what would you do if you knew the exact percent of happiness in someone, or maybe the percent of saddness? Exaclty, you would do nothing. That information is useless and a waste of time and money. We don't need a machine to exemplify the percise decimal of happiness, sadness, or confusin in any one person.

Whenever you buy a new computer, a new software, or even basic technolgy needs, the prices are always far above then what you predicted. That same concept includes this new software called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). This devloped and intelligent program will cost a pretty penny, without a doubt, for both the producer and the consumer. Not only will you need to forfit you money for this program, but most at home computers are uncapable to withold the magnitude of this program. The article states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Spending money, time, and effort on a skill humans have already learned is pointless and fruitless. The development of the technolgy industry has allowed for billions of dollars to be consempated, allowing for the goverment to go in debt, among other things as well. Introducing this program to the population will allow for money that has been worked hard for, be thrown down the drain.

Incorporating this new software program into classrooms around the globe is unessary for the development of students minds. Being able to detect specific emotions in a school setting is useless and a waste of time and money. Teachers are going to college, getting a degree, and expandign their teaching limits in order to be able to correctly investigate and discover the emotions of their students. As a teacher, that is their job. Introducing this technolgy into classrooms will not be beneficial, for knowing exaclty the percent compostion of one persons emotion is pointless, useless, and a frutile attempt to expanding the technology industry.

FACS is a new, intelligent, developed software system that allows for the emotions of any one person be decomposed into specific percent numerals. This evolving program incorporates new and imporoved technolgy functions into a redily avalible software. However, introducing this program to the world with cause nothing but useless and pointless results. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.

8431a92,"Facial Action Coding System could potentially be valuable in the classroom. For students with autism or some other form of mental disease, picking up on certain emotions and being able to tell how people are feeling does not come quite as easy as it does for other people. For them to have some sort of technology to help them learn how to tell what people are feeling could be a fantastic use of our worlds rapid technological advances.

To use this technology on students computers in order to tell how they are feeling and what confuses them or what they understand is a different story. In some ways, this could be a good thing because it would notify teachers when their students simply are not understanding a topic. But it also seems like a slight invasion of privacy and it seems that some people would not enjoy software that could detect your face and facial features at all times.

Our world has been making huge technological advances for awhile now. In just 40 years we went from the computer game Pong to having Virtual Reality. This kind of technological advance would be big but quite frankly not so shocking. Software that makes a 3-D model of your face and calculates your muscle movement in order to detect emotion is somewhat terrifying in the sense that a computer can now detect how you feel, but in some situations this technology could be useful. ",3,7,0.8117547631263733
8439c0e,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This new technology enables computers to identify human emotions. Essentially the program looks at a person's face and compares it to a neutral face and then it analyzes what muscles the person used and then it can tell a person's emotion or emotions. However, reading people's emotions is not the only thing this software can do. I believe his software would be a great thing and the world could develop more and get lots of benefits from it.

Not only can this new technology read a person's emotions, it can also make computer animated faces more expressive. This technology would also be good idea becuase ""Most human commuication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This quote is talking about facial expressions and body language. Those two examples are some ways that humans communicate nonverbally. For example when something weird or odd happens and you can't say anything out loud you might give your friend

look and they will know exactly what you mean. Well in my personal experience, my friend and I have gone to a few public places and something out the ordinary would happen. However in some situations it's just not appropriate to start laughing loudly, so we just give each other a glance that sort of means 'did you just see that too?' and we let out a little giggle. But sometimes someone may send you a look and you have no idea what they're trying to communicate. And as for body language, if a person is sitting very stiff and straight up then you would assume the are uncomfortable or trying to be professional, the real reason could be revealed in their facial expression sometimes not always so this new technology could be helpful in showing a person's real emotion. The technology being able to read emotions could also be helpful because what if a child is in an

unsafe environment at their home and they lie to the person investigating, like the social worker, becuase they have been coahed or they don't want to be away from their parents. That could potentially save the child and could get them out of their unsafe environment. This could also be used on criminals, I'm sure police are trained to read facial expressions and know nervous mannerisms but they possibly can't always be accurate. Computer animated faces getting more advanced would be good because then video game makers could get more money for having better graphics. And the faces would be more clear and human like even though they are computer animated.

Also this new technology could make learning more effective and fun for some children. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" Dr.Huang says. In school everyone is taught the same thing almost exactly the same way. However everybody is so different from each other and they could have a different learning style. I don't believe every person has the same exact brain and way of thinking and figuring things out. So why isn't our curriculum different for each learning style? Everybody could sill be taught the same thing just in different ways and that is what this new technology could do. The average of students dropping out of high school could decrease.

In conclusion, I believe this new technology is a good thing with multiple possible

benefits. We could understand people better and how they express their emotion and possibly find out if they aren't being truthful. Students could learn better and want to go to school becuase their lesson could be modified to challenge but not over challenge them, so then they won't be bored or confused. Which could potentially lead to fixing other problems like students giving up and quiting school. Also since we the technology has the potential to tell us if a person is making an expression that could lead us to belive they are lying, more criminals could get caught and be forced to deal with their consequences.

Well do to a brand new algorithum made by Dr. Paull Eckman, creator of the FACS(Facial Action Coding System), you can finaly be exited about learning about greek and latin roots. This program can detect how you are felling and in what precentages. In the following paragraphs they will talk about if we should or should not read students faces to make the classroom experience more enjoyable.

Well to start off the technology has decoded the Mona Lisa smile. You know they one the smile that seams somewhat omanis when you look at it. well this program has determend that the paintings famous smile is mostly happy. The spcifics of the smile are as follows she's 83 precent happy, 9 precent disgusted, 6 precent fearful, and 2 precent angry. This computer software known as the FACS looks adn all 44 major mussles and then makes a decison based on that. How can this be helpfull to schools.

Now if you actualy like doing greek and latin roots in your english class you may not need this new technology, However you may not like another class like math classes. If we start doing eveything on computers like all of our lessons for example we will probably need this to keep us from not falling asleep during the class.

If we do end up adopting this new software into our computers it could make us have more fun lessons and make the classes end faster, well do to preception. If the technology could be used with just a webcam then you could just look at your students face and see if they are bored or off task and make the lesson more enjoyable. We could just look at the precentages of the kids facial expressions like how they found out how the Mona Lisa's smile was mostly happy.

In conclution we could make our childrens classroom experiences more enjoyable. Even if it is a little creepy to have a software that watches you for your whole classroom experience. But it mostlikely is worth it to make shcool more enjoyable for the kids in them. ",3,7,0.6970412731170654

I know your friends will probably want to know but they can just ask instead of pulling out their computer and scanning your face and doing all this research. It's an interesting thing but at the same time it's kinda useless. In paragraph 8 it states that an expert knows when your facial expression is lying.

It states that "" these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" To be honest, i couldn't care less if a celebrity or anyone else is fake smiling at me. How will this device benefit you is the real question. In paragraph 5 it states that "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. "" but in paragraph 7 it explains to you if you look into a mirror and do it step by step how to look happy, it will make you look happy. It even states "" does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? Can your lab partner recognize which one? In fact, these are the instruction for a face that looks happy.""

If they invented a whole app to tell them how you're feeling and didn't know how to explain how someone is feeling, they wouldn't have explained perfectly a person who is happy, even step by step. They device could be helpful just like the lie detecting test the polices use. But if you ask me, it's useless. In the 6th paragraph it states that The Mona Lisa is intended to bring a smile to your face, if you smile around anyone, they will smile, smiling is contagious then you'll know how they're feeling instead of wasting a lot of money on an expensive device.

In conclusion, if you want to wate your money on something useless, you can. To me, it would be smarter to invent something more useful instead of worrying about how someone else feels or how your entire class feels but at the same time the people who invented that are getting paid and that's all that matters.",3,7,0.725516140460968

When reading this article I came across Dr.Huang mentioning how the artist of this painting (Leonardo De Vinci) studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specicfic emotions.With new advanced technology,students are able to use it to calculate one another's expressions and learn about human anatomy and how the face muscles work togther to form an expression.Which could potientially be used for an anatomy course.

This technology will get wrong emotions of the students in the classroom. In the classroom, there may be students that generally look tired maybe from their parents genes, but teachers may mistake what the technology says about their facial expressions. The student with lazy eyes may understand what is going on and is enjoying it, so that doesn't mean that a teacher needs the extra technology to look for facial expression, but instead looking for the students who need help on a subject. in the article it says, ""...we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday.""

The article mentions that the computer technology has six basic emotions that are programed such as, ""...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness...""

Now there is a techonology called Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to indentify human emotions and it can be used for many differnet purposes. One way that has been introducesed to use it is by letting teachers use it to read students emotions. I think if we used it in class room settings, in schools, and for students it would be very valuable to their education.

For instance say a student is not under standing the concept of the lesson the teacher is teaching the Facial Action Coding System will be able to detect that the student is confused and the teacher can see that and go back and explain it again or they can work one on one with the student. Another way it could be helpful is if a student isn't being their usaual self and isn't focusing on their work the Facial Action Coading System can tell you if they are feeling sad or angry and the teacher can confront the student about it and maybe help them with that problem so they can get back to being focused in class.

The Facial Action Coding System can also tell if emotions are being faked or if they are real. It can do this by useing a little bit of anatomy by looking at which muscles are being used in the persons face. In a real smile the muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and the risorius. This can be seen sometimes without FACS, (Facial Action Coding System).

That can be used in situations like for say a student seems like they are doing fine with the material being taught in class or just seems happy but the teacher can't tell. They can use the Facial Action Coding System technology to determine wheather they should confront the student about it or not. If a teacher understands what their students are feeling they can change their teaching methods if needed to help their students succed in class. Some times the student may just be bored of the subject and it may be because of the way the teacher is teaching it, but if the teacher knows that they can spice it up a bit to make the material more enjoyable for that student to learn.

I think the use of The Facial Action Coding System would be very valuable in class rooms not for just the teacher, but also for the students because the teacher will be able to curve the way they do things for the better of the students education.

The FACS system will help the teacher understand what the student need more help with, and what they are more intrrested in.

The FACS system can read the facial muscles, and this is how it can detacte the emotions of people. It can even identify when someone has mixed emotions, and compares each expression with a neutral face. This is how it can regoinze when students are feeling bored, confused, or any other emotion. The inventor of the FACS system, Dr. Paul Eckman, is the one to classify the six basic emotions. He also was the one that asscociated each with characteristic movemetns of the facial muscles. Like when your frontalis pars lateralis raises your eyebrows when you are suprised, and you orbicularis oris tightens your lips when your angry. All this can help the system tell when the students in the classroom need a change in the lesson.

I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions. In his article, he uses the Mona Lisa as an example, and I personally think that it was a good example to help show her conveyed expressions.

Dr. Hung invented the Facial Action Coding System, which helps identify the emotions displayed on the human face,and paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. If this technology was used in a classroom setting, I think that it could be used to help teachers understand if some of their students are enjoying the lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System shows the six basic emotion that are associated with the movements of ones facial muscles. The basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology can also identify mixed emotions.

Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday. For example, a friend could probably tell how you feel by looking at your face. But some people might have trouble describing what each facial expression means. Dr. Hung had oserved had aritists like leonardo who had studied human anatomy that had helped them to paint human emotions. Similarly, Professor Hungs Facial Action Coding System is able to be electorically stored with some information about human anatomty and emotions.

Lastly, there are fourty-four major muscles in the human face. For example. a muscle called the obricularis oculi pars palabraeus is the muscle that makes the crow's-feet shape around your eyes. Experts can tell a real smile from a fake smile by the way your mouth is moved. Facial muscles can help produce emotions, by the movement of your muscles. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, I think that teachers could easily figure out the emotions that their students faces are conveying. This coding system seems to be revelotionary to me because of it can decipher emotions and it could help many people such as students, teachers, and even the government.

In conclusion, I personally think that with the help of this technology teachers will be able to read into their students emotions better. Also, teachers would be able to tell if students are lying to them. The value of this technolgy would be able to help them read the facial expressions of many people with diasbilites who have trouble conveying emotions. I beleive that is this type of technology were to be used in a classroom that it would be a great help to many teachers.        ",3,7,0.8637886643409729

In this passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" students from the University of Illinois collaborated with Prof. Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. They developed better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can how how the student is feeling and it can help see if the student is enjoying what it is learning.

One facial expression can give it all away of how you are feeling. Facial Action Coding System can identify mixed emotions, each expression that is being made is compared to a neutal face that is not showing any emotional. If a student is having a bad day or something is wrong with them the software will instantly let them know how they are feeling. As in the painting ""Mona Lisa"" they were not sure what her emotions ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

Another reason it is valuable is it can help see if a student is enjoying what it is doing. For example in the passage it says ""A classroom computer coul recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If that were to happen it would be able to modify the lesson such a effective human intructor.

The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Examples of why it is vaulable are while a student is working on a lesson the computer can find out how a student is feeling and seeing if a student is enjoying what he or she is learning.

There are many ways that this can help students with there education. This technology can help students understand what they are learning better, which can result in a better education.

For example, this technology can help a student that is having difficulty on a lesson they are learning just by identifying there emotions. In paragraph six of the article it states, that a class computer can identify when a student is becoming bored or if the student is having trouble understanding the material, then the technology can change up the lesson so that the student does not get bored or confused. This results in a better education for students. With this type of technology students will be more educated and that will help future generations to come.

In the article, the author describes to us, this new technology, Facial Action Coding System, which can identify human emotions. This is indeed valuable to students in classrooms. This tech can read students emotions and modify the lesson, so that the student understands the material. the Facial Action Cosing System will soon be essential for learning in the future so that students can be more educated for when they are out in the real world.

Can the Facial action coding really read how humans feel like how can you read how he/she feel just by looking at them in paragragh 4 it states that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"" if the computur compares your face to another one how do it really know how your feeling how is ti getting the presentages and is it really right about how you feel.

The computer can tell you how you look or how it looks like hoe you feeling but in a picture it probably look like how you feel but how do the computer really know how you feel after or before you took the picture. what if you just did a regular smile but you felt sad would the computer read that you are sad and not happy.

In the Mona LIsa it looks like she is happy in the first paragragh it states that ""she's 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearfuland 2 percent angry"" how do the computer know that she is angry how can a computer read the perfect percent of how you are feeling.

I think that people don't need a computer that can tell them how happy,sad or mad because that's their feelings so how do they know that they are feeling that way.

The only reason why i feel that way because i feel that if if they didnt know the emotions they wouldnt know if we are nad or sad like in the text it says "" when your looking a mirrior you raise your lips at the corners of your mouth "" which makes you seem mad , So i feel that if technology didnt know what our mood was then theres no point of it .

Other reasons why i think the Facial Coding System should know our emotions because when they ask a question i feel that you should show emotion in the question they ask like things like why you feel that way , when you felt that way , & when will you change your feeling about the way you feel .

In the text it says that humans perform a impressive calculatiion everyday i see that because when you say or do something the author feels that way because you wouldnt know when you read something you have emotion and that can change the way you feel about everything . ",2,7,0.854479193687439

I do not think that we should use technology to determine people's emotion(s), It wouldn't help us out on advancing as a soceity. Also not everyone makes the same facial expression for the emotion they are feeling so its going to be based on generalized facial expressions which won't be accurate. And also what kind of information would be collected by the way peop[le are feeling and how would that help us old in our daily lives. Also having some camera watch you the whole time while your online doesn't seem like the most enjoyable experience for everyone.

If the student gets confused on a problem and the computer can read that they are confused and it notifys the teacher the teacher can go over and help the student.

In the classroom there are some students who don't like speaking out or ask questions because they are shy or don't feel smart because they have to ask questions but in this way they won't have to deal with any of that because the computer reads that they are having trouble. In the article it says that Dr. Huang could read how Mona Lisa was feeling just by a computer telling him. This system could also be a way to teach kids how to read how people are really feeling because in today's world no one can fully read how people are feeling.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang says "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too"" computers should understand that so they can read how people are feeling to make things easier. The computers in todays society hare very good technology but i think this would make it better. In most schools nowadays the students already have lap tops so this would be a great idea.

It may not sound ideal to use it everywhere however it could drasticly help improve the education of students. The facial action coding system would be very important in a classroom, giving the teacher vauable feedback. This new technology would allow teachers to improve class by keep students engaged and better helping them succeed.

The facial action coding system gives teachers valuable feedback about their student.""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness""(Alto 4). The information these basic emotions would provide to a teacher could have significant impacts on the classroom. Knowing what the student is feeling during a certain activity or presentation during the class, the teacher would be better equiped to help their students. Teachers would be able to better meet the needs of the student to better help them learn and do well in their classroom. Implomenting this amazing tehnology into the everyday classroom could help teachers could educate their students better while keeping them engaged.

Having access to information about how the student are responding to a particular activity allow teachers to improve class by keep students engaged.""By weighing the different units the software can even identify mixed emotion""(Alto 5). having the information of a students emotions could prove vital for a teacher by making their job significantly easier. A teacher would easily identify if the students enjoy certain topics or not to help them better prepare for the future. Having emotional feedback from the student can help teachers better prepare students more easily.

With the vital information the facial action coding system provides teachers are now better able to help their students succeed. ""Whoever though that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion""(Alto 9). Having a computer to read a students expressions could drastically make a teachers life easier in the classroom. The everyday teacher would be better equiped to teach their students.

8734c44,"The right of freedom of expression is here to stay. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author Nick D'Alto introduces a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, that enables computers to identify human emotions. D'Alto also cretaes an argument against the usage of technology that reads a person's emotions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Nick D'Alto creates an argument against the usage of technology capable of reading people's emotion by using examples, facts, and comparisons.

The author provides examples to support his argument. In the article the author provides examples to grab the audiences attention, and make them think the same way that he is thinking which is against the usage of technology in classrooms ""a classroom computer could recognize whan a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto). U.S students have the right to express their emotions, and if they are being watched by a computer that tracks down their emotions while they are performing their daily activities, they are going to feel intimidated which means that they will start to hide their feelings from the computer and society. Which leads into another problem ""moving your facial muscles do not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"" (D'Alto). The problem with this technology is that if students start hidding their emotions such as happines, they will start to lose that feeling, which can then lead to greater problems such as conflicts at school, etc.

Facts are used by the author to support his point of view. People need privacy, and by the usage of this technology, their privacy is being disrupted. If a student is trying to express his feelings to someone else, but he can not do that because he is afrad that the computer will give him a warning, he will be force to hide his emotion and not have any communication at all ""most human communication is nonverbal,"" (D'Alto). D'Alto provides the audience with this example to show them that emotions play a fundamental part of communication. The new computer technology emphasizes in the musular actions ""it's all bout those muscular action units."" (D'Alto). If a student is being watched by a computer, and let say that he is really depressed and needs help, but rememberes a joke from las week and laughs for three seconds, the computer will automatically perceive this muscular movement and it will think that the depression is now gone and that the students is perfectly fine. Those type of actions should make the creators of this new technology double-think about what they are about to make, because it can lead to serious problems in the future.

Comparisons are used to create an argument against the new technology. The author provides comparisons to make his argument stronger and try to make the audience agree with his opinion. The new technology will cost the governement and the people thousands of dollars, which can hurt the economy, and this is because people will need to buy the new products ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (D'Alto). The author compares the ordinary computer with the new computer to demonstrate the differences between them, he also puts the audience to think about the changes that people will have to go through in order to install this new technology in their lives. D'Alto also makes comparisons with normal life situations (She's 83 percetn happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No, that's not your science teacher, grading your latest lab assignment."" (D'Alto). The author compares a science teacher grading an assignment with the new computer. The comparison creates a sense of fear because people won't be able to perform their regular day activities without being watched and graded, which is taking away one of the most important rights a human can have which is freedom.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Nick D'Alto creates an argument against the usage of technology capable of reading people's emotion by using examples, facts, and comparisons. The article provides plenty of information for readers to understand the situation and to decide that they should not agree with the idea of using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms to read the emotional expressions of students, because this new technology will prevent students from expressing their deepest feelings with others. The new technology can also cause great misunderstandings between people that could lead to severe consequences, that is why the author creates and argument against the usage of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms.",4,7,0.8013995885848999

now according to the paragraph the machine is supposed to use a 3d computer to model all 44 facial muscles which is called a action unit by using the 6 classified main emotions. which are happiness'fear'surprise'anger'discust'fear'and sadness all of which we all humans feel on a regular basis. i know it seems kind of weird but you know it could actually be useful in the near future like we may be able to use it for interrogation for criminals. the other thing we could do with it is if we evolve as a race we could upgrade our tchnology and be able to detect moods instead of emotions mind blown right i think the future will be pretty cool. the future will be cool because if we were to actually pull that off we could understand each other better this paragraph is about how the facial action coding system can help us in the future. i think it is valuable for crime uses science stuff basically for all proffesions you could even use it for day to day life or for rehab or something i definitely think they should make a mood changer to enhance it.

but as for the emotions i think its just neat and a cool thing to do like in my opinion unless you upgrade it to a mood sensor it's kind of useless and boring and basicaly not valuable. but dont listen to me this is coming from a f foot 10 16 year old so by all means dont let me discourage you i say if you want to do it go for it. i really dont see the use tin class to be honest its more like a toy than a machine i guss its cool for museums to see paintings but thats just my opinion.

But just because you think you know how someone feels doesn´t mean you really know.

If you have a disease or some type of physical trait many don´t have then you may look different then others. Every human is different in many ways.

If we was to bring this into our school and classrooms we would be more likely to suceed because we would know who would really need help and who is getting the topic, some kids in school are to scared or frightened to speak up if they arent getting it because they think it makes them look dumb, but if we was able to use the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) we could simpley find out through their emotions and facial expressions. What it does is it goes off your musclular stucture in your face to tell you, how you are feeling.

First of all by having ""a computer that knows when you're happy or sad,"" you encourage students to repress themselves. If a computer can know when your happy or sad some students may feel as if they need to be happy all the time in order to empress their instructors, and potentially recive a higher grade.

Second of all the very nature of the system is highly flawed. Human beings are exellant at deception and can fake facial expressios, the article dirrectly states this saying, ""putting on a happy face actually works! A renowned drama coach, Constaintin Stanislavsky, had actors carefully reproduce smiline and frowing as a way of creating these emotions on stage."" Students could simply learn how to fake expressions and decive the computer.

Third of all the presise monitoring of human emotions is detrimental to what it means to be Human. Human beings should not be analyzed and ""compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Humans are meant to be talked to and interacted with not monitored and watched by a machine.

The FACS can is a whole new discovery and tool to the psychological world of emotions because it is able recognize and calculate emotions. It is unique because although humans are able to recognize their emotions up to a certain point, they cannot calculate the exact or even the closest approximate to the emotions they feel. That's where the technology is becomes valuable because it has the ability to recognize and calculate the emotions of a human or a photo.

One may argue that the FACS is would not be effective or valuable because it is a programmed and minipualated system. While that may be true, the system is programmed to be as close to the real human facial structure as possible. The 3-D computer model face has 44 major muscles, all of them made to move like real human muscles. The work and credibility of the making of this system is credited largely to Dr. Paul Eckman, the psychologist who created the FACS and classified the six basic emotions. The FACS system can also tell the difference between a forced facial expression, such as a smile, as opposed to an unforced one based on the movement of one's facial structures. Thus, as stated in the article, ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

Nontheless, emotions can be hard to identify since most of them can be nonverbal rather than them being straight forward. Especially when using technology in the classroom, it can be hard for students to explain what the issue is with them trying to get an assignment done. This leads to the point that using the Facial Action Coding System can be beneficial in the classroom by modifying the lesson or program to the each students specific needs.

Now a days more and more classrooms are going one to one meaning using more online tools with technology than textbooks allowing students to get assignments done even when the teacher is not there. Although, this can be tough without having a teacher near by to help the student understand the lesson better; or, the student can be scared to ask the teacher a question making it difficult for the teacher to know, therefore leading to the use of the Facial Action Coding System. As Dr. Huang said in the article, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal... computers need to understand that, too"". With most human communications being nonverbal there leads to the trouble of how a teacher can figure out if the student is having trouble with the assignment, but by having the FACS there would be no problem. The FACS will figure out that the student is looking confused and modify the assignment to be better understanding or show some examples on how to complete it. Correspondingly, another student might be feeling bored because the assignment is too easy for them and so then the FACS can change it to be more challenging for the individual. By being able to modify the assignments this will allow students to understand the lesson plan better causing test score to improve.

The Mona Lisa is one paint that is famous in the world, according to some new computer software can reconise emotions in people, this system is a innovation of Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Beckman and is working with Prof. Nicu Sebe, they will have help from Dr. Paul Eckman institute of Advanced Science at the University of Illinois man, creator crator of FACS.

BODY

This system has some questions that people thikn, howcan a computer recognize subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? Dr. Haung said that the procces begins when the computer structs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then assosiated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" observes Dr. Haung.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Haung predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Most human communication is nonverval, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Haung. According to the Facila Feedback Theory of Emotion, muving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also help to produce them. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the scien of emotions.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion i tink that this program fantastic because can know how we feal, it identify human emotions just looking our face, it is a nice system because i can know if one person that a love is sad, happy, angry, etc. i thik that this system is goin to be important in the future.",2,7,0.8829067349433899
8825d32,"The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a good idea. I think this is a good idea because say a student was having a bad day at school, the computer can tell if you are having a bad day and so the teacher wouldnt ask any questions, try to make you stand infront of the class reading a book or doing a math problem on the board. This technology will help both the student and the teacher have a better and more understanding relationship.

This article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" shows many examples or evidence that support my claim like; "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements--in a real face or in the paited face of the Mona Lisa. Another example supporting my claim is "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This is a great and fun way to use technology, it will help teachers modify their lessons to fit not only the schools need of teaching but the students way of learning. The students will no longer be confused about an assignment instead, they will be able to learn and grow better than if they was in a regular classroom. This is why I think we should have Facial Action Coding System in our classrooms. ",3,7,0.8937141299247742
8850e39,"The old question has finally been answered, ""Was Mona Lisa happy or was she just trying to trick her audience to think that she was."" Now, thanks to technology, we are able to figure out how she actually felt. With hard work and coding computers will be able to tell how people are genuinely feeling. This technology will help in schools, working environments and more, people will be able to tell if someone is feeling upset, depressed, happy, bored or content.

In relation to Mona Lisa, the article explains that she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This shows that the computer is advanced enough to identify emotions of a woman from many centries ago. Due to the study of human anatomy the computer is able classify emotions like ""happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" With normal identification skills if there was a mix of them people could tell exactly how others felt. For instance if someone got 68% sadness, 22% angry and 10% fear, then people could tell that the person needed help, or was not fine like they said they were. If computers with this technology were in schools teachers would be able to tell if there student were okay. Most students say there okay but with this technology we would be able to perceive if people need help or theorpy. It could change the world by helping prevent less suidcides and self harm or peer pressure and bad decisions. Although it seems this technology could only be in sci-fi movies, the article explains that ""It's all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" Even so, with human persection we can not read or figure out everything from people by what they say and how they look but with the extra help from technology we can get even closer. Nick D'Alto confirms that ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politican or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Yes people have study this for a long time but the computer is just as capable without as much time. The computer reads peoples faces by creating a model and comparing it to the same persons face with no emotion and uses knowledge of the face muscles to determine one's emotions.

However, this technology could also do simple things within a class room like tell if a student is confused or bored or tired. In addition to this information from students schools can find what makes students want to get their education and can get them to enjoy and understand it at the same time. Nick D'Alto claims that ""Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Accordingly, with teachers and technology working together it could improve schools for students and teachers.

With this technology it could help overall morality and acedimics within classes. It could also help human communication, and get people and computers to work together more than before.     ",4,7,0.7790584564208984
8893b2c,"The years seem to by flying by, people seem to be growing smarter, and technology seems to be improving rather well. Smart products are becoming more and more popular in some countries, and students in school are using technology often. Psychologists all over the world are studying why students and young adults need a program to help others understand their emotions. Systems like the Facial Action Coding System is showing people why emotions are important in peoples' everyday lives, especially in schools. Helping the students around the world is important, and the facial coding on computers can detect when a student is bored, confused, or worried.

When a student is falling bored in class, it can be hard to tell what is going on. They may not be paying attention and the teacher may not even know what the problem is. The Facial Action Coding System will come in handy; computers will be able to easily detect when a student is falling out of focus. Helping out students pay attention is important to their education, and the facial coding is high programmed algorithms to detect the facial muscles on a student. This program is accurate and quick to decide what the student is feeling in class. The passage, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" mentions when a student is falling bored, the program that recognizes the students face can update to show information that interests the child.

Aside from students falling bored in school, The Facial Action Coding System can come in handy for recognizing students becoming confused also. There are different facial muscles used for confusion, worry, surprise, and happy, so the coding system can help students who become easily confused. Dr. Huang and his colleague Nicu Sebe are working to help computers and humans to communicate, without the confusion. The computer system can update its information to help the students by constructing a 3-D scan of the face, becuase it can be confusing trying to figure out what the student is confused about. This system can then modify its lesson to help the student become less confused, like said in, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile.""

When talking about emotions, worry and surprise go hand in hand. Worry is easily detected by the Facial Action Coding System that Dr. Paul Eckman created. A person's frontalis pars laterlis muscle is above the eyes and falls the category of worry and surprise. When a student appears to be worried, or shocked over a subject, the computer program can adjust and help the teacher figure out what the student is struggling with. A program that does not help a student can be detrimental, that is why the Facial Action Coding System will come in handy to easily detect the students' feelings.

The idea behind the Facial Action Coding System is that a computer scan of a person's face will be used to decide the person's emotion. When someone is angry, their orbicularis oris tightens around the mouth. This muscle will be detected on the Facial Action Coding System, as all the 44 major muscles will be modeled on the program. It is helpful to know when someone is angry or feeling down, and this system is extremely helpful for students. ",5,7,0.8387662172317505
88a1205,"The Facial Action Coding System is a very useful tool used to help tell what other peoples emotions are just by their facial expresions. Having this technology can be very helpful in the classrom. It can help define the mixed emotions of a student, how they feel of a topic they are learning, and if a student is telling the truth.

The first reason as to why this technology is useful in the classroom is defineing the mixed emotions of students. In the artical it says ""The software can even identify mixed emotions"" (paragraph 4). Being able to identify mixed emotions of a student can be helpful. Sometimes a student may be stressed and upset over something, making it hard for them to concentrate on their work. You can't just let them not work though, but knowing their feelings you may be able to take it more slow paced for them that day. The student may have felt angry and stressed before they came into class, explaining why they got so upset when they couldn't find their homework.

Another reason this would be useful in class is by defining how they feel about a topic in class. In this article it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" (paragraph 6). Having this tool say when they are confused is extraemly helpful. It lets the teacher know they may need some extra help, and the computer know to explain things in a different way. When a student becoms bored of what they are doing it becomes hard for them to concentrate, or causes them to want to rush through.

The final reason Facial Action Coding Systems should be in classrooms is because it can help tell when a student is lying. In paragraph 8 of the article it says ""Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This can help a teacher know when an anxious student needs help, but says they don't. Some students may be too anxious to actually speak up when they need help, causing them to lie when a teacher ask them if they do. This also comes in handy when a student has done something and no one knows who it was, like tearing down a poster or putting a tac on the teachers seat.

In conclusion, this technology would be very useful for classrooms to define a students emotions to improve work, help a confused or bored student, and spot out lairs.",5,7,0.8762151598930359
88a9a8d,"The Facial Action Coding System is a new form of technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Will the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable? No. "" FACS"" will not be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. A theory and technology such as emotions and the emotional state of someone should be based off of science instead of being based off opinion. Take a minute and compare this new piece of technology to a quiz given on the internet to see what celebrity I would be. Moral of the story if the person can fake it, they can make it. Someone can make believable facial expressions all day does not mean they are happy, sad, or any other emotion based on what they look like. A student may come in looking grumpy does not mean they are grumpy, maybe just maybe have you ever thought. "" WOW, that just might be their natural facial expression."" To end with, unless this technology is enhanced and backed up with science instead of opinion I do not think it will be very dependable in determing the emotional expressions of students.

88b0a4f,"In the article "" Making mona lisa smile"" the author describes how a new tecnology called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The real question is does this have a value in the set of a classroom? If you think about what this would do for the rest of the world it is great but would it be good in school classroom? In the school teachers know if you are confused or mad they see you expresion on your face. Teachers are in the classroom to help you understand and learn what is being teached to you.

One of the many reasons why the facial acting coding systeam technology is not a valueable in a classroom is because it does not help when you are given an assignment on paper and a book and if you are confused you ask a teacher to help you a technology will not help you solve the confusen it will just tell you are confused. Another reson is it is very unuseful to what you do during school hours because you work durning school hours that does not help the work ethic you put into your education. Lastly it does not help you graduate if you use a facial action coding systeam it justa systeam that you can have fun with and know how you are feeling.

The Facial Action Coding System is a usless system that does not help you growth in learning in school. You do not need it to graduate to the next grade. Also it does not help you to use it if you have a question on an assignment , homework or test that is what a teacher is for to help you solve your questions.

The Facial Action Coding System just scans your face and tells you if you are happy, sad, mad, scared or any other word to desrible your express. This system is a usless system and should not be in a classroom.",3,7,0.8406117558479309
88bcf3f,"Emotional expresions of students in a classroom are valuable because they show what they feel, as well as actons do. It would be awesome if this creations would be created because when a student is bored, their face will change they way of a lesson if needed.

Studens emotions are valuable because they express how we feel, like if friend dies, our face will show that we are sad. If we do great on something, like winning a contest, our face will show that we are happy. Our teenage years are the most important because we have alot of different emotions, that change our lives.

Another reason that students emotions are valuable is becease we are growing up. Growing up is hard for parents, but it is hard for the kids too, they have to deal with the parents strict rules. Emotions are what makes you, me , and everyone else. Our emotions tell us who we are, what we like, how we feel.

Emotions make character in every circumstance.

The text states "" For instance, you can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on their face."" We have 44 muscles that make us unique, but they all show the same emotion. We can try to hide our emtion, but there will always be one person who can tell what emotions you are really feeling, that person is you, your parents. When you make a certan face, only you know that feeling at the moment.

If you have real freinds they bring you up when your down, only because they see your emotions.

In conclusion student emotions are valuable because, emotions make character, they also change lives, they make you, you. and they leave an impact. they show what you feel. They also show if you disagree with something. Those 44 muscles in your face makes you unique, nothing can change that, thats the best part, God made no mistakes, he made you in his image. People try to hide their depression, when they do it gets worse, only because they didn't tell anybody. Your emotions as a student can either make or break you in life when you get older, its all in your face.      ",2,7,0.67880779504776

Another thing it could be valuable for is how a students is feeling lso like if the system see's that a student is feeling unhappy the system could tell the teacher or another student that this student is not in a good mood and that they might need some to go chcek on them.

So those are the resion's why I think the Facial Action Coding System would be valuble in classroom's is that it could tell if a student is having a hard time doing the work or just does not like the work they are doing and another thing is that it could help the teacher or other stundet's know that one of the stundet's is unhappy and that they might need someone help like they are haveing a bad day or they are feeling sick.

8936c5c,"Professors Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe collaborated to develop a unique method of determining human emotions using computer algorithms. After a process of 3-D modelling and calculations of muscle movements, emotion of a face can be determined with the help of Da Vinci's depiction of the human anatomy used in the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) algorithms. However, the main picture at hand is whether or not this highly sophisticated program is necessary at all in the real world, especially in a school classroom. The enabling of computers to be able to identify human emotion can in fact be used in classrooms and can be of great benefit to the student and other people in the area.

Firstly, according to Dr. Huang, when a classroom computer recognizes by their facial expression that a student may not be very interested in the lesson or seems utterly confused, the computer can modify its lesson and perhaps recommend the student other lessons that may be more beneficial. This in turn can give the student the luxury of exiting their state of confusion and begin to understand lessons and topics that was not well introduced by the teacher. Additionally, this could impact the student's grade and boost it greatly, all with the help of some complex algorithms.

In addition to the aforementioned about lesson modification, computers can also detect your emotion and influence different types of ads that can pop up on the screen. For example, if the computer recognizes a student has a happy face for a particular ad, a more similar ad can pop up to keep your emotion. However, if the computer recognizes that the student's emotion is sad, the next ad will be different (potentially more optomistic) in order to influence a different emotion to the student.

Thirdly, just making facial expressions to the computer, whether it be real or fake, can have multiple influences to other people in the area. Constantin Stanislavsky, a drama coach, had his actors smile and frown in a certain way to create emotion on the stage and for the audience. In relation to the FACS, when a student is for instance ""testing"" their emotions on the computer screen, a person may look up and notice his classmate frowning at the screen and in turn have a similar effect on them. Just by making simple facial expressions can effect another person and influence their emotional status too.

In conclusion, the input of emotion-recognizing computers throughout a school can have a multitude of effects on a student and the people around him/her. These include having a very own built-in instructor in the computer which can guide the student through course lessons not effectively explained by their teacher, advertisements shown on the web that can change itself based on recognition of certain facial expressions, and all-in-all influence the emotional status of people around the student. The input of the FACS program can have a positive impact on personal relations with other people and can even help give a grade booster! ",4,7,0.8561321496963501
894060d,"For many years, there has been a disconnection between students and teachers; part of this is due to the fact that some students simply just do not like the taching methods of the teachers they have been assigned to, but what if that could change. Recently, a new technology has been developed that is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology enables computers to identify a variety of human emotions. This system could accomplish many great things. If used in schools as personal tutors for students, many things could change for the better.

Imagine getting an A+ on every single one of your geometry quizzes because you actually knew what was going on. If the Facial Action Coding System is incorporated into a tutoring program, this could enhance the students knowledge of their prefered learning styles. If a student is learning a lesson in a class and FACS picks up that the student is not enjoying the way it is being taught to them or simply looks disinterested, FACS could continue to bring the lesson to the student until the student looks satisfied. The student would finally understand how to solve something in a way that they like meaning this would be a win for both the school and the student. This is just one of many ways that FACS could be used in classrooms across the world, potentially enhancing them.

With the evedince shown above, it has been shown how useful it would be to incorporate a Facial Action Coding System in schools. It would be a smart choice to have something that connects with a students emotions when it comes to learning something new. This would not only mean a higher success rate for schools, but also the student would be satisfied in knowing that they understand how to do certain things that they did not prior to FACS.",3,7,0.8014408946037292

With the Facial Action Coding System you could know how your students feel about projects, assignments, and assignments on computers and laptops.

With this you can have their face scanned to find out their emotions and know how they feel about the things you are doing in class.

The FACS can even scan people faces from pictures. The FACS was created by Dr. Paul Eckman.

Dr. Paul Eckman coded the Facial Action Coding System with six basic emotions, happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The FACS was used to scan the Mona Lisa and it was said that she was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent distgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The FACS uses a 3-D computer model of the face which has all 44 major muscles in the model. People observe these muscles to be able to tell whether or not somone is being truthful or isn't being truthful. These muscle clues are used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.

The FACS would be very valuable to students in the classroom mainly because if a student were getting bored or unamused on an online assignment then there could be a program that will change the lesson up and go about teaching it a different way that is more interesting, fun, and how the students will like it.",2,7,0.8332381844520569

The facial emotion detection technology is useful because, the software could use pictures of students faces to let the teacher know who is confused, who understands and who is bored.

The facial emotion technology will allow teachers who have confused students to better learn by letting the teacher know that students are struggling so that the teacher can help the students on a more one to one level. This technology allows students who are normally scared to ask questions or that are very shy to not drop behind the rest of the class when they do not understand what is going on.

The emotion detection technology can help the teacher know when the class as a whole understands a subject so that they can teach in a more efficient way. The technology is helpful because, it lets the teacher know when to move on from one subject or problem to another. This is more efficient because, If a problem is understood by the class then the teacher may not even bother asking for a solution to the problem which, saves time for more important subjects or, gives more time to areas where more students are struggling.

The emotional detection software can let the teacher know when the class is bored and when they are interested in the subject, this is helpful because, the teacher can learn; how the class as a whole learns best, how to teach in a way that gets students attention and, get everyone in the class the best and most enjoyable education the teacher is able to provide.

In conclusion, In Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D' Alto the technology that was able to determine the emotions of Mona lisa the famous paining is helpful in the classroom because; It lets teachers know when students are falling behind, how to be more a more efficient classroom and how to provide the students with a more enjoyable and useful education.

Secondly, the FACS is also helpful becasue it can tell if we are forcing a smile or not. FInally, this also can tell if people like an ad by just smiling and also tell if we dislike an ad if

people frown. In Leonardo da Vinci's renaissance painting of the Mona Lisa, computers have already found out that she was putting a forced smile .

In the painting of Mona Lisa, reserchers have calculated the emotions of the drawing. ""Mona Lisa was only' 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery""(1). According to the FACS software. Then we can calculate the emotions of people by just looking at the gesters one person makes. ""...

If you smile when a Web ad appearson your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffent""(6). These are examples of how the FACS can be valuable in the classrooms.

Readers may say that FACS can not work in a normal computer. According to this research, it states that, ""Your home PC can not handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile""(7).

An aplication that is used purely for the purpose of reading emotions is usless, due to the fact that we humans can already read each others emotions quite effectively. It is also not valueble because the system reads facial cues and might make a false judgement on a person's actual emotions. Finally, it's unrealistic because it would cost insane amounts of money to upgrade everyone's computer to the quality required to run a system as complex as the Facial Action Coding System.

First and foremost, humans can read other human's emotions without the help of a computer. Since the dawning of time, people have looked at another person's face and been able to tell what they are feeling; why, suddenly, do we need a computer to decipher emotions for us? In paragraph five in the text, the author says, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probobly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."", this quote clearly implies that humans can read each other's emotions very well. After all, why would it be called ""human emotion"" if humans couldn't understand it.

Secondly, the computer could make a false judgement. Not all emotions are outward, some we keep on the inside and never show anyone. Some emotions, like anger, can be expressed through a smile or by crying.

Finally, the Facial Action Coding System is usless because it's unrealistic. As seen is paragraph seven when the author says, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."", the system is very complex. It's clear that it would cost outrageous ammounts of money to upgrade everyone's software to the level required to run a sophisticated system like FACS.

I would assert to you that FACS is a waste of time and money because it's faulty, it's unneeded, and it comes with an unrealistic price tag.

If you are frowning then you are angry or sad. If you were to be smiling you would be excited or happy. People love showing expression to a lot of things and we can be able to recognize it just by looking at them.

Sometimes you just can't seem to understand someone's expression. A lot of times you won't be able to understand what is going on with someone. Sometimes the answer is within the person's facial muscles You could try asking if they are okay, but their facial expression might be a truthful answer.

According paragraph 8, ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a

Luckily for everyone around the world it is about to change. Technology is a humongous part of our lives right?

Nicu made this really cool software called the Facial Action Coding System. Calculating emotions is diferent from coding your face with a 3-D mode of your face that could barely even look like you. Plus there are more than the basic six emotion everbody has. It is still a very cool idea but not for us students.

Dr. Huang said that every facial emotion is universaly the same in paragraph 4, but some people can feel emotions without making that facial emotion on thier face. This software can be an evasion of privacy for students who would not like to be disterb by this software showing it to your teacher and then the teacher would call or give you a private lesson in school. Mixed emotions are even more complecated for the software to know. There are 44 major muscles in our faces are realy cool but, technology is not yet advanced for this to be true. And the Mona Lisa could just be happy.

How can this ""Facial Action Coding System"" even tell the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy. The technology is not advance enough to say what emotions we have. How can this software even know the emotions we have on a picture. The Mona Lisa is a painting not a picture, so that cannot be corect. Da Vinci Code is something different from Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms. Communication doesn't have to do anything with the software, but maybe us the students.

And finaly this stuff can't be used in public, who is going to use this sofware than the school. Video games are mostly the freedom of choice for most people . And emotional communication will still need to wait for technology to advance. Who is even gona use this. People do not caare what think about us the students. Making privat lessons based on our faces isn't a good idea. Many bad culd use this software to invade privacy from others.

And this is my reasons why I think this software sucks and should never be used.",3,7,0.9100921154022217

Students could be fake smiling and actually be derpressed and we won't know it. What if there is something wrong with the student. We could ask or help out the student and hopefully help them out. We do not know how the other student feels we can not tell if something is wrong if we just look at them. In the passage it says "" For instancem you can probably tell how friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried ect."" This technology that we had come upon can calculate every muscle in your face. 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

8ab44d2,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think the Facial Action Coding System technology that allows computers to read emotions could be valuable to students in a classroom.

One of the ways this technology could be valuable is because it would help students who are confused or bored, like Dr. Huang predicts,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" That would be valuable because students are sometimes afraid to ask for help so the computer could either inform the teacher or provide extra information to the student that needs it.

Another way that technology in a classroom could be valueable to students is because it could give teachers feedback on how their students are liking the assignment. If the students become bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicted, ""Then it could modify the assignment, like an effective human instructor."" So that would give the teacher feedback of how their students are liking the assignment. Then they could modify the assignment to be more enjoyable or less confusing for the students if needed.

The Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions could be valuable to a classroom for many reasons. It could help students that are confused on an assignment by reading the student's face to see if they are confused. It could also give teachers feedback on how their students are enjoying the assignment. If the students aren't enjoying the assigment or are confused the computers could inform the teacher. The teacher then could modify the assignment to make it less confusing and more enjoyable for the students. Those are some of the reasons why that type of technology could be valuable to students in a classroom. ",3,7,0.8776916265487671

Because I think we all fakes our smiles sometimes, let's say that I don't feel good or I am angry, but I don't anyone or anybody to know how I feel because I am pretty sure not everyone of us is always ready to let people know how they are feeling, we fake our smile and still smile but we don't really mean it, we smile out side but we feel like crying inside, and most of the time if you come out and say how you are feeling no one will notice it except if you tpld them yourself, so what I am trying to say is that a computer cannot tell whether a person is happy, sad, fear,angry. and in the second paragraph it says that we or computer can ""calculate"" our emotions and I still don't believe that can ever happen because we express how we feel we can't count our emotions.

""Hold on! can we actually ""calculate"" emotions-like math homework? And how can a computer reconize the subtle facial movement we humans use to express how we feel?""

8ac535b,"The idea of new technology that can read your facial expressions to know how you're feeling sounds incredible. Who knew that technology could get this advanced. The idea of this technology does not bother me if it were to be used in classrooms. The computer could not just be used in school classrooms but can also be used for crime solving when the detective is trying to interogate a suspect or the actual crime commiter.

This computer can be used very effectively with friends or family. If you can suspect something is wrong with someone and you want to help them you can use this technology in order to help them or comfort them. If your friend or sibling acts like they are fine but when you use the computer and you realize they are sad or mad you can help them with their problems. A big problem in the world right now are students who are sad or depressed and dont open up to people and then they tend to be alone. This technology can help those who are in need and then counseling or just friends and family come into the picture to help those who are alone.

The computer was programmed to detect the little thigs that describe how our facial expressions would be like for every emotion. Expert say that the muscles around our face tend to move differently for each of our expressions but its hard to tell if you arent an expert because we tend to be decieved. Someone could be completely depressed but when in person they are the happiest person to you and are so possitive.

This technology only seems to have a possitive future is its already invented. Maybe sometimes it will calculate a persons a emotions sometimes but that can always be fixed by the manufacturers. Later on this could be used on phones to maybe but the camera of the phones will need to be changed in order to detect perfect muscles in your face.

8b33cfe,"The question is, for this advanced time period in the new discovery of technology being able to identify humans emotions, a good thing or bad? Well to simple start off my opinion to this idea, no; I don't agree with the new advancement of technology distinguishing humans emotions being good.

I don't agree with technology telling an individuals emotions, that being said; the reason why is because humans sound either already know or learn to identify how someone is feeling by the look on someones face theirself. Humans are capable of doing so. The technology, as explained in the story, looks at the forming of your lips, the squint near your eyes, your cheeks, and youre eyes themselves. All of which a human can do theirself.

The question in the article asks, ""Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"" In my opinion yes it does, expression is the number one thing that deals with emotion. It's shown in the face, goes to every indent and wrinkle and mark in your face. It can be distinguished easily by the human eye evern if the emotion is trying to be hiden.

Although the counterargument is, the humans can't identify emotion from the face muscles, i could disagree with that aslo because the face msucles is what produces the expression, the muscles move your smile up, your cheeks more purky, to seem more happy and or sad. Muscles are the first step to identifying visually how a person is feeling which doesn't exactly need a technilogical discoverance.

With all that i have said, I simply think the world using technology on something so silly is a waste, humans should practice identifying those things personally and it is a good skill to learn in the real world. I disagree and I think the reasoning is valid. Technology shouldn't take basic emotion reading abilities.    ",3,7,0.7190427780151367
8ba4781,"Making Mona Lisa Smile the authour describes how new technology called The Facial Action Coding System Enables computers to identify human emotions. The process beging when the computer constructs A 3-D, Eckman has classified six basic emotions, The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.

Why I disagree with the authour is because you can't tell people emotions even with the computers. In the story its says that ""The process beging when the compputer constructs A 3-D Computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the modle must move like humans muscles""(3). A human can move there face in many different ways even if there sad they can have a happy look on there face if the happy they could have a sad look on they face. So what this proves is that computer try to tell your emotions by your face expresions but really can't.

Humans have a lot of emotions some you can see and some you can not see but all humans have there main emotions. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles""(3). So what this is saying is that your main emotions can be known by a computer because you so different expressions when you are in them emotions. But even if you are show different emotions it would still be hard for a computer to tell how you fell even if it was the smartest computer in the world because say you are mad but even know your mad you showing expressions of being happy so what would the computer say it would most likely say your happy even know your not.

Everybody show there facial expressions for each emotion. in the story it says that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes DR Hunang, even thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling a broadly""(4). And what that is saying is that when you are happy you show a facial expressions or even sad or depressed. Some people do show a lot of emotions but somepeople dont could make it harded for a computer to read if your happy are not.

So what I have proven in The process beging when the computer constructs A 3-D, Eckman has classified six basic emotions, The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. Is that computer would not be a very good way of reading people emotions. Because have there own way of showing the feelings and emotions so show heavy emotions some show light emotions.

With FACS (Facial Action Coding System) there is new wonder to the system everyday. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, D'Alto describes the many ways a computer system can benefit learning styles of students by using examples of FACS: classroom computers, complex algorithms, and 3D models created by computers.

Classroom computers may seem like a boring and old piece of machinery to most students. Although classroom computers are not that exciting, students can have a great benefit from the technology that can be accessed from the computers. Students might not be able to notice any difference in the computer's hardware. However, they may be confused when they see certain ad's showing up depending on their facial expressions. A student's facial recognition can be very important when encouraging students to learn ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto). Classroom computers being able to read facial recognition helps students' lessons become modifyed to help their learning experience.

Complex algorithms can help a computer detect facial structures and emotions portrayed from within an individual. With technology becoming more efficient in the daily live of an average person, some computers are now built with sensors that can be used to unlock the device. Some home computers; however, are not able to ""handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. But we can write down some simple instructions that 'encode' different emotions"" (D'Alto). Software engineers, computer engineers, etc. are working nonstop to help write certain codes that will help create features that will be able to sensed. This big leap into technology can help when classroom computers are being built, thus helping student to learn better.

3D models created by computers are something individuals normally wouldn't see on a day-to-day basis. 3D models are usually created to help people working in the medical fields determine certain diagnosis and such with individuals. If a patient is getting a scan and the doctors need to see certain muscles ""the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto). With computers being able to read and detect muscles located in a person's face, engineers can use that research to help enhance the function of computers being able to sense facial expressions.

The use of FACS examples: classroom computers, complex algorithms, and 3D models created by computers can all make an impact in a student's learning style in the passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto. The use of technolgy used today's society already has a huge impact that can lead to an even bigger impact and that impact can help many young individuals learn specific and various ways.

The new tool would help increase teachers knowledge of students to a whole new level.

Emotions in the classroom affect the students ability to learn. Lessons are fit to help a student succeed in school. The detection of a student's emotion enables teacher's ability to customize their lesson plans based on the emotion students are portraying. In paragraph five it states,""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc,"" proving although humans may have the ability to read emotions to an extent, computers have the ability to exactly calculate the emotion. It provides an extra tool that would benefit the way teachers teach in their classroom's.

The calculation of a student's emotion would allow for classrooms to be more efficient. Time is a crucial factor when it comes to the amount students learn. Emotion ties into the mood of a human. The mood a student has can cause an increase or decrease in the amount of new information he or she can take in. The calculation of emotion can provide the teacher with information on how it may affect their attention span. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions,""which would better the teacher, leading to a better classroom.

Emotions can be hard to read. All teachers are differernt and read emotions differently. Facial Action Coding System would be of great value in the classroom.

The first reason that the FACS system is valuable is that it could help students learn. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang when he says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it coud modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(D'Alto 6). This technology would make sure that every student has the help they need if they are confused. D'Alto also says ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive -- for video games or video surgury""(D'Alto 6). The FACS could be used for medical training as well as every day learning.

Secondly, the FACS could be used for politics. In the article D'Alto states "" The can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.""(D'Alto 7). This applies to politics, because politions who are ingenuine would be easily caught. D'Alto furthurs this thinking by saying ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" polititian or celeberty isn't being truthful.""(D'Alto 8). This shows that this field of study is already applied to politics, but that the FACS will only inporove our ability spot the fakers.

Lastly, this technology could be used for entertainment purposes. D'Alto mentions that mimicking facial expression is used in the acting world. D'A;to say that an acting coach has his actors ""carefully reproduce smiling and frowning faces as a way of creating these emotions on stage.""(D'Alto 9). The FACS could help these actors more accuratly display the emotions their characters are feeling. Another way D'Alto says FACS could impove entertainment is by saying ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games""(D'Alto 6). Making the characters in video games more expressive would have the same affect as making actors expressions more accurate. It creates a sense of realism and emersion to the audience, thus inproving the experience as a whole.

In conclusion I believe the FACS system could be very valuable in many ways.

The tecnology could help the student becuase it tells them whenthey are looking bored or sleepy. Dr. Huang is predicing that the tecnology could have a ""effective human instructor"" the tecnogly is very smart it could also make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. In the passage they gave an example of a real face painted of ""Mona Lisa"" becuase in the picture she has a stright face and she shows ""no emotion"". But it is also made to put a smile on your face.

The computer model of the face technology has to have a 3D face model and has to have ""all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Humans ""preform the same impressive calcualtion everday"". everybody had diferent facal expressions.

In conclusion the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in the classroom is valialbe becuase they all need to know how there emotions are and how they are looking in a classroom or jsut on the daily basic.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human motions. How people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions. In the smile of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Felt the experince of ""The Mona Lisa demostration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"".

People are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions because in a new technology can describe the human motions. They know that the painting of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted they calculate the facial expressions for each emotion universal. The motions of any students in a clasroom computer are confused or bored. In the painting many know the feeling motions of her smile but have 83 percent happy in her smile.

In the painting of Mona Lisa is 6 percent fearfun and 2 percent angry. This is painting to recorgnize for many people in all the world, because is an painting of Leonardo da Vinci's. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games to learn more about the motions of people. An example of the text is ""Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vanci Code"".

The theory of motion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. The Mona Lisa demostration expression is really intended to bring a smile to your face. The new motion-recognition sofware tracks these facial basic motions are happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. The facial emotions for universal to many students want to investige the painting of Mona Lisa. Many use the same techonology for conclude the different motions of the painting. The students can talk about the experince of the Mona Lisa demostration of her emotions about a painting very good.

In conclusion the author describes a new technology called ""The Facial Action Coding System"". Because the technology help to know the emotional expressions to students. The painting of Mona Lisa is very famous in the world however many students can use the new technology to learn more about the human motion.             ",1,7,0.6945750713348389
8d678bc,"Use of FACS in the Classroom

Isn't it just the worst when you're frustrated with your homework, but your teacher doesn't seem to get the hint? This is why the Facial Action Coding System was created, or partly. The Facial Action Coding System would indeed be valuable if used in a classroom. It could be useful to kids, teachers, and parents of students. The FACS would be useful to change course of the lesson, or to help teachers decide on lesson plans for following years.

The FACS uses it's technology to evaluate the expression of Mona Lisa-- a painting. If the machine can figure out a non-living painting's emotion, then what could it do on humans? The FACS focuses on facial muscle movements to interpret the emotion of each item it scans. In the classroom, this could help kids by determining whether they understand. If a kid frowns, it can be obvious to the internet instructor that the student isn't understanding what they're being taught. The instructor can then go into deeper detail on how to finish a homework assignment.

In the case of boredom, it can help increase average scores. The software can determine whether a student is bored or not. If a student is bored, they will not pay much attention to the lesson, fall asleep, or maybe even shut it off. It is important to make sure the students are having some sort of fun with what they're being taught. The software could detect boredom and the online instructor would know to put more animations in the lesson, or even change the sounds and add music or a new polytone voice.

This software can also identify mixed emotions. If a student somewhat understands a lesson, but is also bored with it, the instructor knows to create a more lively detailed presentation. It's important to have a reader of mixed emotions in a classroom because of the amount of uncertainty in student's minds. It can also help the instructor know what lessons students understand and which ones they don't. The teachers can then decide what to do from then on, and/or next year, which ways the kids learn and which ways they don't.

The FACS is valuable in the classroom because teachers can change their lessons to fit each kids needs, and change their lessons for the following students next year. Each kid has their own personality, which requires different ways of learning. This software can almost guarantee improved scores in homework and tests because of how it helps teachers determine what the kids don't understand. Having the FACS in the classroom would deeply benefit the students, teachers, and parents. It would be the smartest choice to include this system into every student computer.",4,7,0.8045153617858887

First reason, its valuable because it shows creativity. You can use it while making a game. For those people who like to make animation movies, you can use it to change the character's face. This can make the audience understand the character's expression by seeing them happy, angry and etc. The students can use this for those who like to make video games or make animation movies in the future.

Second reason, the Facial Action Coding System tells you the percentage of their emotion. You can see it by scanning their face and you'll be able to see the percentage of their emotion. You'll see their mix emotions like excited, upset, content and etc. This can be a fun thing to do with the students. They can go around and see their friend's emotions and see how they feel.

Third reason, is when you know your friend is not fine but they said that they are, you can check by using the technology, Facial Action Coding System, to see their actual emotions. You can see how your friend truly feels. This technology is absolutely amazing because how it can change your expression. The students would probably think that this technology is truly valuable.

Last reason, is it's fun to play with. Nowadays, there are apps that can change your emotion. Students can use this and have fun with it. Also the technology, Facial Action Coding System, is much better than the app. It actually show you the percentage on how that person feels.

This is how the technology, Facial Action Coding System, is valuable to use at students in a classroom.",3,7,0.8271685838699341
8e1c0ef,"Throughout the years, computers and other technological devices have become very developed. Due to this, human interactions have lessened due to advancements in social media and other technologies. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions through the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This system can help build the computer's capacity to understand human emotions in which benefits to humans through the comprehesion of their emotions can occur, like students in a classroom. The author of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto, gives a couple reasons why the FACS technology can be useful for students in a classroom: helping students to understand difficult topics and helping students to connect with the computer in order to learn more efficiently.

The use of the new FACS technology is valuable to the students in a classroom due to the student's understanding of a difficult or confusing topic. In the article, Dr. Huang, a college professor at the University of Illinois who is working on the development of the FACS technology with another professor, explains, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto). With computers understanding the emotional expressions of students during their comprehension of difficult or confusing topics, the help students gain will help them to learn more efficiently and become a better, smarter generation of students and adults.

Another reason why the use of the human emotion indentifying technology is valuable for students in a classroom is that the student may have a better comprension of topics when connected to the computer. It is known by many people that all students do not learn the same way because our minds are not the replicas of one another. Some students may learn better when working hands-on; other students may learn better visually with pictures; many more students may learn better when typing or writing down their notes neatly. Even though there are countless ways a student can learn, the environment in which a student works and learns in may not be suitable for their style of learning. Some teachers may want all their students to take hand written notes, yet some students have to type their notes. Though, the use of the FACS technology can help the students who need to communicate with the computer along with getting a better understanding of the topic at hand, and now that ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...computers need to understand that, too"" (D'Alto). Students being able to learn better with their desired style of writing and the computer being able to comprehend and analyze the student's emotions can help students struggling in their classes to work harder and improve daily.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto, the author, explains how helping students understand difficult topics and helping students connect with the computer to efficiently learn topics with the new Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can be useful and valuable for students in a classroom. As society continues to grow--with the technologies and machines--the students of the newer generation have to keep up with the constantly improving machines in order to be successful. This seems impossible because the rate at which society and the world is improving is at a speed that seems impossible to keep up with, so improving computers and other machines to help improve the rate at which students can grow and learn can possibly help the future generation of adults to be successful in a world full of metal, SD cards, and algorithms.

There is the FACS( Facial Action Coding System) , this alones people to see the mood of there faces by just scanning them. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a classroom is valuable because it shows what the students are feeling, why they are showing the mood, and what other moods they are felling in there mindes.

this is valuable to students because it shows how they are feeling. when it comes to something that they know that isn't right they will show there feeling for it, but they dont show there ture emotions to the problem in hand. in paragraph 3 of Making Mona Lisa Smile, it states,"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fera, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the tacial muscles."" find out that there was six different types of emotion is a lot to give a perosn, most likrly these student will use all six of there emotions.

8e88719,"The question is, is this technology valuable to telling what a student in a classroom is feeling? Can it actually tell how someone is feeling by their facial expression? I think, no. I mean what is the big deal here? They can't actually tell what a person is feeling, right? Well I for sure do not think so.

Of course you can look at someone and think they are sad by what they are saying or how they look, but they can obviously be acting like that to hide the fact that they are happy. Or the oppostie. Many, many people hide that they are sad with a big smile on their face. I just think this technology is pointless because people hide their emotions all the time. I know I do.

For example, say you are at a family get together, and you feel unhappy about something, but your mom wants to take a family photo. You're going to smile in the picture but that does not neccisarily mean you feel happy. Or for a school picture. You could be upset about something but of course you are not going to show that in a picture everyone is going to see. And why would you use the painting of Mona Lisa as an example. It is a painting! She might be smiling becasue that is how the artist wanted her to look but she doesn't feel that way!

""Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"".

But I feel they should take it a little more exstreme for things like could also have audio and could really help with peoples lives. Not even the bad emotions if you are happy or exicted it can sense that and something good could happen.

One reason I believe this would work because there is so much danger and anything can happen and we could use extra protection. But I also feel that it could be more to it then just looking for emotions. Even if they are good emotions there should be something to say or something should light up when the senseor feels that you are happy.

They should test it out and see how it goes and turns out for some people and if things go good the they should move it to the next step and add audio and see how much it makes a impact on peoples lifes.

Another reason I feel that it might work is because sensing peoples emotions is great. Peoples emotions shows alot it can say so much about their personality or how they feel about life, it could even gives you signs about that person and could get people aware so they can put thst person in a safe place if they need to. There should also be bounderies because most people arn't gonna want a computer screen or phone screen watching them, their emotions or even listening to them. But to even fix that you could always have were you could turn the senseor on an off just so people could feel more surcure.

Overall my thought about the Facial Action Coding System is great. You can take it so far and you can keep it how it is. Even if graphing shows that people don't like it I still think it is a good idea for me thinking saftey wise.

8f7be0a,"Professor Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois has made a great leap in technology that can recognize the emotions one might project. With his collegues, Prof. Huang developed the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. It utilizes human anatomy to help indentify the intensity of emotions and what range of emotions one might feel. As facial emotions are universal in the muscles that are engaged to produce those emotions, having this technology in different environments can help with productivity and learning. An application of FACS can prove useful in a school enviroment, as it can provide tailored learning, emotional aid through school counseling, and can aid in learning anatomy.

As proposed in paragraph 6, the use of FACS can allow for tailored learning through webcamera software. If the software can be used to detect the emotions on the faces of students, it can identify the emotions associated with success and frustration. If the facial scan sees that a student is struggling with an assignment or is frustrated with it, the lesson plan and the problems given can be altered to maximize what is learned as mentioned in paragraph 6 with Prof. Huang writing, ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This application can aid struggling students and familiarize students with the given material, meaning that the students can further comprehend the lesson given. For students are exceeding the requirements for the assignment, emotions of happiness could allow for students to face a challenge with tougher problems than the ones given previously.

As seen in the paragraph above, FACS can aid in online learning, but it can also help with emotional help provided by a school counselor. Though it is a profession that entails the analysis of emotion in teenagers, emotions can be tough to read for even the most experienced in the field. FACS could play a big role in identifying what emotions students might have in the name of bettering their life. As mentioned in paragraph 5, humans can differentiate between various emotions when looking at the face of an friend or family member. However, the length of that analysis can only go so far to prove what a student is feeling. Employing FACS could help counselors talk one on one with students about what problems they face in school and at home. Talking through these problems can lead to a more positive outlook on life and could allow for more engagement academically regarding the student. As a whole FACS can improve school life and culture.

Lastly, FACS can play a large role in the education of Anatomy, not only in high school, but in college as well. Paragraphs 7-9 provide simple examples of muscles involved in movements that indicate emotions from the zygomatic major and risorius to the orbicularis oculi pars plpabraeus. Utilizing the FACS can help students identify major muscles and their functions by using different emotional expressions. Since emotion is scientifically proven to be evoked by emotional expression as mentioned in paragraph 9, the results of which emotions are present can be more accurate. Having the ability to identify and associate muscles on a personal level with the aid of machinery allows for the knowledge to be kept with personal association, making FACS very important in this field of education. FACS can help memorize those muscles and retain knowledge about their function from a simple facial analysis.

An application of FACS can prove useful in a school enviroment, as it can provide tailored learning, aid in school counseling, and aid in learning Anatomy. As explored in the paragraphs above, FACS provides a wide range of oppurtunities for schools to engage in different forms of learning and measuring progress with its aid. With a universal impact in many different aspects of school life, FACS can revolutionize what teachers and counselors think is best for students. The software provides a scope of use not limited to just science, but to schools and companies who can utilize FACS for learning and for projects in the future.",5,7,0.8300995826721191

The facial expression technology can be used to help teachers help the students know what there doing.

New face reading technology can give a voice to the quiet ones in class and help the teachers know what they are feeling.

Now this is helpful in classrooms to know what students are really feeling and can even prevent

suicides if the teachers can use this information to help the student get the help they need.

The face reading technology can use the data to process sadness and boredom and can help the students more than the teachers. This technlogy is being created by some people that have studied these facial expressions and emotions. In paragraph 5 the author explains how the doctors that created this tecnology know their data is correct.""yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinchi studied human anato my to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. The artist of the painting where also students of there craft so they would have pin point accuacy.This helps people now that they can lay back on this idea of face reading tecnnology.

Knowing that the technology is very accurate this can be used in the classrooms to help more that just the teachers, students but even the principles know if there staff might be off. This can help principles and advisors know how there teachers are doing.

Have you ever considered what it would be like if you could tell what other people were feeling exactly? A new technology called Facial Action Coding System has been tested to find the exact emotions of other people. For example, in the first sentence of the first paragraph it describes Mona Lisa's exact emotions in percentages. Many people wonder if this new technology could be useful in a classroom to detect whether children reallly understand a concept or if they just say they understand.

Children in school are often confused with a certain subject and are too embarrassed to speak up. Some people sugjest that the new technology Facial Action Coding can change that. In paragraph 6 of "" Making Mona Lisa Smile""

it states "" ' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. ' Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor'""(Nick D'Alto, Mona Lisa Smile). Dr. Huang suggests that if we brought this technology into the schools then some children may be able to succeed. Teachers with this technology could use it to improve their lesson to captivate the students or help them individually.

The children could benefit from the teachers improved lesson by getting more involed in the classroom. Overall if children were introduced to this technology, They would succeed not only in shcool, but in life too.

The author of this passage has pointed out some very interesting facts. The author has pointed out the fact that children may not have the best attention span and may not understand what is going on. The author suggests that people should bring technology into schools to improve the likelyhood of the child succeeding. many studies have shown that this technology works, so the author wants the children to have a shot at becoming the best they can be.

Facial Action Coding System allows us to weigh different units to identify mixed emotions. Its a simple process that allows us to classify six basic emotions; happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness. Those emotions are associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. The text states ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face ; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""This is called an ""action unit"". Individuals often show varying degrees of expression, using FACS the new emotion recognition tracks these facial movements .

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is esential because it can detect how other people are feeling, even when hiding their emotions. The system can recognize the subtle facial movements and mixed emotions. With this system we can get a better understanding of students and more. ",2,7,0.84757000207901
910482c,"Is there such thing that a computer can define our emotions? How can a computer software define our emotions? Now in days, the technology is getting bigger as the years pass by people start to know even how to make a car drive by themselves that is one of the things we do not hear everyday. The computer sowftware that can define our emotionsis now that people use in work or even at school use.

Imagine the world with the computer software that can read our emotions that will be very amazing. For instance, you can probably not tell the emotions on somebody face when you see them they may be smiling right at you, but what if they are feeling another way you may never know what they are actually feeling that is why i think the computer software is a good idea to read people emotions. As the time goes by people are getting tired of showing the same feeling they might already started to think that they are not getting no where with what they are feeling. Of course, that everybody know how to describe what happy and sad looks like, but what if they are not feeling none of does emotions what if they are actually nervous or scared and there is no way that you can help them. The computer software stores alots of energy different kind of specific emotions that people can use to tell other people's emotions.

The calculation in the computer software in human perform is the same why that might be because, not everybody used it why we need to use it they may ask themselves and yes that is a good question well that is because that way you can even hlep yourself if you are smiling, but the results say a different thing for example, that you are sad in reality you can push your self to not be sad anymore that is one good way to see if you need to change your emotions.

Describing the computer software is not really hard to do it you can just say it shows us how you are really feeling even doe if you are smiling. They might get scared for the momnet but, that is one way also to help other people. ",2,7,0.7500255107879639
9128156,"Why Facial Action Coding System is a valuable resource for students?

Scientists now have new advanced technology that can identify the emotions of paintings that date back to hundreds of years ago. Scientists can create 3D models of the facial construction of the paintings features using computer models that scan the facial features of the person in the painting.

Scientists state that there are six basic emotions that are associated with the paiting person. For example Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Surprise, Anger and Disgust. The new technology software of the 3D models of the person are loaded into a computer and emotion-recognition starts its role as taking the expressions of the paitings and putting them into movements that will show what and how the person is feeling in that era of time.

Scientists now are trying to put facial recognition computers into classrooms so that the teachers can get a better understanding about how their students are understanding information and how they are feeling.

Human behavior analysists have been studying the emotional behavior of humans for generations now and have come to a conclusion. This conclusion is that you can sometimes understand how your friend is feeling but is that their true emotion showing or is that a facade that is disguised. This conclusion is to show how valuable a facial recognition computer is and how it can be useful to a classroom enviroment.

By studing the facial features of humans scientists have been able to create steps that show the exact emotion of a painting of a person. This is also valuable information because we can have a theory about what times were like in paintings that date back to thousands of years ago.

Think about this if we took the acient egyptian hieroglyphs and took their paitings about what it was like to live in that era and translated it using the facial technology we have today we can figure out how the egyptians felt back in their time and possibly how the acted and reacted to the situations around them. This information plays a key role in history today that can help us conclude the situations of the past lifes of famous paintings. This is also a new step in history that can reveal so much about eras that we know nothing about and this can lead us to discovery of so much more.

Emotions are what make us human. Without emotions what would we be? Think of this if we lived in a society where emotions or feeling anything was banned and that we couldnt feel anything. That honestly would be the downfall in society because there wouldnt be anything to do and we would be bland. It also would mark the end of history because nothing would happen.

I believe it is a cool study to figure out the emotions of paintings and the people in them. I personally am a complete fanatic about egyptian time and the greek gods and godesses time and being bale to figure out the facial features and the emotions and feelings of the paitings of those people is completely awaesome. Its like time travel to me. Being able to study the history of those paintings of people and figuring out what they felt during that time period is like being there with the person and going through the same feelings with them.

I believe it is a great idea to put these types of facial recognition computers into classrooms because it will benefit for the teachers. The benefits of these computers is that teachers can have a better understanding of how they are teaching and how that information is being comprehended by the students. This is also a valuable source for teachers too because they can figure out how their students are feeling and if something is wrong with the students by understanding their facial recognitions.

In conclusion it would be a benefitial source for classrooms to have facial recognition computers for teachers and students. ",4,7,0.8991181254386902
9129562,"Yes, I do think that we should use the Facial Action Coding in classroom. The reason why I say yes is because students do get bored and frustrated when doing notes or homework and even inclass work. The Facial Action Coding would allow the teachers to really see how or what there students emotions when it comes to doing there work, the teacher can change things up to making the class fun when they are doing note or work. Also the teacher can understand what's going on with his or her students in the classroom to see if they are struggling or if they get on how to do the work. I think math teachers would really would like to have this because, they would be able to tell if the students are lying to them on if they get it or if they don't get it. So the teacher would be able to help the students more that are struggling with the work. Also other classes than just math the teachers would be able to use it for helping there students in class that are actually not getting on how to do the work or if they do or don't understand the note. Like in a history class alot of time it can be very confusing and the students don't understand on how to do the teacher would be able to know if they really get it or they are just lying straight to there faces. The teachers would also know if they are having a good or a bad day, if they student is having a bad day they could some how cheer them up to make them happier in there class or the rest of the day.",2,7,0.7005908489227295
9145057,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes the new technology facial Action Coding System or FACS which allows a computer to pick up on what you feel like and how you are feeling. I claim that the use of FACS in a class room enviroment could have used but mostly believe it is not a valuable resource in class.

One reason why It is not a vaulable resource is it only programed to read six basic human emotions which are Happieness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.

Another reason why it is invaulable is that a human is already prepared to read another persons emotions because it is a task that is already done each and everyday. Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states ""using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face."" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.

Another person could say it is vaulable to help students and keep them entertained in a lesson and switch it up a bit. Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states ""For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work but the problem being is that a program so complex like that requires so much code and algorithms that it requires a beffy computer to run so you would need to make multiple servers capable of holding that much information not only that but the school would have to divert much more of their budget toward stronger computers because Dr. Huang states Your home Pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode smiles"" This saying from Dr. Huang proves that a PC for home use is not strong enough for this program so what makes you average home pc different from a school one other than filters put on the pc which reduces preformance but the worse thing that could happen is what if the power happens to shut down or go out do to a surge that program requires power to run so that is also a big problem.

In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit. The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power.",6,7,0.7979832291603088

It helps us learn more about our facial features, like how all 44 major muscles help the model knows what expressions to detect. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

The brillent Facial Action Coding System will be able to change a veriety of industries.

How angry would people be if students would be sitting in school taking a test or doing an assignment and they were getting upset because they do not understand the assignment?

Now we dont need to get upset anymore because the Facial Action Coding Software can detect these kind of emotions. "" A classsroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" predicts Dr. Huang.

"" Then the software could alter the question if need be so the student can understand the computerized assignment.

This would be extremly useful for people who find it a challenge to understand tough questions.

"" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Haung, "" So computers need to understand that to.""

This is very impotant because people can not always tell if a person is smiling becuase they are happy, or they are tring to cover up what they are truly feeling.

In a classroom, students are not likly to talk about their feeling in fear of getting bullied and made fun of.

The Facial Action Coding Software can calculate the emotions held by a kid and help to releave the stress of a diffacult test of assignment.

With this being said, kids can also minipulate the software by acting sad or angry to try to weaken the strangth of the computer based assignment.

This could lead to helping develop a deceptive attitude in young students that could continue to worsen as time goes on.

Would we rather choose to help the students who really need additional guidence in a classroom get the help that they need or not introduce this brillent program to countless students because of the fear of kids putting their own furture at steak because they want to take the easy road in life?

The Facial Action Coding Software is a mind-blowing program that will help kids and students of all ages acheive what they did not think would be possible.

With being able to detect a sad or confused face on a student will help the FACS program to understand the emotions of that kid.

Aslo, being able to change for any kids need is not something that a teacher can do very easily.

this would help the teacher be able to give support to the kids with out being their next to them all the time.

The Facial Action Coding System will help many kids as well as teacher all across the world.

928fff7,"The Facial Action Coding System is a type of technology that can help alot of things that go wrong and it can also be bad.

This kind of technology can be and cannot be as valuable to read he students emotions because the students will have different emotions each time you read their emotions. So this technology can be valuaable because when you can read the students emotions like if there is something that is bothering them and they dont say anything, this technology can help the staff and teachers know what is going on. and it could be bad because the student who's emotions you are reading is maybe not comfortable with you reading their emotions, so you can get in trouble. So in conclusion this i am nuteral to this type of technology because i believe that it can be good or bad. No t just one or the other. ",2,7,0.855972945690155
9290b8a,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is an amazing tool but using it in a classroom is both helpful and pointless. Being able to find out a persons emotions is a good thing to do but everyone isnt the same and emotions are the same way. people's emotions work in different ways and sometimes people can assume that your either angry.happy or sad just by your facial expression but in all honesty your just cool and thats the problem with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) because first of all technology isn't always right second of all technology can't reveal or say how a human or person feels because its not that person and the FACS was programed to study facial movements and mucles like it says in paragraph 3 "" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer modelof the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" but what if the expression on the person's face that the FACS is programed to think that is the expression for sadness isnt that at all? What if its just that person's regular face and acutally could be happy but because the computer is programed to take the expression of sadness because of his or her facial muscles in conclusion the technology from the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is impressive but it wouldnt really help much for students in a classroom.

92a2621,"Computers, we all like using computers it's one of the things more used around the world. Computers are use at work, school, home, hospitals and ect. Since computers are use so much around the world it's only right that people keep making new advance computers that can change the future. How advance can computers get.? Well by reding this article it shows the new level of computer that people have made.

New software from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Ilinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam that can reed how you feel even do if you fake it. According with the article it says this new 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscle in the model most move like a human muscle, so it can detect the feeling. They classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. This it's crazy it says if you not smiling right, like happy there a video imagery that recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. Some times we have trouble describing the look in our friend face if they happy sad or ect., but Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions.

I personal think this is a bad ideal, becuase people feeling its very personal. Example

if someone in your family die and you feel so sad put you don't want people to know about it and here comes a computer and detects your feeling and people going to start asking, ""oh hey, why are you so sad"" and that will make people more mad. I mean i could work sometimes like if you see a girl and the computer detects that she sad and need someone, you could go and try to make her happy and see if that changes something. I think a lot of people won't like it either because they think it's violationg their feelings. I think this computer will work if only used the right way, i mean for something good or to help people be happy.",4,7,0.8213213682174683

I think it would be most useful in a classroom because if a teacher is busy with another student. The computer could notice that your confused and try to show you a different lesson or even just try to show it a different way. This would help the teachers because they would have more help if everyone is stuck on the same lesson and needed help.

Most people would like it because you can use it in video games and movies. They could use it to make the characteristics look more real and it would be easier to make them show their emotions by using the FACS. Because it can read all the muscles in the face so they could use it to make the facial expresions look more real.     ",2,7,0.7937967777252197

The Facial Action Coding System is also very helpful to everyone and lets us, in a way, ""dig deeper"" to people's thoughts and emotions. The use for the Facial Action Coding System can be very useful when reading student's emotional expressions and can very easily help the student learn.

This technology can be very useful to not only the students, but also to the teacher in the classroom. She/He would not have to beg or keep asking the students if they understand the lesson or not, but rather have the robot read their expressions to see if they understand the information that is being brought to them. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". Students would not have to reliey on teachers to make the lesson exciting and fun. The program would make the lesson fun and exciting for the student, which translates to better grades and better oppurtunites for the future of the student.

Classroom computers that read emotions could very easily become the next big thing because of their smartness and ability to adapt to students needs when learning. Many people, whether they are students or not, will benefit from these computers that read emotions.",3,7,0.8785983920097351
92bb58b,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) program can be used to detect human emotion through complex algorithms on a advanced computer. Since this program cant work on the average PC, Dr. Huang wrote down some simple instructions that encode different emotions. These instrutions are not as advanced as the FACS program but they are simple enough for the average PC. This can dectect your muscular action units to detect all your current emotions. It can also detect fake emotions as if you were trying to fake a smile or frown just by looking at the major mucles on your face.

Dr. huang would like to use this program for kids in schools. He says the program would help detect when a student is becoming confused or bored of a lesson. When this happens the FACS program will modify the lesson such as an effective human instructor would. This in my opinion could change the learning process for many people and create a new learning system across the world. But this could also take many jobs away ruining the carrer of a teacher. This whole program could end horribly making teachers go on a strike. But no special computer is needed as in the article states that this program could run on a school computer.

All together this program could change schools for the students, and effect the jobs of teachers/professor. This program was made to detect human emotions but can be used as an advanced learning process. The things that this program can do are impressive but Dr. Huang aslo says that humans can also detect emotions. But a teacher can't teach every student in their ways needed, teachers teach the whole class using the technique. Overall this program should be tested in a few schools before going active to each school.   ",3,7,0.8284734487533569

Another example that the author used that was included that was good was in paragrah one when it states that ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This shows that the author included logos in his paragrah another way of having a valuable short.

935e748,"Facial Action Coding System can be valuable, and is more valuable then not. It allows computers to read emotions based off of muscles. the text says in the third paragraph, "" The process begins when the computer construcks a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human musceks."" It goes more in detail when what we can do, and can even tell a fake smile. The system will help out in many ways then anything else could help out. Facial Action Coding System is valuable for school because it can read the emotisons to tell if someone is understanding it, to show if the people who are learning on that topic enjoy it, and will make people more willing to do something.

First thing that it can do is read the emotsions of the person learn on the topic, then tell if they are getting it or not. If they don't get it, then it can signal the teacher that they need help or to go over it more in detail. This is very good since it will allow the teacher to better understand how his/her teaching methons work as well as if they can move on. The text even says that it can, for example it says, ""'A class room cimputer could recignize when a studen is beciming confused or bored,'"" showing that its not wrong. Being able to know that everyone gets it, and understands what the teacher is getting helps out big time. It could even require no test since everyone would get it, or even let them move on quicker.

The second thing that will be valuable to classrooms that the Facial Action Coding System can do is see if the people learning it is enjoying it. While it might be stupid to think about it, if the people learning as well as the person teaching it enjoys what they are going over they are more likely to want to do it. The text says in paragraph eight, ""But in a false smile, the mouth stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a differnet muscle, the risorius."" This shows that they cant fake a smile to make it look more enjoyable just because it's easy to them. Since it will read, and tell if people are enjoying what is being taught they can do things that everyone will be more willing to do. This will allow the class to move more quickly as well as more effectively.

The last as well as the most important thing the Facial Action Coding System can do is read the emotsions of someone to make them more willing to do something. While it can't do it directly it can however make them more happy, this will make them more willing to. Them being more happy makes them pay more attinsion due to them enjoying it. The text says ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles ot only expresses emotsions, but also may even help produce them."" If it can help produce a smile then it will change emotsions. The changing of emotsions can allow teachers to do some subject that is boring. The subject will become tired then the Facial Action Coding System will know then change the emotsion. Changing this emotsion in a good way will make them more happy, and possibly enjoy it more.

While this system will have many down sides such as cost, people messing with it, and a lot of complants. These are things that come with everything no matter what it is. This Facial Actsion Coding System has so much potintsion that can be used to help the class rooms. Making the students happy with it makes them like school more even.

There are so many more examples just like that. The robot cant predict what you are actually feeling cause there is alot more emotion behind a smile.

There are things they can do to make the system plossible such as making a part that scans your brain. If they made a brain scan with this technology it would be way more accurate and be able to see inside your head and see how you actually feel.

93b2441,"Schools Should use Facial Action Coding Systems

Try to imagine a world where people might be able to hide their feelings from others but not the computer. There has been a new software developed that has the ability to determine people's emotions called Facial Action Coding System. The software has even been able to determine exactly how much percent of each emotion is present in the Mona Lisa. As this software arises, there has been questions as to how schools could use this software to their advantage. With this system, schools could help students stay in tune in class, place students with teachers they learn well from, and force students to tell the truth.

The Facial Action Coding Sytem should be used in schools because teachers would have the opportunity to change the way they are teaching when their students start to get bored. In so many cases students do not do well in school simply because their teacher might be too boring or confusing. If teachers had the abilty to know when students are getting bored through this system, then there is a good chance the students would get better grades as a result. With this software ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" There would be no excuses for teachers boring or confusing students because they would have a tool to become aware of it.

Another key part of students being successful in school is having a teacher that they truly connect with, therefore; the software system could play a large part in helping schools place students with teachers that they have a connection with. With the software system, ""a genuine smile and a forced one"" could be detected. Using the data found students could be placed with the teachers that they have genuine smiles with. There is a good chance that if students were with a teacher they truly like, then they would learn more from the lessons and get better grades.

In schools, there are constantly so many lies and rumors going around, but with the software system, lying could be detected. Considering the system can ""spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,"" it could be able to determine when students are lying. If lying in schools could be detected, there could be a decrease in bullying and possibly shootings. It could even teach students that honesty is the best policy, and it could hold students accounable for their actions. The system could uncover the truth in so many situations for the better.

In the end, the new software system has many positive aspects that could benefit schools in many ways, including helping students learn more effeciently and forcing students to tell the truth. Not using this tool that has come available would be foolish knowing the many benefits that could come from it. Something that could help students learn their school work in a more efficient way and hold students responsible for their actions would be a good thing for schools in this day and age. It could have the capabiliy to teach students integrity at a young age putting them ahead of many young adults in the world today.",4,7,0.8607431650161743

If you confused, your computer can read your emotions and try to break down the problem. It would be able to explain step by step on how to do it. This would be of great help for the students.

Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Amsterdam, was able to create a new computer software that can recognize emotions. This process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "" action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding System), has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He was able to associated each characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Since facial expression for each emotion are universal, by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. This would help a lot students in their classes because if you have a computer that can read emotions and is able to identify if you are confused it would be able to break the problem down step by step like that you would not have to wait on the teacher who is helping two other students. The classes would be able to go faster because the teacher would not have to stop every 10 minutes to re-explained the same the problem like 20 times. A computer would be able to recognized if you getting bored and be able to modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Or maybe you just browsing on the web and an ad appears on your screen and you smile at it , a similir ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

Prof. Thomas Huang lastest innovation could be of alot of help for student and teachers. Teachers would not have to stress about re-explaining the same chapter like 20 times. Student would not get behind during class because the computer would be able to identify their emotion. Be able to break it down step by step if they get confused.

940251b,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" in the story the author descrbes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Is this technology to read emotinal expressions of humans wrong? How do they make this technology to read people's emotions? Who's idea was this?

First, I think reading people's mind's by this technology is wrong. First reason is it's none of our bussines. Also reading people's minds is something that is totally creepy. This technology can detect anyone who's happy, sad, angry, and disgusted. Everyone has their own personal secrets that he or she doesn't want to reveal their feelings. They need to invent something to help people around the world.

Second, this idea came from Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Instatute for Advanced Science at the University of Illionois, working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are exports at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Both of these professors want's to know of their invention to the world to earn credit. Do they even know what their doing? Both professors test's the painting of Mona Lisa of her emotions. Mona Lisa results is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Then, this software technology has a constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 majors muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". Then Dr. Hunag relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding System. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions ( as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). The new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code. This technology can read people's emotions by raising your lips at the corners of your mouth. Then squirt your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkiling. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes.

Finally, in conclusion it's bad to read other personal thought's. Both professors makes a computer to see emotions in people's mind's. Finding the new technology is rare in the United States. The new computer is not an ordinary science teacher grading your work this is a professional professors inventions. In my opinion these professors should make a new invention to change the world and by not reading people's minds.",2,7,0.7788704633712769
946f2b5,"I dont think the a computer reading emotins would be valuable in a classroom because technology is not always acurrate. We use a lot of different facial muscles when just making one facial expression. Student dont really show emotion when the class their in is boring.

One reason i dont think its valuable because emotions can change at any moment .Saying someone is 80% happy in a pictuer wouldnt always be ture becuase they could be smiling but also could be more sad than they are happy. Some people have a bipolar disoder which makes their eomtion change very fast , and some people are just very temperamental. Some students show emotions differnt than others . For example one student that is very upset could be yelling and shouting about it and another student that as angery as the other student could be very calm about it and not showing that they are angery.

Another reason i dont think its acurrate is because sometimes we dont just use one muscle to make a facial expresion. The computer only test one facial muscle to an emotion. Paragraph three states"" For example , your frontails pars laterlis muscle raises your eyebrows when your surprised ..."" but also when someone is surprised they sometimes move their mouth muscles. We move our mouth muscles for almost every emotion.

I dont think it would be a good idea to put one of these computers in a classroom becuase each student shows emotion different and some students might not shoe emotion at all , therefore the computer would be getting emotion from about half the claaroom which wouldnt be acurrate .",3,7,0.8170813322067261
9476b21,"The Facial Action Coding System is one of the new technologies of this century that is very complex and futuristic. It uses algorithims and muscle knowledge to discern the emotion of people in reality, photos, and other facial sources as well. The system can calculate how much you're happy, sad, suprised, and angry. Knowing other people's emotions is a great tool and can be used in many different situations. This new technology is good for a lot of things, and being used in a classroom is one of them.

Students need to be focused and engaged at all times in the classroom because if they are neither engaged, nor focused then they will struggle with learning new things and excelling in and out of the classroom. A computer in a class constantly scanning students' faces could become a distraction, but it would solve more problems than it could create. These days students are more vulnerable to distractions, and there are a lot of uncontrollable factors they are standing against. Some do not get enough sleep, some do not get enough to eat, and some do not have good health, whether that be mentally, socially, emotionally, or physically. These factors can take a toll on their ability to focus and be receptive to new information being taught in the classroom. They easily can become ""confused or bored""(D'alto 6) or even distracted in a class, but if there was a way to track the behaviors that coincide with those emotions then it would be easier to assist the students. With the computer scanning their faces students emotions would be much more clear, and, as D'alto said in paragraph 6, the needed adjustments could be made to help students pay attention so they can learn.

Many teachers find it hard to keep their lesson plans exciting and engaging because of their lack of resources, but with this computer it would be easy to recieve real feedback from students emotions on what they like and dislike. Moreover, even though the computer might present itself as a distraction in the beginning over time it would become a useful tool for the classroom, and be a huge asset for both students and teachers.

Now in this new day and age a man named Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman institute has created a machine that can tell what you are feeling even if you are hidding it.

I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. The reason i am for and not against is because this machine can actually save lives. For those who pretend to be happy and are actually depressed they the machine can pick that up and that person/student can get the help and teatment they need. This can help because this machine can detect ""happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear and sadness.""

They had did this a few times to test it.

In conclusion, they should use this to read studnets emotions because they maybe depressed and it could save lives.

949e0f0,"Why do we have emotions? Why were we given thought of feeling and expressing them with our face? Our ability to do that is amazing and has helped us understand each other better through the years. As technology is always advantcing so has our understanding of other humans, but now scientists are creating machines to do that for us. To become our eyes and calulate the exact percentage of the basic emotions we feel, is this really needed, and if anything, might hurt us as a whole? I believe that this Facial Action Coding System is a waste of time and could harm the future of humanities ability to understand emotions.

First, is how at the bare minium the Facial Action Coding System is worthless. From the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article by Nick D'Alto, some perks it is able to include from this is only the idea of face reconition allowing ads to know whether you are smiling or frowning at the ad to know whether to keep ads like that or move on with new ones. This is a huge flaw because people can already log into a computer happy or upset but the FACS isn't going to know that so the system is basically ruined. Another thing is it being able to change a lesson to suit a students emotions if they are feeling confused or bored. This could be a good thing but how is it going to change the lesson to make it better? Even if it does it still wouldn't mean it would make it better for the student they could still be bored with the lesson making the FACS useless again.

Second, if this thing becomes more widespread and popular to the extent of everyone can use it anytime, then that's taking able for humans to naturally understand one another's feelings without FACS. I already explained any ideas given in the article are useless but if one day everyone is using it in forms of video chatting or smart-glasses, this is taking away from the natural experience of human commuication. Take for example texting, texting is dimminishing the vaule of talking to one another face-to-face, if future generations this could lead everyone to be more un-social and that creates problems on their own, this could be the same with advancements we put into FACS, more people becoming reliant on FACS to the extent where when we don't have it we will become naive to socailizing.

Third, is the invasion of privacy this can create. To look into a persons facial muscles to calulate the exact percentage of what they are feeling can be consider creepy and inhumane. Personally, to know that a computer knows exactly how I am feeling makes me feel uneasy. I know I am not the only one and others probably feel worst able this then I do. This was in the same vein as when the lie detector first was made, everyone was fancinated by a computer being able to tell if you are lying. However the person who made it regets ever making for its inconsistancy on being accurate. Who should say that FACS will always be accurate and falsely accuse other's emotions into a legal bind or hasty agument?

In conclusion, this essay is to prove my claim that this Facial Action Coding System is not worth anyones time, money, or thought. From it being basically useless without any sort of advancement including the loophole around ads to it really not helping students with lesson plans. Then the idea of us becoming more naive people and another reliant on technology to understand others. Finally, the inhumane way of distrubing our privacy with and it could also falsely calulate our emotions and cause more harm then good. WIth everything said this should give a clear view of that terrible invention we call FACS should be put away and never opened again and to take this as a learning experience.

94e7de9,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smiles,"" the author tells us how this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to recognize human emotions. For many that would be shocking and interesting. This news has certainly peaked my interest. This new technology could be a major breakthough in many cases. The author gave us many examples to go off of but their are so many more. I believe that this Facial Action Coding System can be used for good when it comes to internal or personal problems, helping to improve students learning process', and to improve the overall way we communicate with our computer.

This new technology as I hope, can be used to solve many issues. When it comes to internal or personal issues or problems that occur, it can be quite stressful or upsetting some times. We could use this technology to read the emotions of a student and identify the changes in there mood. This technology, as Dr. Eckman said in the passage, can detect happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Suppose a student's family member was in a car accident. This technology could identify that something wrong has happened by the sadness on the student's face. Suppose a student suffers from depression. We could code these computers to not only identy emotions but again, alert to us that something is wrong. This, in turn, allows the student to get proper treatment and help.

Another way that this new technology could help, as Dr. Huang stated, is if it could recognize when a student becomes bored or confused. This is a sure fire way to help thousands, if not millions of students stay focused in school and learn. When the program recognizes the students boredom or agitation or confusion, it could make things simpler or change the way they are learning to best keep them entertained and on board. A lot of students in my very own school are hit with such boredom that they doze off in class. With this new technology that can change.

Have you ever had times where you got frustrated because your computer wouldn't cooperate or do the right thing you requested? I sure have and it is quite often. This Facial Action Coding System could help in those situations as well. If more emotions are put into this system it could detect and find a way to change those emotions if negative. They have technology where you can command your computer or device with your voice, but sometimes that does not work either. This new technology combined with the voice commands could help us communicate or requests and objectives clearly so the computer can understand. Although our devices may not be flesh and blood, they do indeed have brains. Uncapable of many things, but never the less it has a control center. We could better communicate with our devices through this new technology.

This technology, like I have described, can have many good and positive uses. I'm sure you could come up with many just as well as the rest of us. As technology advances we learn to accept it and adapt to it. We use it in everyday life. As you can see, I believe this technology could improve humanity and student's lives by identifying problems and finding ways to fix them, improve learning process', and better our communication with computers and such devices.",5,7,0.8925066590309143

But when you are not really smiling in a fake smile,the mouth is strecthed sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. These muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is fake smiling.

It is also proved that moving your facial muscled not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them Leonardo Da vinci's new software stores similar anatomical information as electronic codes.

This sieastem can recognize emotions whether you're angry, happy, surprise, disgust, fearles and ect. This process begins when the computer constrac a 3-D computer model of the face. all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Action unit are movement of one ore more muscle. Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman wich are the creators of FACS.

Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle, above your eyes, reased your eyebrows whe you surprise also your orbicularis around your mouth, and tightens your lips to sho anger. This example we can se it in the firts pharaghaph when it talks when shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and r percent angry.

In the other hand by reading other people emotions would help you figure out on how to help them focus more , because every human bein are neurobologically wired, and to learn anything , our minds most be focus and our emotions need to feel balance.

To begin with the technology itself can tell how a person is feeling. It recognizes the human muscles in the face and can tell when a person using it, is fake smiling or smiling because they're happy. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions ,happiness,surprise ,anger ,disgust, fear , and sadness and then associates each with characteristic movements of the facial struture.""

To sum it all up , this new technology would be a great impact for generations to come. It would help out emotionally, scientifically and personally. It would help students realize what they are and aren't intrested in , and it would help the teachers understand where the students are struggling in as well and how they can help them in subjects they dont quite well understand.

95a9091,"Humans have feelings. Everyone knows that. We can be happy, sad, angry, grossed out. No one can tell us how we feel. If you look at someone and that person is smiling, we will probably assume that he or she is happy. What we don't know is that she is probably hurting on the inside. Having a software that assumes feelings won't help in a way.

Scientist Dr. Paul Eckman created

a system called FACS. It stands for Facial Action Coding System. By looking at your face it can tell how you're feeling. The system can read "" six basic emotions - happiness, surprise,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-"". You're probably wondering how. Your facial muscles show how you're

feeling. You can feel more than one feeling. What if

you feel happy but surpried. Your face wont split in half. One half is smiling while the other half has an eyebrow arched. No that cannot happen. Like people, systems can't tell how someone is feeling.

The FACS system in a classroom will depend on the age group. Why would you need it?

There are countless people who will listen to you express your feelings. Especially in a school. I do not see a pont in computers and humans to communicate. Again, there are so many people in this world you can speak

to why make a system for you to talk to a computer. What is the computer going to do if it see's your faceand

you look sad. It wont do anything buy register that you're not having a good day. Students should be having conversations with a classmate not having their head in their phones, computers, or tablets.

"" Most human communication is noonverbal, including emotional communication,"" states Dr. Huang. I believe that's wrong. People want to talk about how they feel. There are jobs specificaly for talking about feelings. Teenagers are difficult and want to keep most things bottled in so no one can judge or give sympathy. Once they find the right person, they'll talk their heads' off about how they're feeling.

Having this program won't help

humans express how they feel. They will just want to conceal it even more. We don't want to appear weak. If we appear weak then other people will take advantage. I can sleep for 9 hours but sometimes I'll still be tired. The bags under my eyes will tell you that I am tired. You will assume that I did not sleep at all but in reality I slept for nine hours. The system will not give you

an

accurate response to how someone is feeling, it will just assume.  ",4,7,0.7898272275924683

A clam for or against the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions, I think it's a good idea to know the mood or emotions of people.

The first reason why it's a good idea to know the mood or emotions of a person because imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. Knowing their emotion you can do something to help them with their day. For example, if someone is sad in the picture or something you can help them by cheering up their day.

The second reason why it's good idea to know the mood or emotion of a person because theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. For example, Putting on happy or sad face can actually get you sad or happy. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial experssions.

The last piece of evidence is we as people usually have trouble describing a person's emotion. For example, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. With the new computer software, Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotion.

95cfb46,"Every day the evolution of technology further changes the way mankind operates. From the wheel to the automobile, and from the automobile to the airplane, and needless to say it will not be stopping there. ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto is an article about a groundbreaking new innovation which could vastly impact civilization in ways that have yet to be thought of. This new technology -- the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) -- will allow both mankind and computers to identify human emotions, which will be beneficial in many areas, but most of all in the classroom. Sometimes it can be difficult for teachers to be aware of when students are unable to focus on the task at hand. Something like the FAC System will enable teachers or computers to be aware of when students are losing focus, and to either change focus or to get the student back on task. Using this technology to read student's emtional expressions would be extremely valuable for the student's ability to learn.

D'Alto talks about how the FAC System is capable of detecting emotions based on the positioning of muscles. This makes it possible for teachers, computer, and honestly anyone to know what someone could be thinking. ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" (Paragraph 6). This ability to modify the lesson to keep the student learning throughout the full period of classtime would dramatically increase the amount of knowledge the student took in over the course of the class. Instead of losing focus after an hour -- or even just 15 minutes -- this technology could scan the faces of students to detect whether they have lost focus and become bored, are feeling frustrated and unable to understand, or even hopelessly lost. The Facial Action Coding System would turn this boredom into concentration, this frustration into comprehension, and this confusion into clarity. Instead of losing class time or missing the lessons because of a lack of comprehension or focus then the lesson can be adapted or the student can be brought back on task, greatly expanding the capacity in which they can further their knowledge.

The ability to read emotions would be undeniably beneficial for the knowledge students gain. Instead of wasting time unfocused or lost they can be put back on task or have the lesson changed up to make it more engaging or just easier to follow. Students will spend more time learning and less time trying to understand what they missed while the lesson moves on. This technology -- the Facial Action Coding System -- will no doubt be extremely beneficial in the learning environment.",4,7,0.8903045654296875

The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System in other words FACS that identifies human emotions should be using it classrooms. For reasons such as that it can help a teacher identity how one feeling are towards their lesson as well as telling someone their emotions.

Having this new technology can improve a student way of learning a certian lesson. In the sixth paragraph is says "" ""A classroon computer could recognize when a student us becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" "" By having a computer recognize human emotions is can help pick out a different way the students learns or a more helpful way to explain a topic. Some student often may not understand a topic may may be affraid to speck up because they may feel jugded by others that do understand.

Reading ones expressions can be hard, other people may not know how to express what they are feeling, but by having these computers that do it can help people know what others are feeling. The author says ""For intsance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" With this it gives humans a new way of looking at stuff and seeing whats behind everything. This technology is a just one more step of what else is out there.

Computers that can now identify human emotions what is it for? It can allow students see and understand a topic they may be confused by simpling just looking at there computer screens. It also helps tells people what others may be feeling when they can""t explain, helps us see in a differnt way.

With the new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"", it can recognize your facial expressions and tell your emotions. This technology can be very useful in the classroom because It can tell if you are interested in the topic that you are talking about, Also it can tell if you are disinterested in the topic and need a little spark of interest, and lastly it can maybe even tone the learning down if you are too confused or getting angry to understand what is going on.

With all of this abundance of new technology coming in the future some of them can be used for our academics. With this new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"" we can use it to improve our test scores, and starting to put interest into kids in school. Within the text it says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-hapiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". This shows us that Dr. Paul Eckman has made technology that has the potential to recognize if people are interested in school. Also, with this technology it could provide feedback to the teachers to see how they are doing with their students in class.

This technology could also be able to tell if someone is doing poorly in the class because of disinterest. Dr. Huang says in the article, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" What Dr. Huang says can alter the way that kids learn very dramatically. If you have a bored or uninteredted kid in your class the computer can recognize it immediately and change his/her lesson so that they are able to learn better without being bored.

Confusion, anger, and depression can also all be a factor on a child's learning, but with this new technology maybe it will be able to understand when they need to see a guidance councellor for help. Dr. Huang continues to say, ""Most Human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" ,and he also says, ""so computers need to understand that, too."" What Dr. Huang is trying to say is that this technology can also help us with things that we don't want to talk about to other people. For example, if somone was having family problems at home and it was effecting their school work the computer would be able to recognize that this person was very depressed and can get them the help they need within the school.

Technology is evolving and we should be using it to its full potential of helping our future look brighter by increasing our academics with this ""Facial Action Coding System"". This new system could help out many students when they are in bored, confused, angry, depressed, or even interested in what they are learing.

Some people might even say that in the future, everything will be run by computers. Though, some of this amazing new programming, such as the Facial Action Coding System, is unnecessary.

Even though this programming is very cool and sounds like a revolutionary new thing, there are still a few problems with the idea. One problem being that a bunch of people probably won't agree to use it because of facial recognition databases and government conspiracy theories. Another problem is that computers are just computers and human emotions are much more diverse and complex than six basic emotions which happen to be portrayed differently by every human being. For example, in paragraph 6 it is stated that, ' ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson..."" '. This, in itself, sounds like it could be super helpful to alot of students. However, computers do not have brains and can not think for themselves, and even though there is some super advanced software involved, modifying the lesson based on a student's face has alot of loop holes. Faking a convincing facial expression really isn't hard to do, so students could manipulate their lesson quite easily, keeping them from learning necessary things. Also, not a lot of students constantly enjoy their lessons so modifying the knowledge based on if a student looks bored isn't very smart. On the other hand, the article does say that, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive - for video games or video surgery."" This shows that this type of software really isn't useless, it's just that using it to read students' emotional expressions isn't really a necessary thing.

To conclude, this type of programming could be useful if used in the proper way, but it most likely won't do too much for students. If students have found ways to get out of or cheat on homework before, then there's nothing stopping them from breaking the rules of this facial recognition software either.",4,7,0.8323969841003418

It all starts with a 3-D modle of a face. It then goes on to calculate the placement of the muscles in the face. It takes into consideration the six basic emotions. Each emotion is paired with the musces. An example would be raised eyebrows which are associted with shock,or surprise. Even very slight emotions are captured.

This new technology could tremendously improve classroom learning. If a teacher had axcess to a technology like this,it could better help them understand where each student is in the lesson. For example if one,or more stundent showed signs of confussion the teacher could try to explain the lesson.

This could also help future video games and animated flims. Being able to really study human emotions could inprove the graphics of the games or films and make characters more expressive. Actors could also benefit from Facial Action Technology. Being able to study hundreds or human expressions could take acting careers to new heights.

In my opinion this would be a good idea for schools to use and make a more eficient way of teaching students and teachers differents ways to teach and learn making it more fun and less tireding for everyone. Although this may be expensive and students will not like a computer to read their emotions because it would be weird for them and it also may be unconterfull for students having a computer to just say their feelings in front of a class.

The Facial Action Coding System ( FACS) is a great idea for schools as I said earlier but I do not see how it could help in other things. The article describes how this new technology can identify human emotions but it does not explains how would it work in society or it will help people understand one another better.

The FACS can tell your emotions by the way the muscles in the face move making it easier for the computer to identify what emotion the human is felling. They use video imagery to create a new emotion- recognition software tracks these facial movemets. Also the new technology can identify mixed emotions.

The article also describes how by making a expression can make you feel slighty the expresion that was just used. According to Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. This may happen because weunconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to are face, while in the computer it shows it in how much it can do. In the computer imagine know when we are happy or even sad for example, if we smile when a Wed ad appears on are screen, a similar ad might follow. But if we frown, the next ad will be different.

When we are looking in the mirror:

* raise your lips at the corner of your mouth,

* when you squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes,

* when you hold it, rise the outer pars of your cheek up, toward your eyes,

In fact, these are instructionws for a face that looks happy.

In a real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at yourt cheek bones) lifts the corner of you mouth. (that's out instruction #1.)

To creat a Machine that can identify their emtion and action can be danger. because it's like taking their privicy away, also people would not feel said because they machine can indentify their emtion and their action. I don't think it's a effective thing to creat because many people will felt that their bein watch. to creat a Machine that can indentify people emtion and action is like taking their freedom form them. Also people can take advantage of this and invade other people privice.

This system can invade people privice and they won't fet safe. as it's show in the articles using video can track theri facial movemets in real face or in the painted face. Also it can identify their weight. Although this is a great invition thing for human It's still not efficted. because to able to figure people emotion and action it's not our problem. because it's like when your sibling go through your stuff that is privice. to able to figur out people privice can also destroy realtionship, because everbody has dark secerty.

In now day technology is develope more and more, somtime they can be usefull. Most of they time they can invade people privice and realtionship. It's not neccery to identiy people emtion because it's could be a private, or famiy problem.

to identify privice it's taking their right and freedom also people might not felt safe because they know bein spy. through out the invition this facial Action Coding is not most efficted invition. because they are usefull but in the other hand it's ruind people privice.

Although this Facial Action Coding system might be usefull for some people. I still don't think it's exclussice invition because this invition can destroy or take away people freedom. most people might not felt safe by their surrounding because they are bein watch. This Facial Action Coding System invition should not be well reconzied because it's can intamated other people relationship like family problem also it can deterimed their facial expressions, and can also reveal their emtion; Most people might felt that they are taking their privice and freedom form them.",2,7,0.7249823808670044
982f413,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Simile"" the author describes how a new technology called the facial action coding system enables computers to identify human emotions.

First, The author in the story ""making Mona Lisa Smile"" is telling us that a Dr. Huang is making a computer that shows emotional. It says that the computer has the ability to see how happy you are and sad and angry and all the emtionals in side your body all at once. It says that Dr. Huang was working with Dr. paul Eckman the creator of the Facs (facial action coding system). It says they both were working on a computer that could see the emitionals of other people.

Second, In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it talks about how they would process the computers 3-D constructs. It said in the artice that the human had 44 major muscles and it said in the midel must move like human muscles to see how they feel or react to this.

It says that Dr. Huang ""relies on the work of psychologist,"". It said that the two doctors had ""classified six basic emotions and that is happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facual muscles"". it says for ""example your frontails pars lateralis muscke (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when your surpised: your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"".

Third, it is talking about how the muscles of the 44 major muscles react to the emitions in the article of ""Making Mona Lisa Simle,"". It says that Dr. Huang observes that artist such as Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convery specific emotions. It says that Dr. Huang's emotion algorithns are a different soft of ""Da vinci code""! it aslo says that the new computer software stores siilar anatomical information as electronic code. It says that Dr. Huang's computer might have found out how computers can see how your feelings are.

In conclusion, This story about ""Making Mona Lisa smile,"" is trying to discuss that you can tell peoples feelings on a computer by getting an electroinc code. This story is also taling about how Da vinci was a artist that studyed emitional feelings with people that want a picuture of how they felt feelings. It said that the two doctors figured out that most artist study people for there feelings and to show how they felt about it. The studys show that you can see how a person feels on the computer by a code that goes their electric.",1,7,0.7808005213737488
983df9c,"In the most recent years, people have invented things that they have been planning for years. This article explains how the new system, the Facial Action Coding System, can read a person's emotions by only looking at the muscle movement of the face. This system can not only read one emotion of a person, but read all of their emotions. This will also be a way to know if someone has a real or false smile on. Lastly, it will be able to detect if a student is confused about a lesson in their class. With all of this information and the new technology that has been introduced to the world, this system might be able to accurately read somone's emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system created by Doctor Paul Eckman that can detect a person's emotions. In the painting of Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, Eckman has found out that Mona Lisa is portraying six emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, and fear. These six emotions could probably not have been detected by a person looking at another person. This system is very modern and with all of the new technology that is in our world, the FACS could be accurate. Most people are not capable of sensing how a person feels. There are times when people have the biggest smile on their face, but they are hiding the fact that they are sad and broken on the inside. Hopefully this new invention will help doctors and psychiatrists with their blank-faced patients.

According to this article, the system will be able to tell if a person has a false or real smile on. This will be helpful especially during political debates. When one person is rallying against the other, one of them will be yelling at the other and the other will look like they are listening, but they are not. Researches can differentiate between a real smile and a fake smile. If a person has a real smile on, their muscles at their cheek bones will lift the corners of the mouth. On the other hand, if the mouth is stretched sideways by the muscles by the cheek bones and another muscle, a person will have on a false smile.

Since the technology has developed greatly over the years, scientists might be able to create a system that will detect when a student is confused about a lesson. Some students do not say anything when they do not understand what the teacher is teaching them. This system will help the teacher to know when one of their students is struggling in their class. Also, it will allow the teacher to be notified when a student is bored or not paying attention. Not only will it benefit the teachers, but the students as well.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System will benefit many people. It will be able to read the emotions of people in paintings, people in general, students in class, and whether or not a person shows a real or false smile. This system will also help psychiatrists to know their patient's state of emotion and hopefully treat them with the right solutions and advice. Since new tecnologies are improved, this new system will be a big and famous invention.",4,7,0.8868459463119507

How long would it take for this project to happen, will it work, going through all this can be a problem, why would we need all this if we can ask one simple question to all the students ""Are you ok?"" Even if the school wants this we will need to take each of the students picture and modify it into a ""3-D computer model program"" as said in paragraph 3 we have 44 major face muscles which they will need to go into to that program and modify it. Every kid has mixed emotions one day they can be happy one day they can be sad, angry, and or stressfull. This Program can not improve or prove how us students are feeling, We would be happy and the computer program pops up with anti-depression pills, Computers are like us humans we mess up sometimes and we arent always right.

Like what i said we can ask the students directly without any expensive computer programs, with one little questions ""are you ok?"" ""Are you doing fine?"" ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/her face. we won't be needing these 3-D facial modifications, sometimes people can be smilling but deep inside they could be mad,sad, angry,glad. I don't think it matters about the face it matter about the heart, nobody can tell how you're feeling with just a face. If you're watching a sad movie and you're crying your happy but sad at the same time how can a computer program no that you're really not sad but happy. Just be cause our muscles movement proves how we feel it can be impossible for this Program to work in the future, it may sound like a good idea they can test but we have billions of people millions or schools how can this one program improve a school yes it shows and might help but how can it be possible.You can have 40 people in one room and have a computer look at there faces and see if they are mad,sad,or happy. They all will have

a straight face, In my opinion "" We as in humans can tell and sometimes not tell if he/she is happy or sad

98bf153,"The Facial Action Coding System is a new software that enables computers to identify human emotions. This software detects how other people are feeling even if they are trying to hide their emotions. Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute of Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, is the creator of this expectacular software. The use the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is helpful.

This computer software works with emotion algorithms. According to the passage, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, was tested with this software. A recent study shows that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry. The Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements. The text also states that this software can even identify mixed emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System is helpful at schools. With the help of this software, teachers could know when a student is sad or angry. This computer software can also detect mixed emotions. This new software could even save lifes. For example, nowadays with the bullying's situation, a teacher would detect when a student is being bullyied or if the student is under a depression. The teacher could help him and prevent any type of accident. The software can help at schoosl in other ways. The text states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Hung predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'""

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System has been developed that improves accuracy in perciving the emotions of others. Making faces reveal so much about the science of emotions. Becuase of this software, teachers could see when a student is sad or angry and the teacher could help him. The software could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

9941ca3,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" by Nick D'Alto, the author explains a new technology named the Facial Action Coding System which allows computers to identify emotions.

D'Alto uses credible evidence to prove the idea that this new technology is effective and valuable for students.

First, the author introduces the Facial Action Coding System and explains how it works.

D'alto talks about how the computer conducts a 3-D computer model of the human face, including all 44 of the major muscles in the human face.

It recognizes the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and coordinates these emotions to the person's facial muscles.

The creator of FACS, who is a psychologist, further explains in detail how these specific different face muscles work.

""Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprises.""

This quote supports the claim that this new technology is effective by exhibiting how the creator researched all of the human facial muscles.

Next, the author proceeds to talk about how humans perform the same ""calculation"" in day to day life.

By putting it into every day life, this makes the technology seem less far fetched.

""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face... artists such as Da Vinci studied human anatomy... and his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.""

This quote expertly supports the claim that FACS is an effective tecnhology by bringing it to the everyday life scale, and using credible evidence to show the efficiency of the anatomical information the computer stores.

Moving forward, now that it has been established that this new technology is effective, the next question brought up is if it is valuable for students.

The author then explains how much value this technology can actually bring to students and how this new technology will be indubitably helpful to students in the classroom.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor.""

This excerpt further proves the claim that FACS is valuable for students.

It brings the innovative idea forward and exhibits how it will be effectively used to help students customize their own learning experience.

The author expertly shows how the Facial Action Coding System could supercede the computers in today's society; it could very well be the future.

However, some people may read this article and see a few problems with it.

They may wonder how a computer can analyze everybody's facial expressions, if everybody's facial expressions are slightly different.

Fortunately, the creators have already thought of this problem, and conjured up a solution.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

This quote refutes any ideas of doubt about this new technology, and instills faith in the readers that their technology will be valuable.

In conclusion, D'alto expertly uses many pieces of credible evidence to support the claim that FACS will be effective and valuable to students.                ",4,7,0.8174046874046326
99491b5,"Boredom in the classroom is not rare. For many students, some lessons will be pretty boring and bland, making the the student less attentive and engaged. What if that can be changed with technology? What if the machine used to detect emotions in Da Vinci's artwork, the Mona Lisa, could be used to the students' benefits? The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can detect the students' emotions during the lesson, it can modify the lesson according to their emotions, and it is much more effective compared to a human.

This technology could be used to detect the students' emotions during the lesson. In the article in paragraph 4, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks the facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa.... Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" The author describes here how the machine works. It detects the muscles and the movements of s face and compares it to a neutral (no emotions) face in order to determine the emotion of the subject, whether it be a painting of a real life human. Using this device, the computer can be placed in a classroom and can be used to detect the students' emotions. This means as a teacher, they will know whether their lesson is making the students happy, sad, or angry. Using this new data that can be collected, it can make the students more engaged.

With the new data collected, this device can help make the students much more engaged in their learning by modifying the lesson according to emotions. As stated in paragraph 6, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" As described by the author, this technology could be used to make the marketing buisiness much more succesful. They can play more ads that are similar to the ones that made the viewer happy and play different ones if the viewer seemed to be unhappy. This concept can be taken and implemented into a classroom. The computer can use the emotion detecting data and modify the lesson to where it will be towards the students' liking. With this device, it will be much easier to understand the students and make the classroom more enjoyable. It can even introduce a new system of learning.

This device can provide a much better substitute for a teacher. In paragraph 5, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that converys happy, worried, etc.... His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code."" The author describes how humans make this same ""calculation"" every single day since we can sometimes identify when a friend is sad or happy. However, humans are not as good at calculating emotions as this device is. Humans could have trouble determining facial traits that convey specific emotions, which is why the device is much more effective. This new device that can provide a much better learning experience with modified lessons can even replace human teachers. It's accurate data and superior understanding of the students compared to humans proves that it is a much better teacher.

In conclusion, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. It can detect the students' emotions during the lesson, it can modify the lesson according to their emotions, and it is much more effective compared to a human. With the Facial Action Coding System, it can pave a path towards a new learning system, one where kids will enjoy being in a classroom rather than falling asleep. One where students will actually want to learn rather than be forced to learn. ",5,7,0.8440266847610474

The use the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is valuable, because it will benefit both students and teachers. This technology will help teachers identify if their students are understadning the lesson and if their students are enjoying the lesson and staying engaged.

The Facial Action Coding System will help teachers identify if their students are understanding the lesson they are teacher. In paragraph 6 the author states,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huange predicts."" Teachers could use this technology to monitor their student's facial expression when watching a video or an online lesson. Teachers could ensure that all their students are understanding the content they are teaching. Teachers will be able to modify their lessons and how they are taught based on their students' reactions. They could also insturct their students to take notes on these computers, so that the teacher can identify if their students are fully engaged or not.

Teachers will be able to understand if their students are enjoying the lesson or not with the Facial Action Coding System. The author states, "" The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video or video surgrey."" This technology will not only help students and teachers understand each other better, but will help students have more fun as well. Teachers will have the ability to show more interesting and engaging videos and online simulations to their students, so that they will stay engaged and focused on the lesson. It will give teachers the ability to monitor the enjoyment of their students, so that they will be able to modify their lessons t o help keep their students happy and focused. This will also help teachers make their future lessons more enjoyable or less depending on the reactions of their students.

In reality, our human are performing the same impressive every day, just like the article said:""You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" We can observe the emotions from people who are around us every day, we can describe they are happy or make something troubles.

Everyone of us have a conversation everyday, we can learn the personality through people's emotion during the school. We can not only use the languague to talk, but also can use the emotion to have a communication, just like the people who can not talk to each other, but they still can use the emotion to expression their feelings.

In this article, Dr. Huang observes da Vinci also studied human anatomy to help him to paint facial muscles predcisely enough to convey specfic emotions. This imagine demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, just like the computer knows you are happy or sad. If you are following the Web ad appears, then there will have a similar ad comeout. But if you do not follow it, they will change a different for you.

When we have a classroom computer, it will recognize us is bored or confused about it, then it could modify the lesson, just like an effective human instructor. The emotions have a big effect during the class, we should learn how to read the emotional expressions and also manage our emotion better.

The mirror shows in this article is important too, it suggest an emotion when we have expression. Actually it is all about the muscular action units. When we have a meanwhile, our muscle make crow's-feet around your eyes. But our muscle will change to stretched when we have a wrong smile. So the muscle makes our smile truthful beacuse our faces do not lie.

A drama coach had his actors carefully produce smiling and creating emotions on stage. Your face shows happy even though you do not happy, but it still an help you to produce the happy muscle. For example, even you are not happy, but you are effected by the people who are making a happy face to you, you still can change your emotion even a little bit.

The new technology can help everyone all around the world in different ways to find different kinds of information about a person. Like their peronality based off of wheather or not they are angry, sad, or just happy. I believe that you would be able to tell alot about a person based off of their emotions.

In the text the author talks about how Mona Lisa's emotions were very different when Davinci had made his master piece of her. It is said that her emotions were 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The reason I think the new technology would be able to tell alot about a person by their emotions is because the advanced computer can pick up 4 different emotions altogether. One of those emotions are going to have a bigger percentage om the person than others depending on how they are feeling.

I think that the new technology can come to a conclusion of helping eveyone improve the society we live in today. Because every one has different feelings and thoughts about many different things that are going on. If the technology was used to find out how people are feeling about those different things that are going on then they could help to give ideas to make those changes.

Some times it work because some people would now how to keep it up and nothing would happen to it but if something did happen to it they wold know how to fits it real fast then you would be able to use it again if not you could build a new one if you would want too.

They would show you if your really happy or surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness by using the new technology that they built for you to see if you feel bad or anything you need to. now if you don't now already.

They might even make you look at youself in the mirror even if you don't really want to so you can see what you look like even if you really don't want to look at your face even though you look pretty.

If they make a paintting of you would keep beause you should it will make you have some feeling inside your body telling you that you are very pertty and you should be happy about it but if you think that you are very ugly then their is something wrong with you cause everyone is pertty in thier own ways even if you think your not.",1,7,0.595936119556427
9b11f52,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology created by Dr. Huang is revolutionary in its ability to understand human emotion. It uses anatomical science to read and identify the emotions portrayed on the face of its subject. This technology can be beneficial in many different aspects of human life and society. Although some would argue that facial recognition software is not beneficial in a classroom, the use of the Facial Action Coding System is incredibly valuable by helping the student's learning and understanding, better replicating human teachers, and allowing the student to express feeling even in online learning.

Technology has always been used to improve the education of students. Using the Facial Action Coding System could help many student's ability to understand the idea being taught. For instance, the text states that the program would be able to identify when a student is confused or even bored. The program could then change the lesson in order to further help the student's understanding of the subject being taught. The technology would be incredibly beneficial in this way.

The Facial Action Coding System could also help online instruction by allowing computers to better replicate human instructors. If the computer were able to know when a student was having trouble with a subject, it could offer more assistance with the student's learning, similarly to a human teacher. The lessons after this could also be affected in order to help the student's learning based on what the student was having trouble with previously. Online learning would become much more intuitive with FACS.

The Facial Action Coding System could also allow the student to better express themself during learning. In a setting where it is often difficult to convey complex messages quickly, the FACS could help a student immediately alert the program that they did not understand the taught material. This could be helpful to many students of online learning.

While the Facial Action Coding System is not being utilized yet, one day, it could be used to better the education of students. In doing this, many students would have greater opportunity in their futures. The Facial Action Coding System could revoluionize the education of students.",4,7,0.8785605430603027
9b20905,"The use of FACS technology to read student's emotional expressions are valuable. FACS, made by Prof. Thomas Huang and his collague, was made to detect emotions in paintings or in humans. According to Dr.Huang, "" facial expressions for each emotion are univesal,"" which is why the new technology is used to find out what these expressions mean. FACS can detect facial expressions in paintings such as Mona Lisa. The computer can recognize what kind of emotions are expressed in the painting when most people can't. Humans can also perform this action when we look at a family or a friend's face, it is easy to tell how they're feeling by looking at their face. The computer also makes emotions look more realistic in video games. According to Dr. Eckman, the computer has six emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Furthermore, when students are in a classroom learning for hours or even minutes, they get bored, confused, or even annoyed. Teachers can sometimes realize that and sometimes they can't which is how the computer can help. Simply by looking at sudents, it reads their emotions and when it realizes learning is not fun for them anymore, it changes things. Accoring to the text, a classroom computer will detect that the students are feeling bored. How the computer helps is by changing how the teacher is teaching the students. It modifies the teaching area to create a new way to teach students.

To end it all, FACS is resourceful for anyone. With the emotions it has, it can easily read people's face and recognize what type of emotions they have. It also helps students and teachers a lot by creating new amusing ways for students to learn. People can't always know what other people are feeling by looking at their face but the computer can. It's an upgrade made by professors and doctors to help society and people. ",3,7,0.8646904826164246
9b4d62a,"Modern day technology can identify human emotions. One very strong claim and great example is the 3D computer model. It begins when the computer constructs the model of a human face or painting.

Leonardo da Vinci, a famous artist, painted The Mona Lisa, but new technology computer software can recognize emotion, according to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. The 3D computer model can construct all 44 major muscles in the humans body, but it must move like human muscles. The movent of one or more muscles during this process is called an ""action unit"". According to Dr. Huang, ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", even though some individuals often show varying degrees of expression.

When using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can track facial movements in a real face in a student or painting. Weighing in different units, the software can identify mixed emotions because each experssion is compared against a neutral face. For instance, in person, you can probably tell how someone is feeling simply by the look on his/her face. Scientists and Professors today would go over types of human emotions through the 3D computer model.

The home PC you own can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's or any humans smile. The Facial Action Coding System only enables lab computers or computers at a University to identify human emotions. This same technology is used to make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.

In conlusion, modern day technology can identify human emotions through a 3D computer or The Facial Action Coding System.

On paragraph eight of this paasage it states that faces don't lie. while I do think that is true I do not think we are at a point where this technology can be accurate enough for us to be able to determine our emotions. Although I do not think it is accurate right now I do believe that in the future technology will able to accurately read our faces and find our emotions and this article shows why and how it is possible.

The first way that this passage shows us how emotion reading is possible is by bringing us an example in paragraph one of the Mona Lisa. The paragraph says that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This example right here is meant to show us how the technology can work but brings us more questions that we hopfully get answers for. In paragraph three lots of backround information is given to us so that we can get an idea on how they were able to determine what the emotions of the girl in painting are. the author talks about the main emotions humans show and how technology can now allow us to mimick the muscles that humans have in their face and the movments they can make. In paragraph four the author elaborates a bit more on the technology and how it can be used to search for those mixed emotions. The author cites quotes from Dr. Huang, one of the main people behind the project, in order to give insight to the readers who may not fully belive that reading emotions through technology is possible. In paragraph five it states that if everday normal humans can also read at the very least the basics of human emotions based on how a human looks. It could most certainly be possible for a computer to do it but better as well. In paragraph six Dr. Huang talks about the possible futures this technology can go with more advances. He says that if your computer can read your emotions it can help a student with their homework or exlcude ads that do not appeal to that person. He also discusses about how versatile the technology is and that it can be used in order to improve the facial exressions for characters in video games while maintaining a more realsitic look that many video games have. In the last two paragraphs it shows how you can try to recognize some emotions yourself like a computer would.

I do think that this technology will go somewhere and has the potential to be able to with the rate that it is going. Being able to read the emotions of the girl in the Mona Lisa is already an impressive accomplishment. For the time being we will have to wait and see where it goes but I know that I as well as many others are very excited to see when this type of technology will be integrated with everyday life.",2,7,0.7376489639282227

The system can classifiy six basic emotions happiness, anger, surprise, disgust ,fear, and saddness. Also, it can help people that has disablities that can't speak their emotions.

We live in a world where tiny robots can act and do anything we want, with just a click of a button. Now we live in a world where we have the ability to detect every single feeling a person is expressing, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is brand new technology that allows us to detect accurate and precise emotions of others. What does this mean for the future?

FACS is the newest Facial innovation that allows us to read the most hidden emotions. ""Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman institute for Advanced Science and Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam."" Introduced this new and advanced technology. Huang and Sebe are always finding better ways for computers and humans to interact. Have you ever spoken to someone who was just a blank slate; no emotion, no expession, nothing? Facial Action allows us to dig deeper and help those who have trouble expressing emotions with the people they interact with everyday. Secondly, have you ever gone to the doctor and didn't know how to explain how you felt? With FACS we can now detect feelings in which we can't explain maybe even feelings we don't want to explain.

With this kind of advanced technology one must be careful. Is it not always the best choice to see what others are feeling, maybe they simply don't want help or want others to know what they are feeling. For example, when asked the following question; if you could pick any superpower what would you pick? Most would say super strength, super speed etc. One might even say the ability to read minds. But after given that ability, some might want to reverse the clock. When we are given high technology or ""superpowers"" we have to keep in mind the risk of such information. We may learn things we never wanted to learn or things we should have never come in contact with.

Every new technology that the world presents has pros and cons; but our job is to be able to weigh out these conditions so that everyone is happy with the outcome. Just because something benefits one human that doesn't mean it can benefit everyone it comes in contact with. For when given great power comes great responsibilty.   ",3,7,0.8037481307983398

teen suicide rates have been going up as the rise of social medias and the internet has increased,but with

the facial action coding system we could try to combat this trend by implementing it in ways that could benefit these suicidal teens.Many teens come to school upset or get upset during the school day but don't like to go to their counselors for help.Some of the main reasons why students don't like to go to their counselors are things such as: fear of their parents getting involved, fear of other students picking on them or judging them because they need to see a guidance counselor,and a belief that an adult couldn't possibly know what they are going through because adults didn't grow up in an age where most people use social media which tends to set standards that few can actually achieve.The Facial Action Coding System would allow counselors to be notified of students that are feeling upset so that they can try and help these students in need.Have you ever felt like your life wasn't worth anything because their were so many people that were better than you? Well this is a mentality that many high school students have so instead of getting help they just allow themselves to stay unhappy because the don't want to inconvenience someone who is actually worth something.

There has been a massive spike in student's shooting up school's and in most cases it is because the student felt that the school,or its students just watched as they suffered from sadness or other issues, but usually it is just that no one realized what they were going through.Teenagers have become good at hiding their true emotions from others because they try to live up to some stereotypical standard such as the stereotype that real men do not cry, or the stereotype that women only want tough guys so if you want a women then you need to be a jerk that seems to not care about her.Many women also suffer from these standards that they believe they need to live up to such as the false belief that all women should be thin,or the belief that they need to wear makeup to cover their face because if they don't then guys won't be attracted to them.The Facial Action Coding System would allow the counselors to be aware of when these pressures were sapping a student of their happiness,and try to help lift the weight presented by these pressures off of the student's back.If we can help these students that feel this way than we would have happier students which would decrease the violent trend of school shooting that is on the rise.

School is like a sport in that in the end everyone is working towards the same goal of keeping society going and flourishing, so by keeping the students happier you are benefitting society as a whole.Humans have a tendency to link happiness with productivity so in theory happier students lead to more productive students,and more productive students become more involved members in society.

depression is linked to many health issues such as paranoia which hinder people by making it hard for them to function in normal society.depression related health issues can also lead to drug abuse because students try to find a way to make themselves happy and there is a stigma that drugs will make you feel good so they try to use the substances as an escape from their life.drugs cause many students to put more effort into getting the next dose of the drug than they do on being sucessful in life.

If you have ever been to school than you would most likely notice that many students find school boring and unecessary,this method of thinking could be directed to a more positive one if school could be more tailored towards what the student thinks will be important or what they find interesting.The facial action coding system could help make this a reality for students as it could be used

to detect when a student is feeling bored or annoyed at the presented work and notify a teacher. This would allow the teacher to try and help the frustrated student, because many times students may not understand something but don't want to ask about it for fear that they may get ridiculed by the teacher or other students.

9ecd631,"Intro-

This new facial software could be the next step to communicate with people without the use of words. Created by Prof. Thomas Huang and collaberated with Prof. Nicu Sebe, they have inventited a computer software that can reconongnise what a human's emotion's are (Par. 1). The new software would scan the 44 major muscles of the person, it can detect wether the person is lieing about what they are feeling or not (Par. 3). This facial software would change the way we see people, as it shows what people really are feeling.

Body-

The software created by Prof. Huang and Sebe is reliable on computers. It would scan the face and construct a 3D model of the students face with all 44 major facial mucles and would have to have a phychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman to judge the appereance of the face to see if it shows the 6 emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise (Par.3). This could help tell the emotions of students or if they are telling the truth on how they feel. Any student is bound to be emotional, the scanning system would be able to tell which emotion is being told because certain muscles would be activated in the face (Par. 8). These uses seem very standard but are they useful?

With only being able to scan faces, there really is not much use to this. People can already judge other people's facial expressions by noticing key differences to how someone smiles, if they are faking it or not (Par. 7). There are already lie detector tests that can prove if someone is telling the truth or not, which seems like the most cheap option. Though it doess have many uses, it can properly tell someones facial features with emotions. Better than most people can judge, a computer will be able to show what a specific person is feeling. Since humans are universal, most scanning will be accurate at telling people's emotions (Par. 4). Of course the purpose of this facial scaning can be anything us humans can already do for eachother, but the software has full knowlege of what we are feeling.

Conclusion-

The software can change our view on how we see eachother. All uses for this softtware are amazing but with even our own selves mostly capable of judging others and being accurate, it makes this software useless. We humans can already tell what we are feeling, we know ourselves better than any computer. Even phycologists have to properly tell what the emotions are and they are human not software (Par.3). This could be benifical but there are already lie detector tests that can be more accurate as it even measures pulse, which can differ with emotion. There are more downsides than upsides, but who is to say that this software wont improve in the future?",4,7,0.8394500017166138
9efb395,"Can you believe there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can identify your emotion? I believe this system would be outstanding to use in a classroom because this system can look at a students face and determine their emotion. Just like any new system there are going to be advantages and disadvantages, so those need to be taken into consideration. In summary, I stongly believe that schools should begin using the Facial Action Coding System in school.

What is the Facial Action Coding Sysytem and how does it work? This system is a computer that builds a 3-D computer model of the face that you are testing. Then, the computer analyzes the face movement. For instance, when the muscle above the eye moves and

eyebrows are rasied the emotion is conveyed as suprised. Now, there are also many other emotions that the computer can read like happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In summary, this system is a process that works by analyzing a face and the face movements of a person to determine their emotion.

There are

many outstanding reasons why this program could be valuable for students in a classroom. First of all, this system can show how students are feeling. When a student is feeling sad or scared someone will know and they can help the student that is feeling those emotions. In addition, this program shows many emotions. For instance, a student will know when another student is happy, sad, suprised, angry, scared, or disgusted. Now, most of all classrooms have the shy students who are scared to talk, so by using this, the students teacher or other classmates can recognize the shy students emotion and help them through it. In wrap, students and teachers would be able to talk more easily about their emotions with one another by using this program.

Using the Facial Action Coding System could potentially be useless for students to use in schools. Many people aroud the world use different facial expressions for different emotions. By using this program, it could become inaccurate due to students not using similar expressions for each emotion. For example, some students don't smile as broadly as others so they may not be considered as happy as other students convey. Now, home PC's can't handle complex algorithms, so how is a teachers outdated PC going to handle this program? Many teachers still use PC's that are out of date and very ancient, so teachers won't be able to demonstrate how this emotion reading system opperates. In addition, students may also not be able to utilize this system becasue their PC might be unable to handle complicated algorthisms as well.

The Facial Action Coding System could become valuable to students in classrooms. Although the system has many disadvatages like reading an emotion inaccuratly; I strongly believe that this system could work wonders for students in classes everywhere. In summary, because of the ability to recognize many emotions, this program could become extremely valuable to students in classrooms all around the world.",4,7,0.9178380966186523

9f244ee,"When looking at the Facial Action Coding System and seeing what it did for this peinting, I think it would be a great idea to use in the classrooms to reqd the students emotional expressions. Dr. Haung observes that many artists likr da Vinci did, and he relized that tney studied human anatomy, this is how they were abel to paint facilmuscles precisely. Dr. Haung relized that by haveing a machine like this one, doctors would be abel to performe better surgery by useing video surgery and or better graphics for video games, beter quality images of human faces and better muscel pictures would become a huge hit in the medical field.

Dr. Eckman and Dr. Haung were both abel to figure out that if you raise your lips at the corner of your mouth, squint your eyes slightly, and raise the outer parts of your cheeks toward your eyes, your lab partner would be clueless on what emotion you were performing. These are the instructions on how to look happy says Dr. Haung. The Facial Action Coding System can even detect when you are forcing a fake smile instead of a real simle.

This is why I feel that putting the Facial Action Coding System into schools acros the globe would be a good thing. Not only would this give the schools feed back on how their students mental state changes throughout the day, but also this machine would help detect early signs of depression and posibly signs of bullying. When students tell teachers they are not getting bullied or hurassed, the Facial Action System might be abel to detect when a student is lying an d or not wanting to share all of the details in his or her life.

These are all the reasons I personally think the Facial Action Coding System should be placed in schools everywhere. People were interested in the face and how the mucels work even whe da Vinci was alive all the way to today when we are atill intdrested in how the fave and muscels not only work, but how they can be minipulated and how each emotion brings on different muscels.

9f32834,"The Use Of Technology To Read Students Emotional Expressions In A Classroom

I believe that using this technology ""Facial Action Coding System"" to read students emotional expressions in a classroom is not right because that's like taking advantage of the students privacy on what they could be thinking and looking at. Watching the students faces and not understanding them and why they have the face expression and then using the Facial Action Coding System to help you determine the feelings or the mood could be harmful due to the fact that what if that students had something they didn't want to say or want anyone to know about, but the teacher made it their business to figure out what was wrong by using a technology that could help them.

I found my evidence in paragraph 5 and how I know this is because it states that ""We humans perform this same impressivde ""calculation"" everyday which mean we have the same face everyday that no one seems to read but for instance some people can tell a friends emotions by just looking at there face and even the look they might have gave or had."" This could also be used in different by mixed emotions that someone might have and can be compared against a netural face.

The new technology software stores similar anatomical inofrmation as a electric code that help the teachers study the students and paint a facial muscles. Precisely just enough to convey the specific emotions as most students can have a nonverbal emotion including communication so using the computers to figure that out is to under the complex algorithms to determine the mood of each student in th classroom.

The new technololgy could modify the lesson like a human instructor for example Dr. Huang predicts that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" could be really good use becuase he feel that the painting of Mona Lisa inspired him to recognize studetns emotional expression in a classroom on wtheater if they are bored or feeling behind, and using this technology could prevent the confusion.

As I came to my conclusion I noticed that in a way it would be good to use the new technoolgy but in reality it wouldn't help with anything because at the end of the day trying to read students emotional expressions in in a classroom could be real life stressful I wouldn't want that kind of pressure on any teacher to if they try and read a students expression adn they figure out something they didn't want to know it could be bad on there part. In other words I wouldn't want this new technology in any school becauswe that's too much troubloe to go through with ebery single student an trying to figure out the students emotional state.

The Facial Action Coding System has percieved the emotions of Mona Lisa and has tryed to accuratly grade the percentage of each emoition from the picture. The program bases off of 6 basic emotions which fall in to more complicated catagories. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles no only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them.

The program is going off of the physical emtion but not the mental emotion the person is having. This flaws the percentages overall. Being another individual you can see what the persentages are and agree with them by looking at the picture in person. The mental emotion of someone may be a lot diffrent then what they are expressing physically.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System may be a bit flawed but has improved accuracy quite a lot.

9f4696c,"Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to bad until there comes a day where you want no one knowing how you're feeling. In the article, the author explains what this technology can do. So far, the article does a job identifying your emotional expressions, ""according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I am against the value of using this technology to read students thoughts or feelings. There are days when you want your own thougths and feelings kept to yourself, privacy, and as well as being able to learn something new everyday.

There come days when you don't want peope knowing how you're feeling and for some odd technology to just assume your feelings is just not adding up to me. The article shows a picture of the young Mona Lisa sort of smiling. Yes, she doesnt seem to happy, but is she? Only she knows. I dont agree with the computer system judging her feelings. ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfull, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto 1). To me, she looks like she's being forced to smile but like I said, only she knew her feelings while the picture was being taken. I don't believe that should be a thing, no one should be told how they are feeling. If we as humans dont really have a reason to judge, why should technology be able to.

Along with that, the article talks about ""a classroom computer could recogize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto 1). Recognizing it could allow teachers to change their lessons, due to students being bored. How come? Daily there are students who complain about how boring a class is. No one forces them to come. Students come to school to learn, we don't expect to have fun. If a technology were to let teachers know when students were bored they'd be changing subjects seconds, by seconds. Students in that case, would be happy to act bored just for the sake of it. Less learning would accure if it were for the technology to detect kids who don't care about school who are constantly ""bored"". No one said school is fun, but neither should a technology detecting students feelings should get in the way of learning.

In the meantime, we have trouble understanding people. To allow a technology to have the power to easily understand thoughts, feelings of us humans is just critical. Allowing a technology to determine your friend's feelings is overrated according to my calculations. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisly enough to convey specific emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I don't believe something so ordinary could barge in and make us feel disturbed knowing not someone but something knows the way we're feeling.

Therfore, I am against this value of using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions. I believe there are different types of people in this world. There are days where you don't want to share your feelings to people, so why technology. If we are willing to share our thoughts, we will.

Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague are the specialists in development of better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

Can we calculate the emotion by using the computer? Of course,we can calculate the emotion by using the computer. Dr. Paul Eckman create the FACS(Facial Action Coding System).Eckman classified six basic emotions ;happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness that are associated with the facial muscles movement. The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in classroom have advantages and disadvantages.""A class room comuter could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Haung predicts. So, we can give them the appropiate lessons that make them happy and fun. In that way, we can improve the students needs in the school. Today,most of the student rely on the technologies and social media. Most of the social media today are intend to the bad. Most of the students use their phones to communicate each others. Therefore, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. People are rather talking with the phones than face to face. Therefore we can't see their face and we don't know how to help them. By using the FACS to the classroom,we can help the student who need help. Our face can't lie our genuine emotion. According to the article ""Facial Feedback Theory of emotion show that moving our facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may eben help produce them. How do we produce the smiles. For instance, when we see the ad that is the ad of pizzas, in our mind we want to eat them when we see it. Like that ,using the FACS can help our student by making some funny movies to the sad students and making motivation speeches to the depress students. Most of our students are facing worries and fear because in our country has so many stress. And teachers should know their students situation and so they can help at least they don't know their students problems. And a genuine smile can infect to the others.

He knew that human can imitate other person facial expression.

Many may argue that the new facial action coding system leads the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable this is shown by, Mona Lisa being able to be reconized by compters even though she's a painting, computer can knowlege the students faces and lastly, the computers can make you happy.

Firstly, Mona Lisa is being able to be reconized by computer even though she is a painting. Dr. Paul Eckman made a system where computers unlock themselves and consisders your emotion by your facial expressiona and the tempertures from your body. Nick states, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (D' Alto 1). This quote show that the computers saw her facial expression and determined how she was feeling. It also shows that the computers can see anyones face and unlock any device.

Secondly, computer can reconize their faces and only unlock for the students. The system would be very useful in school because it will determine the students facial expreesion and alert the teacher or the computer if the student needs help or is having a difficult time with their work. Nick states, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D' Alto 6). This quotes shows that the teachers will have a easier time teaching and knowing which student will need help by the computer alrting them and showing that they need help.

Lastly, the computer can make the students more happy. Making smiley to your computer can make you more happy. Moving your facial muscels expresses more emotions. Nick states, ""According to Facial Feedback Thoeory of Emotion, moving your facial muscels not only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them"" (D' Alto 9). This quote shows that making faces at your computer can make your emotions change and feel better.

In conclution, computers can help the students and schools just by facial expressions. In todays world we have phones that easily unlock itself just by looking at it. Many may argue that emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable, it is, because it will help the students learn more from the computers knowleging that they need help.

Well with technologies like Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman's FACS or Facial Action Coding System, that is quite possible. With a technology that is able to read and recognise facial expressions, it can help improve students online lectures and help them pay attention and focus. A technoloy like FACS that can read emotions through facial msucle movment would provide the education system with a better way to connect to the students and aid in their emotional focus to the lectures and assignments providing a valuable aid to student education.

Even though humans can already perform similar actions, being able to tell what those around you are feeling by looking at their face. Humans can only ""calculate"" how such individuals are feeling and many fail to get a appropriate calculation. As Dr. Huang notes, "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" so for a computer to be able to read nonverbal expressions is very helpful as most students are kept to themselves. A computer with the FACS tecnonly would be able to recongize a studetns needs when learning on line. As Dr. Huang states, "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored [allowing the computer] to modity the lesson."" This ability to recognize emotions through facial movment can help improve the students performance by modifying lessosn to meet their educational needs. As some students already have trouble focusing in class and loose attetnion when lessons are boring or they just simply don't understand. Technologies like FACS provide the students with an adaptive and responsive system that will help them improve their focus and learn more affectively.

On the other hand some people may argue that technologies like FACS are an invasion of privacy. Or that these technologies can not really tell your emotions. These technologie dont do anything millions and millions of people do not already do everyday, read facial expression. The is what tecnologies like FACS do they read and recognize facial movments to determine emotion. Just like all of us do when trying to figure out the feelings of those around us. These techonlogies use a complex level of facial recognition invented and tested by proffesionals like Dr. Huang. As well as Dr. Paul Eckman who studies anatomatical movments and sturcutres. Being able to classify six basic emotions those being, "" happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". Even though these six can not analyzse every single emotion it will analyzse the one expressed the most.

So overall technologies like FACS which are able to read facial muslce movments are benefitail to student learing. A technoloy capable of adapting to analysed human emotion will help studnets learn , focus and feel more attented to in their learning. By identifying the emotion these technologies can also help teachers and guidecne counselors work towards aiding those students which are emotinally depressed and need help but wont verbally say it.

I feel this is a waste of time because we already have video call and facetime and these apps are more acurate than the Facial Action Coding System.

In this passage it states that by moving your muscles may not show your true emotion or face expresions, it just goes by how your muscles move in your face. This makes so much sene because we are all as humans have different musles, for example if a baby were to make a face expression and you mocked the baby your facial expression wouldn't exact turn out to be the same, which means your emotion could also be diferent when really it could possibly be the same emotion. In section 4 it states that humans have different ways to express themselves through different emotion, but then says these muscles can detect that, but if your not showing thee correct facial expression then the technology still wouldn't know your emotions.

In my opinion, theres enough technology in this world. Technology isnt always accurate either which could either be a good thing or bad. I feel we wouldn't even use this the facial coding system because society is so hooked on apps and facetime that they wouldnt even understand why they would need this app. Technology is overcoing society and is turning out to be a bad thing, these's barely any communication anymore or braceness when it comes to speaking out in front of people.

Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it tells you six basic emotions. Which are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. This technology will be able to tell how students are doing at school or in there daily lives. It can let other people be aware what they need in order to live a good life. This system can reveal so much about the science of emotions.

Another thing is that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Like for example ''putting on a happy face'' actually works! In the article it states that ''A reowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage''. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Thats why this technology will be useful cause in the article they showed an example of when you are looking in the mirror you have to do an expression.

Following that being said it asks you if it suggests an emotion. These are the instructions for a face that looks happy. It's all about those muscular action units. It can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. When it comes to experts , faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ''smiling'' politican or celebrity isn't being truthful.",2,7,0.8829770088195801
a0a15e3,"Would you feel comfortable standing in front of a computer and letting it try to figure out how you feel?And how would a computer that can read someones emotions help them in the classroom?Although technology has been great in the past few years,can we do better in our classrooms.I say yes with this valuable technology that can read students emotions.

So how would this work? The computer would first construct a 3-D model of the face,with all 44 major facial muscles.Then the model must move like human muscles,this movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit.""Afterward you use the six classified basic ""emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness.""These are associated with each characteristic movements of facial muscles.For example,your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised.

Why would this technology be valuable?Because will be able to see emotions that other people may not.Like for instance,your in a math class and the teacher is teaching the class on algebra.Your doing well until he starts to ramble about how he loves algebra and you lose focus.Then that is when the computer could recognize that your are confused and remind you what you were doing.The same can be said with any class not just math.Say your are at home and don't understand the history homework.Then computer sees this and sends you to website that can help you understand the subject.

The last reason why the FACS is valuable is to recognize emotions that people can't.Because most human communication is nonverbal we may not be able to know exactly how someone feels.But with FACS we are able to detect exactly how someone feels,even when they are trying to hide their emotions. For instance,an ordinary human being they are not able to see the muscular action units,these determine a genuine smile from a fake one,so they will not be able to tell how you truly feel.They will only see what you show them on your face.But FACS is able to use facial software to convey how you feel based on your facial muscular movement.

Now that all of that was said.Do you now see how it is valuable to students and schools?And not even schools but to people in the workforce.This can improve the way we communicate with each other.Beacause we will know how they really feel and then we will start to care more about each other's feelings.This is why I belive this technology is valuable to read students' emotionsl expressions.",4,7,0.8772671818733215
a0d3aa1,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author very well explains on how a future technology innovation called Facial Action Coding System will be able to indicate the emotions of a human being sitting in front of a computer screen. I say this is a pretty outrageous but innovative system but here is some evidence to back that up.

First of all, the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is able to detect the 6 basic emotions of a human being such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In the article, Author Nick D'Alto says,""the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Meaning, that the computer can recognize the movements of your facial muscles to be able to determine your emotions. Examples of muscle movements to indicate your emotions are like raising your eyebrows. That can indicate that you're surprised. Or how around your mouth can tighten up, that can mean you're angry.

On the other hand, I feel like this system of being able to determine a human beings' emotions by facial expressions may seem a little faulty. Due to the fact that there will always be more than one person in this planet who has the ability to hack into the system of an adult or even a child and potentially put that person at a risk of danger. Referring back to Paragraph 6, I feel like if this Facial Action Coding System was to come into play of our daily activities through technology, it should stay in an educational public environment such as a library or a school. Even then, I still feel like we need to receive some sort of permission to access this type of computer software due to the fact it seems like some high quality program.

Back to my claim, I feel like this software program would actually be pretty unique not only to test it out but to really know that the system itself does function properly. You can only imagine how chidren are going to react seeing that type of technology around them. Even without using the system, humans perform the same type of ""impressive calculations"" everyday. For instance, if you're really close with a person it's like you can immediately tell how that person is feeling by looking at their facial expression. For example, if you walk into a room and see your friend with their head down and eyebrows lowered, you can kind of get a hint that your friend isn't feeling too well.

In the article, it speaks about how about if you look in the mirror and make a particular facial expression referring to a basic human emotion, you can potentially start to feel that emotion. Like if you were to just stand in front of the mirror smiling, you would start to feeling happy or boost your mood a little bit.

Overall, I feel like the Facial Action Coding System is a pretty unique program in helping humans interact more with computers. Although I also feel like there are some major concerns about the software, it can help us understand more and more of the technology that us humans have around us.",4,7,0.8798799514770508
a0e57ff,"I'm going to type an essay about an arugement for this technology to read students emotional expressions. The newest software update is called Facial Action Coding System. I really feel like this type of technogoly would be really helpful.

There is a lot of prons and cons to this technogoly because some students may not want you to know how they are feeling or what there emtions are, I feel as if some students need the help or may feel, let's say lonely but don't like saying they are so they fake a smile but those are the students who really need someone to know. So I'm going ot start out in my first paragraph saying why I think it would be good to have this type of system.

My first paragraph is going to be my first reason why I feel that it would help and a little bit about the software. The software update has promising applications for a variety of industries. The computer constrcuts a 3-D computer model of the face all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. I feel that it will help a lot more with young teenagers in our generation.

A lot of people in our generation are going through depression and they don't like to telling people about it, so if you have this software it would help kids from sucide thoughts or some things like that.

Another reason why it woud be helpful is because you could use it on anyone not just students. My first reason why I think it would be a brillant idea would be an example such as this, if you went to class one day and seen your friend upset you would be able to look at her and know shes upset but if you asked her and she said no I'm fine, she would be lying. If you had this software update and you used it on your friend it would say she is 70 percent upset and 30 percent mad. So now you know she is upset most of the time and you could change that by talking about things with her letting her parents know. Little things like that could change someones life forever.

My last reason I think it would be helpful is because you would know how everyones feeling. The Mona Lisa is to demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while showoing how much a computer can do. It also says in paragraph 6 that ""

A classroom computer could recogonize when a student is becoming bored or confused"". That could also help the teacher out a lot. Some students don't always let the teacher know if they are bored or confused because maybe they are scared or embarssed, but now your teacher would know if you were confused about something. She would be able to help you or do something a little more exciting.

My conclusion paragraph is going to wrap up my essay. As I said in the introduction I think this would be a really good idea for this software update to be in classrooms for teacher and students. I think it would help with teenagers. I gave a couple reasons why I would want this software update or why it would help. I have seen a lot of students falling asleep in class and the teacher just keeps going. I have also been one of those students were I'm really confused but I don't want to say in front of the class so I either don't say anything or I say something to my buddy next to me. Those are my reasons why I am for this Facial Action Coding System.                  ",3,7,0.8107069730758667
a1028ad,"Is it possible for us to identify human emotions with just a simple picture? Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, is working with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam to make a software that is able to recognize the human emotions on Leonardo da VInci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa.

You may wonder how a computer can recognize facial movements that we use to express our feelings. Well this computer makes a 3-D model of the face. By this point Dr. Huang gives the work over to a psychologist such as Dr. Paul Eckman, who is the creater of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions such as; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All of those feelings are associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

Sometimes we can notice these expressions on our own friends almost every day. Then again we might also end up reading their expression wrong, because we aren't really experts. Yet Dr Huang observes that artists such as da VInci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as eletronic code.

Wouldn't it be awesome if a computer could read your emotions? Like what if you smiled every time you saw something that you liked, and the computer decided to give you more things simliar to that. Or if you decide you don't like it by scowling or frowning it changes it to something completely different. If these advances were possible it could make learning in school possible to understand if you are struggling. By that I mean you could be getting frustrated with a problem, the computer reads your expression, and suddenly it is giving you an easier version of that same topic you are going over.

I think that these softwares actually could be valuablle for the students in the classroom. If the computures could read our expression and help us by

automatically changing the lesson to a slightly easier version is very helpful. This can show teachers how well a student is progressing in school by the way the computer is understanding the individual itself. So if it is possible for this kind of technology to happen it would be very successful in most learning industries.

This kind of technology can be helpful to some of those who struggle. Sometimes teachers can't just focus on helping one individual at a time every single day when they obviously have other students to attend to. If the computer read every kids facial expression then it could help show the teacher is a student is struggling or not. ",4,7,0.7974386215209961
a13393c,"I think the Facial Coding System is valuable in a classroom. I think this because It can help out a lot. When a student doesn't want to explain thier emotions or don't know how to share emotions this system can be helpful and valuable. And I mean it is pretty cool that a facial system can calculate anyones emotions. And this FACS sounds totally unharmless.

In the article it explains how this system works. I will be wrtiting about how it works and get examples from the article. In the article it says that an action unit can calculate movement of one or more msucles and can detect the emotion. Dr. Paul, the creater of FACS states that he has calssified 6 different emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness all with the FACS. Examples of how the FACS can detect your emotion is in your face movements for example, as said in the story when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow when you are surprised; your orbicularis oris tightens your lips when you are angry. It is fantastic how this can know the emotion you are feeling.

I think FACS can actually be valuable in classrooms. A teacher can detect weither a student is happy,sad,angry, or surprised. It can be very useful for students that when they want to talk to thier teachers but don't know how to explain themelves this can help. FACS can help out in many more ways, useful ways. So my statement is this technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and I also think students would enjoy trying it out.",2,7,0.8544208407402039
a145382,"I think this artical is important. Our emotions are always changing. This new technology can help us in different ways. I'm for this because learn how someone feels is important in some cases. Facial experssions show how someone feels through their emotions.

The creator of FACS is an psychologists named Dr. Paul Eckman. The Facial Action Coding System is able to read an identify peoples emotion. Only the six basics which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust ,fear , and sadness. The way they found Mona Lisa's emotions was by using a 3-D computer to construct the face. They found all forty-four major muscles, the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit on the computer.

If the FCAS was used in school it can be a benifit to students and teachers. It can show how student are acting in class to see if they're under standing or not. If someone isn't understanding then the teacher can see and talk more on that subject. If the students id doing an assinment on the computer and get the answer wrong and see confusion the system could reword the question and see if that's easier.

The main idea of the Facial Action Coding System is to see emoition. It can help in many situations. In school we can now see if student are confused or paying attention.",2,7,0.9040491580963135
a169df3,"Facial Action Coding at schools?

Class rooms with , Facial Action Coding , ? I think for a classroom with Facial Action Coding would not be such a good idea in a classroom. There are many reasons why it's not a good idea. There are many emotions in a student in a class room that a student wouldn't want to be recogize . For many student there always someone who is in love and does not want anyone to figure it out . In paragrahp 3 it tells readers that "" happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" can all be shown with the Facial Action Coding System. The student might be sad because the girl wouldn't go out on a date with him and show that emotion in class.

For many students I honstley think alot of students would not like it . Another reason why it would not be a good idea to put this new Facial Action Coding System in many classroom is it might distract many of the students. Alot of classroom students are already going through alot of things like stressing, grades, finals, and credits. They wouldn't want that to be pick up by the system for a example a student could be really sad about his grades and doen't want anyone to know. Our minds are only safe place to go where anyone can't go.

Other places would be a better option for the Facial Action Coding like hostiptals and nursing homes. A good reason why I think it would be a good idea at a hostpital because it can help alot of people that are sick and feeling pain. In paragraph 3 it say the system can pick up happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. At a hostpital a patient could be help out with the machine and tell if she or he is sad or happy. At a nursing home he can help out the the old folks by making sure that there not depressed or angry.

What if the Facial Action Cding system shows that 50% percent of the student show that they really get the work. And the other 50% percent do not get the work what would the teacher do? Would the teacher choice be right to choose to get the same work where the 50% percent doesn't understand it and give the same work to the other 50% percent of the class that already knows how to solve the work. I think it not a good idea for classrooms to have Facial Action Coding System at schools.

At schools it might not be a good idea and might be better in many other places. For many students it coulld distract them or if other dont want to show emotions because of there personal thoughts being shown to teachers. Would you want schools to have this new Facial Action Coding System at there school and on computers?            ",4,7,0.7841740846633911

While others think that this new technology is a bad idea, others think it is a good idea. The text states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This proves that this technology could help students with their school work if they did not understand it.

The article states, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-- for video games and for video surgery."" This proves that this technology can make people happier by just making others smile.

The Facial Action Coding System should be allowed in school and other public places. It would help people understand what everyone else is feeling and if they need someone to comfort them. The new technology should be allowed to make others around them happier then they were earlier.

What I say is that the technology that we us today is not always what we need in life to find out about a simple smile where we can just feel and see it with our own eyes.

a2082ba,"Childhood is often painted as a happy, idyllic time in our lives, but in reality, it's a precarious era of high emotions and crucial development. One of the best places to demonstrate the vast range of emotions a child or adolescent experiences is the classroom. Triumph, frustration, bitterness, and indifference are all commonplace feelings at school, and analyzing and understanding these are crucial to creating a better system of raising and educating children. That is why the Facial Action Coding System would be a fascinating, tremendously beneficial experiment that would revolutionize psychology.

The Facial Action Coding System is a new software, designed by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois, that constructs a 3-D computer model of the face and analyzes the movement of the muscles to indicate emotion: for instance, when you smile and raise your eyebrows, you might be 50% happy, 30% surprised, 12% sad, 5% afraid, and so on. There are six basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise.

If we are capable of calculating human emotions through facial muscles, then we ought to use that power and knowledge to better ourselves. Let us attempt to understand our children, in order to judge and improve the education system.

For instance, a child might be surprised or angry when they do not understand a concept. Through the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher could more accurately guess which of her students grasp a concept and which do not. Additionally, reading emotions would aid educators in finding the best method of teaching for children of types, enabling more to become successful. This would lead a massive decrease in standardized testing and other measures of measuring how far along a pupil is in their studies. The Facial Action Coding System would not only enlighten teachers, but would save the government and schools precious time and money.

Furthermore, school life almost always overlaps into private life. Two students who are dating or are friends will continue their relationships outside of the classroom. Conversely, troubles and victories at home frequently bleed into their school work. If a child is having a rough home life or experiencing personal loss, they might not be as focused on the quality of their schoolwork, or, in extreme caes, act out. Teachers cannot be the sole support system for students, but they do have a responsibility to ensure a child's physical and emotional welfare, whether it means settling petty disputes or recommending therapy. Imagine the multiple lives that could be improved if the signs of unhappiness could be detected and addressed. On a darker note, the Facial Action Coding System would be most expedient in diagnosing depression, mental illness, and the tell-tale feelings that too many youths suffer from before thoughts or attempts of suicide.

Finally, utilizing such a powerful tool in the classroom would revolutionize child psychology. New branches of study could be devoted just to scrutinzing the way a face shows feeling. Experts could see how certain elements and events in life affect a child. A greater empathy would form, shortening the widening gap between generations, especially in this epoch filled with technology and new ideas, and allowing humanity to unite. A more focused, diverse view on society can be discovered through a child's eyes; we can improve our society, piece by piece. And all this can start with the Facial Action Coding System.

There are those who feel that subjecting children to these trials is an invasion of their privacy and imical to their natural development. It is true that a child should not be exposed to an excessive amount of software, and it is a valid complaint that invading their mind can be harmful. However, with responsible adults, the Facial Action Coding System can pick up on the children's discomfort and address their issues, from whatever cause, with more honesty and empathy. The Facial Action Coding System is a victory for psychology, and when used right and in moderation, it will benefit all parties.

The Facial Action Coding System will revise psychology. It detects the six basic emotions conveyed in the muscles of a human face, paving the way for an increase in enlightenment in our society's perception of childhood and coming-of-age. The Facial Action Coding System will assist teachers in determining their students' progress, help them grapple with their unfamiliar, often frightening emotions, and create a fresh look at child psychology. Despite the expense and the risk that scientifically calculating a child's feelings will hurt them, it is at least worth a try to see what a student can feel in a classroom and start making improvements in education and understanding humanity from there.",6,7,0.8535386919975281
a23fdd9,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students in a classroom to read. This new technology can tell many emotions that humans may show through their facial expressions. These emotions may include happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It is an advantage for humans to have technology can detect the six basic emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System is able to ""identify mixed emotions"" (Nick D'Alto) meaning that the system can figure out more than one emotion at a time. This technology is valuable because not many humans can detect more than one emotion at once. The majority of the time a person can only tell if a person is satisfied or not. An average human can not detect six emotions an a time like a calculator.

In addition to this the Facial Action Coding Sysytem calculates a human's facial expression similar to a calculator. The technology used determines the subject's emotions by using percents, by using math to show the amount of possibly the subject's sadness or anger.""She's 83 perecent happy, 9 perecent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" (Nick D'Alto). It is safe to say that no regular human being can caculate another human's emotions using math in this way. That is why the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students to read, and know about.

This new technology is so impresssive that it can also detect when a person may become uninterested in what they are doing. ""Could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (Nick D'Alto). This new tech system reads whether or not a person is engaged into what they are doing. Isn't that magnificent?

Critics may say that in fact it is not magnificent or even impresssive. The facial Action Coding Sysytem is so advanced in its self that ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (Nick D'Alto). Thus indicating that regular computers similar to the ones available at schools are not capable of calculating facial expressions similar to the ones being shown, by Mona Lisa. The author Nick D'Alto, also states that ""computers need to understand that, too"". Meaning that is would not hurt to upgrade the PC people are using, to use the coding system.

It is valuable for students to learn about the Facial Action Coding System. This sysytem was used to calculate the emotions of Mona Lisa, one of the most iconic art pieces created by Leonardo da Vinci.The subject in that painting did not show one particular emotion right away, because the subjects face was so copmplex. Mona Lisa's face was so complex they had to use an advances system to determine the subject's emoptions. Thus indicating why this new technology is valuable for students to read.

If a student is at school and they are watching a video online where a person is trying to describe something or inform them of something and they are confused and the computer notices it, it could show them to another website that could help them understand it better. It could also inform a teacher that a student needs help. Another reason this would be a good idea is if a student isnt having a good day and they are upset and the computer recognizes it, then the computer could transfer them to a page that could cheer them up and put a smile on there face, which could help them get through the school day. It could also send a signal to a teacher that could lead to help from them. Another reason i suggest this tool is if a student gets very upset about something and the computer notices it, then it could help a teacher get a councelor if the student is having problems at home or with other people in the classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System could also come to help for students who might be suffering from depression and no one noticed the computer could help.

Therefore, the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable and should be allowed to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System is able to read six basic emotions. These emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" explains how this new technology works. It states, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

In addition to, the text also states that, ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrow when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" Therefore, the technology is able to read basic emotions humans have.

In a classroom, however, using the technology will be very helpful. For example, people are able to tell what another person is feeling due to the facial expressions seen on their face. However, people are able to lie about how they really feel, including students. The technology is able to sense when someone is confused. According to Dr. Huang, in the article he states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Therefore, if a student is feeling confused, the teacher will be able to be sure that the child is confused and be able to aid the student.

The technology can even be able to help students if they don't understand a certain lesson. According to Dr. Huang, after he informed that the technology is able to read when a student is feeling confused or bored, he says, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Every student learns differently and understand things in different way. Some students may not like how their instructor teaches and will need to seek help someway. The technology will be able to assist the student the way the student wishes to be assisted.

Students could really use this valuable tecnhology to aid them to success. Whether the student is bored or confused, students can count on technology to support them.

By using the Facial Action Coding System, teachers and students would be able to explain questions and problems to each other, as well as how to make learning a more suitable experience for everyone in the classroom. This includes having simpler homework questions or practicing questions by using computer games or programs.

The use of the advanced software could even go far beyond the classroom and into after school activities. By using the FACS software, it could hep students get more involved in after school activities or help them improve on a specific skill for that activity. In paragraph nine, the text discusses how drama coach Constatin Stanislavsky uses the Facial Action Coding Sytem helps improve his actors emotions on stage.

Drifting off and on is something children learn early in their childhood due to the endless work on the computers that is supposed to help them read, spell, do math, and a ton more. This is a tough problem everyday people deal with, whether it is at work, school, or even at home doing some type of training. Thankfully, there is now a solution to all of that falling asleep nonsense. Solving this problem can help a large amount of people, that is why there is an intelligent new technology everybody should take advantage of.

The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto talks about a new edition to computers that can read your emotions called FACS. FACS stands for (Facial Action Coding System). This software was invented by a scientist named Thomas Huang, also known as Dr. Huang. The article even explains how the process comes about, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" (D'Alto 3). The text is explaining that there is a coding inside of the computer of a face with no emotion! The face mirrors you and calculates the muscles in your face to tell your emotions!

Say goodbye to falling asleep at your computer! One of the best reasons for this coding software is to help students to not fall asleep in school at the computer. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Says Dr. Huang. This is important because most students find themselves drifting off during an article or a big test. They get done reading the text and don't remember what they read because of the tiring school work they set out to do. The article says, ""' Then it could motify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. 'Most human communication is nonverble, including emotional communication.' notes Dr. Huang."" (D'Alto 6). In other words, motifying the lesson can help to make the assignment more interactive and hooking to the student.

Using FACS can improve your childs grades, learning environment, and the confidence they have about their school work. FACS will help people all over the world have more productive days.",3,7,0.7530992031097412

The software was created by Prof. Thomas Huang. The software can identify 6 emotions. It can tell if you're happy, surprised, angry, disqusted, fear, or even sad. The software has a video imagery that can trsck your facial movements by identifying a type of emotion.

This type of technology can read art from thousands of years ago. It could even help theatre students practice their facial expression for plays. This software shows creativity of this invention. This software can also help psychologists by showing the true result of their patient's emotion and diagnosing them correctly. This software program can do wonders for big technology in this world.

The software identifys each of every emotion by sudden movement in the face area. For example tightening your lips could identify anger. Or for another example raising your eyebrows can be identifyed as a surprised emotion. This program matches with your characteristic movments of the facial muscles allowing the program to identify a sort of emotion. Any movement of the face can trigger any set of those 6 basic expressions. ",2,7,0.8562179207801819
a3127af,"Have you ever gotten one of those moments where you think, ""how did they read my emotions?"" Now imagine that with a computer. We can use computer technology to detect emotions of someone. It could even help in detecting depression.

The Facial Action Coding System can detect multiple emotions at once. The author even considers that ""Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code""(Paragraph 5). The scientists that work with FACS demonstrated with the Mona Lisa, with the intention to see what she was feeling like. Computers should have this technology because most communication between humans is nonverbal, in realtionship with emotional communication.

While your PC at home can't handle the complexity of this expirement that was used to decode the Mona Lisa's smile, it is still possible to find emotions. ""But we can write down son simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions (paragraph 7).

You may not always need this type of technology, but with increasing cases of depression, it could be possible to detect early stages of depression before it is too late.

Some experts are able to see when people lie on television. Actors for example, are caught lying by professionals because of the certain muscles that would have been used by that actor. The experts are able to figure out if that muscle they are using is making a fake emotion or not. But not everyone is an expert in this type of facial reading. Which is why we should have technology in classrooms detecting student emotions. During a lesson in a class or something, expressions cold be read to figure out if they aren't paying attention because they are laughing, if they feel mad about something, or if they just don't care. The technology could even detect when something is putting on a fake smile during class.

I stand with the people who believe that we should use FACS to read students emotinal expressions. It could help detect depression in students, it could help with finding out what the students could be confused about; and it could also be used to see what students may be distracted on something else. Putting on a fake smile may not always work, but putting on a real one will make you feel happier.   ",3,7,0.7981632947921753
a332bce,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" by Nick D'Alto, describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. There is a paragraph where it can detect students facial action, and the value of using this technology to read students' emotional experessions is something I can agree with.

In the passage, the article states that a classroom computer could recognize a stuudent becoming confused or bored (Dr. Huang). After that, it could modify the lesson similar to what an effective human instructor could do. My response is that a classroom computer that has FACS(Facial Action Coding System) can help the students lessons and making them understand easier. For example, if the FACS detects the student being confused while doing work on his laptop, the laptop can try to make the lesson more understanding in a level the student is in.

Advertisments can help students feel interested on what's on the ad. I'm a student and ads appear in my laptop. Most ads I'm not interested in and I intend to skip the ad. There are new ads appearing everyday on a students phone or on their laptop. The passage states that if you smile when a web ad appears, a similar ad might follow. If you frown, the next ad will be different. If a student is depressed and is watching a video, the FACS will detect his emotions. The FACS will insert an ad on his or her screen that can have a chance to make the students' depression lower down or be forgotten about it depending on the ad. If an ad pops up and the student is interested in it, he could focus on the ad and won't focus to much on depression.

There is an amount of students who play video games at home afterschool. Most are on their laptops or PC's instead of console. I believe that games can cause violence. Students can have fun with a game on their pc, but later on that emotion can change into something else. It could change into anger. The FACS can help that. If they read a student having a different attitude that's unecessary, it could make the laptop shutdown for the student to take time calming down. In the passage, the FACS could work for video games or video surgery. Another thing, the FACS can remind the student to do their work first before playing on their laptop, just like what the mother would to their child.

Finally, I believe the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions can help help them be more educated by helping on their lessons, emotions, and control. Computers need to understand that, too (Dr. Huang). ",4,7,0.8366649746894836
a337cff,"Nick D'Alto wrote this passage in the mindset of informing us how this new technology works with analyzing and even producing seemingly accurate emotionsal information theough a computer analyzing the muscles in individuals faces. Prof. Thomas Huang is primarily the man who produces or made this program for a computer. They used this to determine the emotions of the magnificant work of the great artist ""Leonardo da Vinci"", called the ""Mona Lisa"".

They claim that it can produce the same or even better results for many different jobs than people can today.

They say that they can set up a computer that can do a teachers job, in the classroom. They say that it would be able to read students facial expressions and emotions and determine if the students are confused, bored or even any other emotion. Then it can reteach the lesson in a different or more simple way than the previuos way. The people also say ""most human communication is non verbal, including the emotional communication"". Therefore, it would make this computer even more relevant. They also say that using this could improve many digital subjects such as video games or video surgery to make the faces more expressive.

The prefessors have a reasonable argument for their program and they might be on to something. If this computer/program can aid teachers in teaching their classes, this computer would be the perfect fit for further the kids learning experiance. Therefore, it would be a great aid to the teahcers for them to get to better teach the students if the teachers themselves dont pick up the students confusion or frestration.",3,7,0.8634331822395325
a354d9b,"Often times within a classroom setting, it is easy to become bored or confused. One second of being off track can lead to being completely lost for an entire 90 minute class. While most teachers do their best to keep students engaged and learning, often times it can be impossible to keep tabs on the emotions of 25 people at once. However, Facial Action Coding System can track the emotions of all students. Introducing the Facial Action Coding System would be incredibly helpful within a classroom setting.

The Facial Action Coding System would be able to ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This skill would be incredibly useful, as sometimes it can be hard to pick up on exactly what someone is feeling within an efficient time frame. Sometimes while teaching, it is difficult to focus on students emotions and the lesson all at the same time. However, the Facial Action Coding System would take over the task of recognizing emotion, thus allowing the teacher to focus on the lesson at hand. According to Dr. Huang, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". Being able to see all of these nonverbal queues would help teachers to see the level of engagement that each of their lessons creates, as well as help students that aren't engaged.

The Facial Action Coding System would additionally allow for the computer to ""modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This modification would allow for students who are bored and not engaged to better understand the lesson at hand. This would likely increase the learning that occurs within the classroom, as more students would have access to a lesson that made sense to them. Additionally, this eliminates the guess work of a teacher trying to come up with an effective lesson. The computer can do it for them. Thus, time can be used more efficiently when teaching students.

The Facial Action Coding System would also give a practical application for anatomy and coding within the classroom. This application uses a ""3-D computer model of the face"", which must contain ""all 44 major muscle groups"". Some complex subjects taught within schools are often seen to have no practical application. However, the implementation of the Facial Action Coding System would show students that the complex skills of coding and anatomy can come together to form something that they see everyday. The use of such an interesting implement as the scanning can help students to develop newfound interests within these fields. This can serve as an excellent teaching point for students looking into the fields of anatomy and coding.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would have significant benefits on both the faculty and students of a school. It would help to make the teacher's job easier and more effective while enabling the student to learn better. This system would create a lasting impact on the learning done by students.         ",5,7,0.8218414187431335
a367429,"I belive that the Facial Action Coding system reading is very accurate and can be used in the classoom might help. Theres many ways that if the teacher is aware she/he can might can help out that student. Theres a saying that states ""you cannot read a persons mind"" which is true but you can sense there emotions by the look on their face sometimes . The Facial Action Coding can help you read fully what this person is feeling.

For examples The Facail Coding System can tell if you're faking your smile to keep from showing how you really feel teachers wouldnt know how you feel unless you tell them whats going on with you. Using the coding system can tell the teacher your emtions that way they can deal with it and move forward in your learning. Not only just a happy and sad emotion the system can consist but when the teacher is teaching the lesson she can tell if the students get in by the expression on their face the sensor can tell weather or not the student is fustrated or confused on what the he/she is teaching. The teacher can get a percentage of the students emotions about the lesson if teacher gets the results and they show simlar patterns of confusion among the she can revist the lesson . In paragraph 6 it states when the compture predicts how the student is feeling it can ""modify the lesson "" I believe that it'll help the student learn the lesson like everybody else is in their own way because everybody has different levels of learning

In conclusion I believe that ther Facail dectection can be very helpful in the classroom setting. It can help teachers learn and create lesson for everybody to get a better understanding in what they are teaching. The analaysis can also help everybody to come more aware and understand facial expression.   ",3,7,0.8293476700782776

or the Facial Action Coding System is going to be helpful

to the students in a classroom because they would start to feel the true depth of the picture of the person and how they really felt or if they were hiding something and didn't want anyone to know about.

In the text it states that we humans perfom this same calculations everyday with the peers that we are mostly around suck as co-workers friends and family. We can tell how one of our friends feel simply by the look of there face, but for other people it may not be as easy. This computer can be helpful in the classroom and scan the students to see if they are scared confused or bored that can help modify the lesson that the student is getting and help the instructor or teacher understand where they get confused on. This system can aslo be fooled by actors that make themselves imitate the emotional feelings like being happy or sad which can mess with the system and confuse it and the system can be wrong and tell you the wrong thing.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding system can be a major break through when coming to solving the real emotions coming from the pictures that you can't really tell what the felling are or what the picture actually represents. It can also reveal so much about the human body and how it can reveal the real science of emotions",3,7,0.8698244094848633
a3a4c11,"A new technology, called the Facial Action Coding System, has been developed by Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois and Professor Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. This software can analyze a face and determine which emotions are displayed. It creates a map of the face from either a picture or scan and then determines which muscles and regions of the face are contracted. This information is then used to determine the exact percentages of emotion in the face. While this technology is incredible and definitely will have various areas of use, the classroom is not one of these areas as there are already more efficient and more cost-effective methods to determine a student's comprehension of a topic.

In schools today, this facial recognition and emotional analysis is already in use. As the author of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto, states, ""[...] humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day"" (D'Alto 5). While teachers teach lessons or assist an individual student, they can observe the student's face and can determine how the student is reacting to the material. A machine is not required to do this action, and it would cost much more than a teacher who can already perform the same task and teach the lesson accordingly.

Perhaps if both the teaching and facial analysis was done by a computer, then using this technology in online classrooms may be worthwhile. Dr. Huang predicts that ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' [...] 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" (D'Alto 6). The problem with this solution is that there are already websites such as Khan Academy that teach the student and analyze their performance without the need for invasive methods such as constantly recording the student's face. Khan Academy simply asks students questions as it teaches or gives interactive activities that record the performance and help them see what they currently comprehend and what they need to review more. This method already functions very well and is personalized, therefore bringing in a new and more invasive performance analysis method into online learning is not necessary at all.

As if the previous two points were not enough, this new technology requires more computing power than your average household or school computer has. As D'Alto explains, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (D'Alto 7). The implemenation of this software would require heavy upgrades to processing power in every computer that would be running it which would be incredibly expensive. Many schools and households do not have the money for this kind of large-scale upgrade to their computers. Moreover, this would be an expense with little benefit because everything this software is capable of can already be performed better, cheaper, and more efficiently by teachers and websites.

While this new software certainly is impressive, it simply is not necessary in the classroom. Human teachers can already analyze their students' emotions and interact with them directly, and existing learning websites such as Khan Academy analyize performance with questions and activities without being invasive to the students' privacy. Neither of these methods use the high processing power required to use this technology, and neither come with the significant cost of upgrades and other implementation fees. All in all, this innovation has no place in the classroom at this current time.",4,7,0.8905117511749268

a431cea,"Like Da Vinci he could tell what Mona Lisa emotions were just by studying her face.thats why new software was made to see what peoples acuall emotions are .thats why there so many industries has this.

In the artical the authior is talking about how they have a new system called the Facial Action Coding System, and it detects someones face expressions to see if there sad ,happy,etc . It has some kind of 3D effect to were they can detect the feelings that person has. Now like the Mona Lisa they can put that picture into to that computer system and acually see what see was feeling. Most people dont even use computers anymore because its a waste os time and resorce.

There for students can probably tell what their friend is feeling just buy the look on the face . Some probably dont even know how to do that so there probably going to use that FACS(facial action code system) to see what that person is acually feeling. Most people like Da Vinci study peoples faces to see what there feeling and to paint them . But in todays generation no ones uses that kind of ssytem they just look at someones face and tell what there feeling .Thats why the authior was talking about how studentscan just tell what there friend was feeling.

In the artical it talks about how you move your face a certan way to create emotion. Like say if your really tired , a muscle around your eye called Orbicularis Oculi Pars Palpabraeus will make something we know called crows-feet. Most time when someone is feeling sad or happy there muscles in there face will move if they want to be happy or sad. Not only does facial muscles expresses emotions they produce them . Like for an example some producers will make there celebirty make facial excersises .

All of this about new computer system and facial emoitons are all the same , just not done in the same way . Like if your scrolling on soilcal media and an Ad makes you smile thats still emotion. All its basically about is muscular action units in the face. But some people can be fake smiling to were you can tell because when you real smile the corners of your mouth will lift up call Zygomatic.

If we did that without permission it can lead to privaticy being broken and the students would probably feel uncomfortable. I also think we should use this because the passage says if a student looks bored or confused the Facial Coding can identifiy the problem and it can make the lesson eaiser for the student. The Facial Coding could also be useful because if a student is feeling depressed the machince can identify that and the student can get the help that he or she needs. We don't want students walking around school feeling that way because that can lead to decicions that a student wouldn't usually make if they were happy. Maybe we should get the Facial Coding System in our school systems.,2,7,0.7724665999412537

This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes. While the Facial Action Coding System detects facial expressions that indicate a person's emotion, the system built in a classroom computer is valuable to students, because it can manipulate the lesson based on how students are learning.

The ability to have a classroom computer that is able to read the emotional expressions of students, would be very valuable is a classroom, because it allows the lesson to be taught in a way that would benefit the students, according to Dr. Huang. In a normal classroom, teachers create lessons that confuse the students or do not appeal to their learning ability which creates a tension for the learning environment. With the use of this technology, classroom lessons would be more educational and responsive. This is because, the technology is able to recognize when a student is confused or bored by reading their emotional and facial expressions. This is useful since the system can alter a lesson plan to be suitable for the students in the classroom which would potentially help them learn better. For example, if a student is confused during class, it is likely that they will not ask for help, leading them to not understand what is going on in the lesson. Having this technology in the classroom, would sense this and modify the lesson so that a student would be able to learn better and understand the topics.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms would be beneficial in classrooms to both the students and the teacher, because it would allow the teacher to adjust lessons in order for more students to understand the concepts. Dr. Huang predicted that the system would be able to manipulate lessons based on the readings of emotional expressions in the classroom.

a482ee4,"The claim I will be making today is that I do not agree that the usage of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in a classroom. I do not think students will use this kind of technology unless they are leaning towards a certain career area. On a normal day at school you won't use this technology because we will be focused on more important things such as math,science, english, and foreign languages. In paragraph 1 it talks about how in the Mona Lisa pictiure she is 83% happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.

Yes the Facial Action Coding System can be useful but in the classof art, kids using the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is very unlikely to me. I think that students will not use this in everyday life. In a school that isn't an arts school does not need this kind of technology. In pargraph 4 the article says ""The facial expressions for each emtional are universal "" but I do not agree with that . You can put a smile on your face and the Facial Action Coding System will detect that you're happy because it's based on what your muscels are forming. In a classroom that kind of technology is not going to be used very often. In paragraph 5 it says "" you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face "" which is true. You don't need to go out of your way and take a picture or draw someone just to describe and give an exact percent of what they are feeling. Just ask them if they are okay and let them know you are there, you don't need to know exactly how they feel from a system of facial coding.

In conclusion I feel that this type of software will not be needed in the classroom because there is no use to it and it will not teach students many things such as our basic subjects do. Us students will not find the usage of this Facial Action Coding System useful unless we are in a certain career path.   ",3,7,0.827577531337738

Technology used to read emotional expressions would be very helpful in classrooms because it would help students progressively learn.

A piece of technology that detects students' emotions would assist students and teachers in and out of the classroom. Every student learns at a different pace.

a54cdd4,"The Facial Action Coding System, or better known as FACS, is a new technological advancement that can detect how a person is feeling. It holds promising applications for a variety of different things.

Prof. Thomas Huang collaborated with Prof. Nicu Sebe to innovate this technology. The Facial Action Coding System is a very complex.

It recognizes the muscles in the face and compares them to a neutral face; this is how the system can tell if you are feeling happy or sad. Eckman, the creator of FACS, organized six different emotions for the system to recognize. These feelings are, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and identifies muscles such as, the orbicularis oris, which tightens your lips to show anger. This action is very similar to what we as humans do every day, except this is much more accurate.

I am for this technology becuase I think that it could help our students fully understand the material better. Every student learns differently, and that can make lessons more challenging for some more than others. The Facial Action Coding System could potentially modify the lesson to make it easier. I also think that this type of technology is important for students that have trouble focusing. The system could potentially make the lesson more exciting; this would possibly help the student focus better. It could also help the world of animation. Dr. Huang predicts that it could make computer-animated faces more expressive; this would be helpful for video surgery.

a54dbd6,"Technology is always improving. From a simple toaster to a toaster that can make several pieces at once. This facial recognition is a new way of detecting the true emotions of someone. I think the use of this technology is useful to all students, parents, governement workers, and etc.

Facial expression does not have a set of rules you have to follow. For example, when someone is very angry, they might cry instead. In result, the computer might take it as sadness. Most of the time, facial expressions are easy to recognize. In paragraph 2 of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" it says, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (D'Alto 2). Everyone has different neutral faces. Most people have a good way of keeping in their emotions, making their face look blank.

When expressing emotions, certain muscles are tied to certain emotions. In paragraph 3 of the article, the author says, ""... your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you're surpised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"" (3). Most of the time when you are surprised, you raise your brows. Also, when you are mad, you make a face, and tighten your lips.

When in school, you can use your facial expressions to show how you are feeling. In paragraph 6, the author goes on to explain that, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huange predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Several teens do not speak up when they do not understand something that was taught during class because they do not want to be embarrassed. So if you are at home, on a computer, you will not have to speak up you can just act the same, and the computer will change it to help you understand more efficiantly.

In conclusion, facial recognition is a great way to get students on the right track in school. It can help the teachers decide if their teacher techniques are effective or not. Also, facial recognition can help people understand how others are feeling in certain pictures. If someone throws on a fake smile for a photo, the computer will recognize that.

The FACS( Facial Action Coding System) would be useless for students. Online schooling could use this software but students in a class room would make the software useless          ",3,7,0.7975305318832397
a5e1346,"Yes, Facial Action Coding System is great way to see how students feel, because not everyone shows there emotions. FACS is going to help many students when they show how they feel. For example, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" It will help to develop better ways for people and computers to communicate.

How FACS works it starts with a 3-D model of a persons face it will have 44 muscles in the model and they have to move like human muscles. FACS technology will show a persons emotions like happy, mad, surprised, angry, sad, and scared. It will know when you move a muscle, and it can detect what emotion the person is doing. For example, ""your frontalis lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"". This Technology is safe and will be very useful for many people.

In conclusion, FACS will develop more and it will help many students in school, home, and just in general. This technology will be very useful and very productive. Facial Action Coding System will develop better ways for people and computers to communicate.                                ",2,7,0.8575700521469116

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it talks about a computer program called FACS (Facial Action Code System) can detect how you are feeling. This could be valuable in classrooms because it can help students learn better and be in better moods through out the school day.

In class a lot of students do not care because they are bored or sleepy or in a bad mood. This new technology could help solve that problem for many students worldwide. In the article Dr. Huang says ""Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or a painted face..."". This quote explains how the computer system could help with students moods. It could also help teachers identify how students are feeling and how to go about approaching them and trying to solve the problem.

If this technology could be put in schools around the world it could lead to school being less frowned upon and become a more positive thing.

Students go to school to learn. But not all teachers teach in a way where all students can understand it. If this new technology could be put into schools there would be less failing students and more college graduates. In the article it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"". The tecnology in schools would be great for students. This could make it a lot easier for teachers as well.

a5eaac8,"The new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sysytem that enables computers to identitfy human emotions is a geat idea. I am all for the new technology. I plenty of reasons why.

One reason the new technology is a good idea is so you can tell wheather a child is bored or no in school. In the text it states,'' A classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr Huang predicts. Also in the text is states,'' The same technology can make a computer-animated faces more expressive for video games and video surgey.

Second reason the technology is a good idea is because the computer can can tell how your feeling one day and how your feeling the next day. In the text it states,'' The computer has six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Also in the text it states,'' For example , your frontails pars lateralis muscle ( above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when your suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. The technology system has diffrent emotions.

Finally a third reason why the technology is a good idea is because it helps produce your face expressions. In the text it states,'' According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emtion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. For example; coach Constantin stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.

a621e0c,"The technolology to scan your face and tell your emotions is kind of creepy. Having a machine in class to tell teachers how the students are feelling is just a little weird to me but it also could be very usefull. In the text it states that the software in the computer could see if you are confused and will change the lesson so the student will better understand.

The main reason why this is creepy to me is it reminds me of the Movie Tremator. In the movie Arnald Swartsnager comes back to the past to protect the future leader of the human rebelian aginst the superior robots they have built. Well to make a long story short the robot that Arnald Swartsnager plays can scan Robert Oconner's face and asked him why is your face leaking. Yes I know this technology is far more advanced than the movie ,but that is how I can relate.

I can also relate to how the computer could tell if you are confused and change the lesson so you can learn the way you do. In the text it states the computer can tell if you have a fake or forced smile or a guinine smile by the rincles under your eyes. The text also said you can probly tell what mood your friend is by the look on their face,but the person could be hiding their true emotions from you so the computer can tell if you are mad at that person at that time and place.

In the story the author includes how most video games and surgery cames have non verbal comunications,and how your home computer could never process this information like how your feeling that day.

I personaly would like to have this technology in our classrooms,and our homes. This would help out alot of men. For an example its your one year weading anaversery and you ask your lovley wife what she wants to eat. A simple question,but you rember that she can never tell you where she wants to eat. Or the example your kids come home acting odd you ask what is wrong but you dont get a responce. So you go in to there school computer and watch what mood he or she is in.

So I have told you my thoughts on the subject time to recap. I first thought it was odd and kinda scarry due to it reminding me of a movie and the robots. Then we relised that this technology can be great for the students who dont fo very well in school becaouse they do not get the lesson.",3,7,0.7277125120162964

Details from the article of the use of Facial Action Coding System to read the emothional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable becaues it helps us understand emotions, it helps us see true emotions, and it helps us connect with emotions.

My frist support is that it helps us understand. According to the article it can detake mixed emotions. For example the new emotion-recognition software trackes these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. It can also indcated where it is a gerneral smile or a fake smile.

My second support is we can see true emotions. The article staes that in a false smile the mouth is streacted sideways using the zygomatic major. In a real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. So it proves that this tecnonlgy can indicate the differnce between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My last support is that we can connect with emotions. The facial Feedback Theory of Emotion says that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. An example is a drama couch has his students smile and frown to produce those emotions on stage and really feel them.

Details for the article of the use of this techonolgy to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable becaues it helps us understand emotions, it helps us see true emotions, and it helps us connect with them.

The article states that this system allows computers to identify human emotions. The six basic emotions include: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In my opinion, i think this use of technology would be extremely valuable for reading students emotions inside a classroom.

This technology can detect emotions of people that not everyone will be able to point out on someone. In paragraph five lines 6-8, the author states that Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. Dr. Huang has a similar software that has similar values. If this software was used in a classroom, it would be able to detect precise emotions of students, whether they are confused or understanding something.

In many schools, students often use computers. In paragraph six, it goes into detail of what it would be like for this system to be put into use. If the Facial Action Coding System were to be put on students computers, it would be able to help get a better understanding of were the students are at. For example, if this system shows that the student is bored, this can tell the teacher that they need to make the assignment more hands on or active. Another example would be in the student is conveying the emotion of confusion. This can show the teacher that this particular student needs more help and a better understanding of the topic. If the student is showing the emotion suprised, it could show the teacher that the student learned something new or is interested in the topic.

In paragraph eight, it describes what a false smile looks like. The article states that in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and the muscle risorius. Later on in the article, it says how these movements are able to detect whether someone is being honest or not. In a school or classroom, this can help take on more of a disobedience act then being able to detect if someone is confused or not. If a student is not in the right state of mind, whether that be depression, anger, etc., this new technology can help the school figure out a way to reach out to the student and recieve them help or guidance.

The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" goes into depth of ways the new technology, Facial Action Coding System, can be valuable in detecting human emotions. At the beginning of the article, the author starts off by giving an example of this technology being used on the Mona Lisa painting. The author gives the percentages with each of her emotions she is conveying in her portrait. The author then states this technology is able to detect the six basic emotions: happines, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. By putting this into classrooms, this can help the teachers, administraters, principles, etc., get a better undertsanding of their students and the environemt they work in on a day to day basis.",4,7,0.9386992454528809

a6bcef5,"I do not think that the technology to read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom is valuable because the coast is proably astronomical, how people feel inside is personal information, and it might not even be completely correct.

Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that is still in trial and error. You can not use the program on just any computer which means you have to buy special software to be able to use it. Not only would you have to buy the software to use it you would also have to buy the computer program, and because its still not completely finished you would be buying something that could crash which means you're pouring your money into something that might not even function properly.

Your emotions are personal and sometimes you dont want everyone to know how you feel. With the Facial Action Coding System you would be able to know how everyone feels. That seems like an invasion of space and unfair to those who do not want their business out in the open for everyone to know. if schools did end up having this program i think there should be rules and guidelines to prevent invasion of privacy like you can only test picture of peoples faces who consent.

There is no solid proof that the Facial Action Coding System is always correct. in the passage they never said wether or not they had a testing trial to prove the acuracy of this program. If the passage provided information on how they tested it on people and the results came back correct that would make it more desirable, but there isnt anything in the passage that shows that we can trust this software program.

I do not believe that this program would be valuable for students in a classroom, the price is more then likely out of budget and there is no proof that this program is even reliable. The program doesnt seem like it would help with very many subjects in school and there is still no proof of it working. ",4,7,0.8016706109046936
a6fe2a9,"Wouldn't it be nice if we could know the percentage of each emotion a person is feeling? With this new software called the Facial Action Coding System, that is now extremely possible. The use of this techonology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classrom is indeed valuable because it can help sutdents express empathy, help them improve in class, and overall help teachers understand emotions when they cannot fully reognize them.

There have been a plethora of conversations regarding empathy and how important it is, and the Facial Action Coding System causes empathy when we can clearly see what emotion a person is feeling. According to the article, ""empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"", so with this new techonology, we can improve the way we read other's emotions, and this can trigger a sense of emapthy within us to know exactly what emotion they are feeling. For students in a classroom this is beneficial because a teacher can understand the ranges of emotion their student is feeling, as well as help the students recognize the emotions of their fellow classmates. With this innovative technology, empathy could be something far easier to produce.

Along with producing empathy, the Facial Action Coding System can even aid students in ther performance in the classroom, because according to Dr. Huang, the technology can ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and this helps because ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" which can immensely help the student to become more engaged because the lesson becomes more interesting. Dr. Huang also notes that ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"", and this is significant because a student may not voluntarily express that they are disinterested in a lesson, but the computer could recognize that anyways, and it is important for it to read the nonverbal communication the student reveals. Therefore, techonology can rapidly increase the performance of students by reading their emotions and engaging them into the lesson.

As well as improving the performance of students, this technology can improve the relationship between a teacher and student, becuase it benefits the teacher to know a student's emotion when they cannot fully recognize them. As an example, the article states, ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" although, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."", which shows that us humans have trouble actually matching a facial expression to an emotion. Although, with the Facial Action Coding System, this ""computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"", which is significant because this code works to portray specific emotions. so we humans can better understand them. Therefore, in a classroom setting, this is important because with the technology, it allows teachers to be aware of what their student is feeling, creating a stronger student-teacher relationship.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System would build a better relationship between students and teachers in a classroom setting, help students improve in the class, and produce empathy with both students and teachers. Nonverbal and emotional communication is incredibly important in human interaction, so this technology can help explain emotional responses, ""even when they are trying to hide their emotions"". A software that ""improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others"" could potentially be greatly beneficial to students in a classroom, because of its complex ability to help humans express emotion better, which also helps the communication between computer and human.

a70540c,"facial action coding system. you may ask what is that? well its a new computer system that can detect emotional expressions of students. some may ask how it works and other might be like that sounds stupid. well this system like in paragraph 3 stats it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face and detects your emotion.

This software could be really good in the stat to read what peoples emotions are in the since of having someone as a prisioner and they wont speak. another good thing about this would be if someone cant speak because of an illness so you could us this to see emotions.

there is also a bad side in using this software. in paragraph 3 ""44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". so if one of your muscles is not in the right spot while this software is running whos to say it wont work, or won't be able to detect what you are expressing. another bad thing about this software is in paragraph 5 it stats ""in fact, humans preform this same inpressive""calculation"" everyday. for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there face"". well like the passage says, if humans can already tell how someone is expressing on there face by looking at them, the really why would we need to use this program to find that out for us. also in paragraph 6 ""for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow"". well thats great that it will be a more interasting ad but ads have been around for a very long time, and everyone would just have to say, they would just rather have no ads. so this program might make the ads more interesting to your need but no ad out there is going to keep someone intertaned for the full 30 seconds. another disadvantage is at the top of paragraph 7 "" your pc can't handle the complex algorithums used to decode"". like this sentence is saying the software might not even be able to recconized what you are expressing because it may not be prgrammed into the software or might not have ever seen you make that expression.

therefore, the facial action coding system is not really the best thing to use to find out the expression someone is giving you. reasons being, humans can already figure out the expressions, and it might not detect what you are expressing. for these reason the facial action system should not be used to find out expressions.",4,7,0.8502040505409241
a738aaa,"In the atricle ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the outhor describes about how a new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions. I rather not be scanned by a computer to tell me my emotions. I don't think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable.

The first reason that I think we shouldn't have computer scanning are face because we need privacy . I wouldn't want a computer scanning me to see if I was happy, sad, tired, or mad. Example of the computer testing someone "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Also there's no need to know there emotions some people don't want you to.

Second reason is that I wouldn't want to pay for it. Some students couldn't afford it. Others could buy it but why would they they are at school to learn not know other peoples emotions. Example what the emotion scanner would do "" if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similarad might follow. But if you frowm next ad will be I different."" This shows me that you don't need it because all it shows your emotions anwhat kinds ads other sruff that could help you. There's no point for this if it nots helping you with school activities.

Third reason is whats the point of having this. It does benefit a liitle bit by changing stuff the computer to change our mood. Example of this ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" But rather than that it doesn't help us. It doesn't help us get good grades, doesn't show us what to do in class, and doesn't help your teachers eitheir.

So in this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" where they other talks about compter showing your emotions isn't valubale to any school.

a7caf1d,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", author Nick D'Alto informs readers on a new type of facial-analyzing technolgy. This software is known as Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. Dr. Paul Eckman, a well-known psychologist, created the program based off of human expressions. Six basic emotions (joy, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, and disgust) can be identified through the movement of 44 major facial muscles. Specific muscles move parts of the face, and can be associated correspondingly with emotions. The software was practiced on the ""Mona Lisa"", a famous Leonardo da Vinvi painting. The woman displayed in the artwork was revealed to be, ""...83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry (D'Alto 1)"".

The technological advancements made with this software is being introduced to educators, such as Prof. Thomas Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science, located within the University of Illinois, as well as Prof. Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. These teachers have been given the opportunity to take a look at the system, using it to, ""develop[ing] better ways for humans and computers to communicate (D'Alto 1)"" . Because of the software's introduction to educators, many may wonder if this kind of technology could be brought into college, high-school, or even elementary classes. Is this ethical, or should emotions be valued personally, rather than publicly?

There will be and already is a ruckus of controversy over the extensive (and still growing) use of technology in schools. Tech has multiple benefits, which many schools choose to see. The benefits of technological advancements tend to outweigh the negatives, which is why so many schools are seen introducing technology as early as preschool. Current students, grades pre-k-12, will grow up with and eventually work in some way with modern technology. Understanding how to use it is an necessary skill to have. However, the use of a facial recognition technology is more of an ethical question than a necessity-based one.

The FACS system could be used to detect signs of unnatural emotions in students, such as prolonged anger or sadness. It may be able to, as it advanced, prevent emergency situations for students, especially those in high-school. These situations include abuse, suicide, threats to general student safety, and similar situations that should not be taken lightly. This program may not only be beneficial to teachers, but students as well. An understanding of a how a student is feeling may lead to the discovery of an unfortunate situation, or the case of a student in need of help, yet not sure how to ask for it. Currently, depression is found in 1 of 5 teens, and 2 out of 3 of those cases go undiagnosed. Teen suicide rates are rising, especially in females of high-school age. If there is a system that can prevent lives from being lost, a trial run may not be the worst idea.

Overall, the introduction of a FACS system into classrooms woudl serve as more beneficial than negative, and may assist with emergency instances for both teachers and students. This system is extremely valuable to the quality and worth of saving or improving a life. With consent, the software can take the information it collects in order to further update the modern technology we use and share all over the world. The program not only has the potential of bettering the lives of people, but may continue to bridge the gap between human and technological connection, capability, and understanding.",4,7,0.8130748867988586

With new software it can recongize Mona Lisa emotions. Which can actually calculate emotions of others.

An by now, knowing that we have new techonlogy like 3-D printers they can give Mona Lisa emotions.

The computer can construt a 3-D modle with all 44 muscles that must be moved like human muscles. The creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is by Dr. Paul Eckman. Which Computers can give the a certain look or emotion. The software stores similar anatomical information called electronic code. But only speacil computers can make people have emotions and faical features, not our normal PC at home.

The way people express their feelings and emotions, can show everyone how you feel about certain things. People who will try to hid their emotions are very fond of themselves for not expressing it.    ",1,7,0.7907662987709045
a8621aa,"In Nick D'Alto's article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" he talks about a new technology called the Facial Coding System that enables computers to identify all kinds of human's emotions. This could be a very valuable tool for classrooms, but it also sounds scary that computers are consuming more and more of students' time. In some ways the technology to read a student's emotion can be very helpful, but there are also many cons to the technology, which should make so it should not be used outside of the classroom.

The Facial Acting Coding System is and will be helpful in the future to students' learning. While a student is using the computer it can tell if they are learning and concentrating or bored and tired. Also, if a student seems intrigued by a certain assingment or video, the computer can see that and produce more that are like it. Lastly, if a student is struggling, but he does not want to admit it the computer can see that and communicate with the teacher of the classroom.

Even though the computer is helpful, there are many possible problems. First of all, just like the article said, humans can already tell when other humans are happy, surprised, angry, discusted, scared, or sad. If we can already read human's emotions why do we need a computer to look at one another to read their emotions? Just by simply looking at a friend we can tell if they are having a good day or if they are struggling. We have lived without this technology for many years so why do we need it now? It seems like humans are only wasting their time trying to create new technology like this for example.

Students and their parents alike should fear these computers. If parents want time with their kids, and if they want to help with their kids emotions these computers will ruin the parent's chances. The Facial Action Coding System is helpful now, but in the future it may take away from family time, and the students might go to their computers for help instead of their parents. This system could create a disaster in the world if people do not go about it the right way. Finally, with these computers humans would not be able to hide any of their emotions. Some emotions are meant to be inside and stay that way. Not everyone needs to know all your deep dark secrets. Especially a computer system does not need to know your secrets.

The Facial Action Coding System could be used in many different ways. If the technology is not used right then the world could be changed for the worse, although if it is used only in the classroom (the right way) then it could be very helpful to students who struggle. Overall there are pros of the system, but we need to be cautious with the new technology and make sure that it is used in only beneficial ways. ",4,7,0.9256033301353455
a8a46d4,"In my perspective, I beleive that when viewing someone's facial, or human emotions it should be visual. I do not agree with the form of technology. By viewing someon's emotions it forms a sense of character which is good with person to person to person with associating with one another. According to the article, it talks about how the process with technology starts at a 3-D computer of the face which is then known to have 44 muscles which then shows the movement of the face to detect the human's emotions. The article continally explains that the facial expressions are what are known to detect the emotions through technology. This ll today is showing you what all a computer can actually do. According to the article they agree on using the technology from what the computer can actually do. In my perspective I think my opinion is the opposite. Your emotions should be detected by another human;s point of view, not by technology. ",2,7,0.7856777310371399

I say this because it's more natural to use your own mind instead of having to with a computer. This is my opinion of this article, because it makes you have to use your mind instead of having a computer to use it for you.

Students should use their minds when it comes to this, because you will be able to tell other people moods and yours also. In the text it states,"" The facial expression for each emotion are universal."" What this means is that the facial expressions we use are used all over the world. So why not learn them your self instead of having a computer to do it for you. When you travel there will be facial expressions every where so it's best if you learn them on your own so you will understand what there moods are.

When you can tell people's mood from their facial expression and you address it to the person they might think your smart. In the text it states,"" Moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This is also another good reason to read facial expressions, because it benefits you in a mentally way by reading people's body language. Another way it can benefit you is because it shows your actaully paying attention to the person's emotions.

When you use an computer to read people emotions just imagine doing it non verbally and using your mind to read it. In the text it states,"" In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" For an example if your friend is looking down or happy you will most likely be able to tell from their facial expressions. I say this because us as humans we use facial expressions everyday so why not be able to read them.

As you read this passage this can be a life lesson, because it's used in everyday life. As we get older and years pass we will always use facial expression so it's best to learn them instead of a computer doing it for you.

One reason why I think the FACS is a good thing is because it would be great for the cosulasr at the school that could help ceritain kids out if they are feeling low, depressed, sad and any other negitive feelings. a sentence from paragraph 3 says ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear , and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscels.""

Another reason why i think FACS is a good thing for studenst in the class room is it could read the studnce and if the student is having trouble or confused , the FACS could see it and make the assiment less difficult for the student wich would help alot, I thought this because in the text it says , "" A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confusd or bored, Dr. Hang predicts.

a948dbe,"The Facial Action Coding System is a great idea for students to use. With technology advancing so much it is essential for the school assignments to advance along with it. This technology is the next step for students and teachers alike. The FACS should read the facial expressions of students because it could keep students engaged, and addresses whether or not they understand the subject.

The FACS is able to keep the student from getting bored. While working on the computer for so long a student can easily get bored and tune out the lesson. The FACS though, can use its technology to make the content more engaging; like making ""computer animated faces more expressive"" (D'Alto). By making faces and other aspects of the lesson more interesting students have a higher chance of keeping their interest in the lesson. This is just one example of how useful the Facial Action Coding System could be for the students outside of class.

The FACS also would tell when the student is struggling or is confused with the material. Normally in a class setting a student can ask a teacher for help, but it is not that simple on the computer. Instead of the student continuing to not understand the work the system ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto). This way the student can be sure to get the correct information and not miss out on anything from lack of understanding. This is another reason as to why the FACS would be a great tool for the learners.

To close, the FACS is the right step for helping students. Not only does it keep them interested in the lesson, but also helps when the student is confused. This technology can be beneficial to students and teachers because of all of the usefull features that it offers.

Well the whole process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of all faces; all 44 major musals in the model must move like human muscels. Movement of one or more muscels is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, Creator of FACS. Eckman has classifed six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles .Here is a example in the article 1. Raise your lips at the corner of your mouth.

2. Than Squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the corner of your eyes.

3 Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes.

According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emoton, moving your facial muscels not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

This machine found out that she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This software is the latest innovation from Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. This software actually calculates peoples emotions like a math homework. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"".

Dr. Huang observes that facial expression for each emotions are universal even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting he different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece.

In fact, we human perform this same impressive calculation everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried and so on. Yet Dr huang obsereves that artists such as Da vinvi studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anaomical information as electronic code.

I think this machine could be very useful in different situations like in offices, classrooms and even in personal homes. I would like it in classroom because it could tell whether students have a problem with something. I think this software could be a great thing for a classroom.

But if you frown, the next ad will be something different.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student s becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify a lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. I think if a computer is able to do this it will make boring or less interesting classes more interactive, fun and understandable which makes students more willing to learn and will understands things better.

But new technology has been created to predict a subjects emotion state based on muscle position. Acording to this creation, the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Does this creation (the Facial Coding System) work? Could it be benifitial? I believe using this technology to read students' emotional expressions could be very benifitial because it could read peoples emotion status, it could detect threats, and it could be used to force information

I believe it is benifitial because it can read emotional states. For example, students in a classroom. Say one student could be happy and another could be tired, but theres that one student who is frightened and needs help and wont ask for it. With this new software the teacher could recognize the students failure to understand and help. In the article it says, ""if you smile when a webcam appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This text evidence suggests that the software can calculate ""dislike"" and ""like"" emotions and correct them if needed.

I believe it is benifitial because it could detect possible threats. For example, fight in a classroom. In the classroom keeping student under control is a big must in a public school, but with the new software it can pick up any form of anger and will notify the teacher right away. Students are prone to violence because they do not know right from wrong and it can be very dangerous without proper control. In the text it says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" What this means is that the new software could calculate a precise 3-D image and determine someone's emotional state.

I believe its is benifitial because it can be used to forcefully remove information. For example, student who cheat in class. During test it can be hard sometime to catch student who cheats, and when you confront them they refuse and say they didn't. With the new technology and software it can detect any fear or another emotions to prove if they cheated or not. In the text is says, "" 'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly)."" This means that even though each smile, frown, or other muscle movement is universal and can be detected by the software.

In conclusion, the software can be very useful. Time will continue to grow our technology and soon we wont have to worry about guessing peoples emotions. So students can be unpredictable when it comes to behaving and learning, but with the new software it can predict almost about anything about the student.

The Facial Action Coding System is a new software from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe that can recognize human emotions. This invention was tested on Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa portrait. According to the software, Ms Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. While the Facial Action Coding Systemmay seem like a high-tech toy, it could have some really important affects to help our schools. Having Prof. Huang's emotion detectors in classrooms would benefit the learning and success rates of students around the world.

The Facial Action Coding System could detect boredom in the classoom. When kids are bored in a classroom, they tend to tune out whatever lesson is being taught and then struggle to try to figure it out later. Boredom has a devastating consequences on today's students such as low test scores and poor grades. Prof. Huang predicts the Facial Action Coding System will help with this issue, saying ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Teachers being able to see how their students are feeling would give them more insight to create lesson plans to engage all students and bring up test grades and overall GPA rates.

The Facial Action Coding System isnt only useful in grade school through high school, it would also be beneficial in colleges and post-degree programs. The emotion detector would be very useful in the law enforcement schooling and in Med School. In the law enforcement, professiosnals are often called to do interrogations and questionings of suspects and witnesses. The Facial Action Coding System could work hand in hand with lie detectors to make sure interrogators could get the full truth out of suspects. This would also help in their schooling by training future cops to be able to read key facal expressions for different feelings. According to Prof. Huang, ""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication"", making this resourse vital for cop trainees to fully understand how to properly get information out of suspects. In Med School, this softare could immensly help future surgeons in their practice. Prof. Huang said, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" This could teach our future surgeons the different muscles of the face for possible surgical procegures and teach them how to read their patients emotions. Having this knowledge could help doctors find out how uncomfortable patients are pain wise and even how to properly help patients. Doctors need to have good communication skills to make sure their patients is proprly cared for and having the Facial Action Codng System in Med School would greatly help surgeons in their training.

aa95fab,"Imagine a world where emotional reading is performed by robots, and raw human emotion is simply binary code. This could be a reality if the classroom is converted into such a world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable, due to the lack of the software's ability to decipher verbal emotion, the ability of humans to naturally perform the same techniques as the software, and the cost effectiveness of this kind of software within a classroom setting.

The first reason why the use of the FACS within the classroom would not be valuable is due to the inability of the software to understand verbal emotion. When a student is confused and or emotional about a topic, often they will express this through verbal communication. The FACS is not able to register this kind of emotion, at least not this early in it's development. As cited in paragraph six of the article, "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers will need to understand that, too.' "" This statement also brings about the issue of emotional expression not on the face, including body language and stature. These reasons defend the idea that FACS is not a valuable software for the classroom.

FACS also is not valuable because it is not diverse enough in its usage nor its abilities. Teachers and peers can easily spot emotions just as easily, and often more accurately, than this machine. As cited in paragraph five of the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day."" This would lead this invention's discovery to be unneeded and unneccesary, unless in it's applications of the distinguishment of the emotions of century old art pieces.

The software itself would not be cost effective, with the extravagance of it's research. As cited in paragraph one, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam."" This two Professers are of very renowned within the hierarchy of education, and the software itself is a product of the two researchers. This would lead one to believe that the software would not be cost-effective, especially within a state-funded school district.

To synthesize, the Facial Action Coding System would not be a valuable tool within the classroom because it lacks the ability to de-code other sensory based emotional expressions, can be replaced by humans, and is far too expesive. Although the software is useful, it is not practical nor diverse enough to be used within the classroom. If the FACS could be more efficient, especially with it's purpose, it might be a candidate for a positve addition to the classroom, but presently, it serves no new purpose.",5,7,0.8380734920501709
aa9c596,"In this article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"", this article tells us about how many emotions we have and how to identify them. In futuristic terms their has been a new software created to identify human emotion by just scanning facial expressions. The software is called FACD ( Facial Action Coding System) and from the paragraph it seems that it has various promising applications and for different industries. In my own opinion, I do believe that this technology is very valuable in so many different ways.

The reason why I suppport the claim of this technology being valuable is because, we can detect when something is wrong with a child or anyone for that matter. As it states in paragraph 1 "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"".

This software has a remarkable way of just identifying your emotions and putting it into percentages.

So say if a child is depressed this software can give us the information we need to see what we can do to help a child, teen, or even an adult fight depression. This software can help us identify with mental sicknesses.

In paragraph 5 it summarizes how we can identify our friends expressions by the look they have on their face. Later on in that paragraph it tells us a doctor named Huang observes the remarkable artist Da Vinci and how he used human anatomy to help paint Mona Lisa's face. Even Da Vinci had a code to use to determine the emotions of people. The point is if we use this type of technology we can help a lot of peole around the world to identify with them, to have empathy, and mostly to help them.

Another reason why having this software as a valuable assist is because, if we unlock the science of emotion who knows what type of treatments we can do to help people who face anxeity, ddepression, suicidal thoughts, etc. Their are so many possiblities to just an expression. We can figure out what's wrong with them?, why are they this way?, and maybe we can figure how long they've been that way ? This tool doesn't just need to be used in schools, this tool can be used in the hospitals, therapists offices, etc. I just believe we use this technology we can change the world and make it will little bit better.

In Conclusion, This technology helps us in many different ways. Like for example how many emotions we're feeling and rate them from greatest to least We could discover new emotions we've never even heard . Also we could give people therapy if they have anger issues, we can treat people who doesn't even know what's wrong. This technology can do many things and solve many issues emotionally.

aaf980b,"To think that scientists have been able to program a computer to tell what emotion someone is feeling at that moment is pretty amazing. It would take a lot of thinking and considering to then finally be able to tell a computer when a person has this or is showing that, that they would be showing that certain emotion. However, part of me thinks its not all it is said to be.

Many people these days are very good at hiding their emotions and feelings. They may seem all happy and joyful to someone but on the inside they could really be hurting. Or it may be the other way around. They could act very sad, but actually just be trying to trick someone. If you were to put a computer up to someone like that, I just do not think it would be smart enough to detect that. Think about actors. They are one of the best people to hide true emotions. They are the ones that have to fake being happy or sad or mad or in disbelief. They can trick anyone into thinking that. On the inside though, we do not really know what it is they are feeling. In the passage it says that the computer detects the certain way the muscles in your cheeks are. It also is the way your eyebrows are. If your eyebrows are raised, this can show surprise. When your lips are tightened this can show anger. The computer has to be able to tie all of these things together. What if the person is showing all of these signs and it is their certain way of showing that one emotion. Everyone has their own way of showing each and evey emotion. For example, if a person is angry they do not always tighten there lips or lower their eyebrows. They could keep their eyebrows and lips the same but still be angry. For me, I just do no think that these computers are going to be as accurate as what you may think. Sure, it is most likely going to get a lot of peoples emotions but not everyone. It is talking about bringing it into classrooms to test people in a class emotions. It is going to be the same as doing it on the street. Not everyone is going to show their true emotion and the computer is not going to detect each and everyone of them either.

So for this new technology that these scientists have discovered, I think it could work and I think it could fail. It all depends on how smart the computer is going to be or if it is just too smart. For many I hope it works, but I guess we are jsut going to have to wait and see. ",3,7,0.7768057584762573

So they came up with a way and got her a smile for the photo and now she is smileing thanks to the computer program. We would think that she would just smile but she would not have it and so they had to give her a fake smile.

So this story is them talking about how they made this program. When they put the smile on it was perfect. Mona lisa smile was not the greatest but could of fit the bill. Leonardo da vinci did not want her smile so they made a program and copywrited her smile and made it fake. Like they said ""she was 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry.""

The computers softwear that was created by thomas huang created the computer that can see peoples reactions to things. Her emotion was very inportant to leonardo da vinci her emotion was the part of the art because without the computer then she would be missing on things on her face. As in the mouth and her chin,nose and cheeks part of her cheeks. Like they said she was a little upset and they did not know how to get her is good mood so thomas huang created the computer that can notic emotion like as in sadness,anger,happy,nervisness,fear,disguest. All of the emotions every single one there are more emotions. So that means anybody gets there hands on this device then they can find out how anybody is felling. This device could mean the end of every thing.",1,7,0.6120846271514893
ab0ec19,"Would I want technology to read students emotional expressions,no cause I would'nt want people in my head knowing how i feel that's ain't nobody problem to know how i feel. TO me that's weird that technology can do that.

Why would they want that,some people like to be by they self when they in they feelings.

In paragraph 1it say that at least according to some new software that can recognize emotions.

But it can help to tho cause how about if somebody sick but they dont know thats how we can know if that persin sick, just thinking. How do it work what they do ti find out the emotions of the person, do they put plugs on they face.

How do Dr. Huang know that he can do this ,like how he know this wont hurt nobody doing this. so by weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions.

In paragraph Dr Huang observes that artistssuch as Dda Vinci stidied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. He got a new computer software stores similar anatomical ibfornation as electronic code so they both are working on the same thing.   ",2,7,0.820325493812561
ab12904,"Isn't interesting when your computer can detect your exact facial expression without telling it what expression you're making? Image going to school or out somewhere with that kind of technology and detecting what expressions or feelings your friends or family are having. Dr. Huang and his colleagues have figured out a way to do that with the Facial Action Coding System.

The Facial Action Coding System is a computer that contructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Using the 44 different muscle joints that a normal human face could make. The Facial Action Coding System can classify six different emotions such as happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. When a new emotion is shown then it associates itself with the different muscle characteristics. Then, by weighting the different units of the face, the software can detect mixed emotions. Mixed emotions are when you are feeling two or more emotions at once. Making it more challenging for anyone to figure out how someone is feeling.

This kind of technology makes it easier to figure out how people are feeling, and it would help humans understand the situation more if the knew what kind of emotions were going on. The value of how far technology has gone is going to change society for the better good. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) could go to schools, organizations, busnisess, and etc.. For example, if the new technology went to schoold nationwide then the teachers could detect whether a student or some students are confused or unhappy about the lesson they are teaching, and then the teacher can look at the system and find a way to improve his/her lesson so every student can understand what is going and maybe even enjoy the lesson. By doing that schools could increase there graduation percentage and more students could succeed in school, and less people would drop out and actually finish their education to get the kind of future that they need or want.

Another example of how valuable this new technology would be is in a business organization. For instance sales are something you have to show alot of emotions in so the sales person can persuade the consumer to buy what they want them to buy. By using the new technology it can help the new salesman out by giving him pointers on how to improve his/her speech that they are giving the consumer to make it sound better or maybe even more reasurring to the buyer. Therefore, it will make the sales person more money, fullfill their job and keep their job longer. I mean, that could happen in any kind of business, it's a promising application for any industry in the making.

In conclusion, this new software can be helpful in many ways, not just for scientist to create and use in their experiments, it could help the whole entire nation and even help the economy or even politcs. There are so many new opportunities and open doors with something like that to help generations after generations. The value of this software is priceless. Each facial expression and emotion are universal, so why wouldn't you want some small computer to help figure those out for you. ",4,7,0.8342804312705994
ab31560,"I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it helps us to define how exactly you are feeling. According to the passage it says ""In a real face or in the painted face of Mona Liza. The software can identify mixed emotions"". This technology was made by Prof. Thomas Huang, ""an expert at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"" as said in the passage.

In my opinion i think Prof. Thomas Huang did a great job on making this project for humans and computers to communicate. Lets say if your happy, you smile to the computer this ad will pop-up and they will add another one to keep you smiling and if the next ad frowns you they will do their best to keep you smiling. The project is called Facial Action Coding System, which can detected your expression Human vs technology.

The computer detected

The Mona Liza expression, she intended to bring a smile to your face.

ab490fb,"What do I think about the Facial Action Coding System? I think the Facial Action Coding System is a great step in upgrading our tecnology but I just don't think I could see myself ever using it. I don't think it is necessary to have because some people might not want others to know how their feeling that day. In the passage it is saying that you are able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide it, which I think is invasion of someone else's privacy. I just think that someone else's emotions and how they are feeling is for them to know and them only. I think that this innovtion could hurt many people because if someone had a family member pass away and this computer is saying they are 99 percent sad and if someone were to ask them they could get angry or put them in a worse mood than before. I also think this new innovation could work out in our prison systems to help us understand if a murder really does feel remorse for the family or if they are saying it to get the less severe punishment. I also think it would work great in couple theropy or even any group theropy to see if them talking to a counceler is helping them or making it worse.

The Facial Action Coding System could be used as a new and improved lie detector test but only through emotions as said by the author of this passage, ""to an expert, faces dont lie."" I also think the Facial Action Coding System could work out really great in a classroom because I know from personal experience that when something is hard or challenging then you wish for the assignment to get easier and with the Facial Action Coding System you could do that without a teacher even being there.Another reason I dont think it would be the best idea is because staring at a computer screen all day everyday would eventually hurt your eyes or maybe even worse. That is why I think the Facial Action Coding System could be good and could be bad for the people.",3,7,0.7116678953170776
ab8f0aa,"Facial Action Coding System, a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Personally, I think that sounds like a good, well-built, successful invention. There are a lot of technologies and experiments that haven't worked in the past, but I think this could actually get the researchers somewhere. Technology seems to be increasing everyday and I feel like the new Facial Action Coding System is a good step to make and push forward for the future. The process is starting with a 3-D computer to make a model of a face.

That includes all fourty-four major muscles in the model must move just like you see on a real, living human. Without the muscle movement features, people would not be able to tell how this creature persay, is actually feeling emotionally or physically. The fact that the professers, and scientist are putting that much thought and detail into this object, is mind boggling. The author then explains in paragraph six, that the Mona Lisa demonstration is actually intended to make the people looking at it, smile. It also shows how much the computers can do and make. While looking at this newly invented object, it should make you think about how it was all created and how it all came to be.

Personally, I feel like this new invention called Facial Action Coding System could make a good impact on the kids in the future. Most people nowadays love technology and know how it all works. I feel like it's a good invention and could impact not just humans, but also the world. More jobs, careers, and opportunities will take charge with this new object at hand. I think it could become something new, helpful, and entertaining.        ",2,7,0.7751048803329468
abc1902,"This story talks about your facial emotions like Dr. Huang observed. He observed that the artisit such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enought to convey specific emotions. It helps them because if you're feeling sad you might go to the art muesum and see a picture that has a happy family and they can put a smile on your face. Another thing is that there is a muscle called Orbicularis Oculi Parrs Palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes if you didn't know about that. But also, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce. Also, in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle called The Risorius. But to an expert, faces don't lie, these muscles clues are somtimes used tto spot a ""smiling"" politician or celbrity isn't being truthful. For example if you're feeling sad and your friend tells a funny joke you can fake a smile your friends won't even relize your faking a smile. Also a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, he had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowing (what a great way to practice) as a way of creating these emotions on stage and i think that's a really great way to practice because if they go up on stage and don't know how to do a really great emotion their drama teacher might get angry. In conclusion i think have a drama teacher teaching you how to do an emotion right and having computers to tell if your happy or sad or angry is a good thing to have in the world.",2,7,0.689298152923584

Yes I do think it's valuable but at the same time I dont agree with it because theres such a thing called privcy and I dont with anyone wants to be read like a book because if the world sees us all as the same no one would be special. At the same time no one can tell you how your feeling beside ourself and I don't think a computer could tell the full story. I know thats not all the feelings in mona Lisa's face, there ahs to be more to it, there always is. Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists but what if they are wrong? We don't know for sure, we just relie on people who tell us what we want to believe and we have no choice but to believe them.

abd24bc,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a technological facial recognition system that tells about a persons emotion from their smile. Here are some points to talk about when thinking of this topic.

If your'e really truly invested in using the FACS system you could very well be doing yourself good and bad, here are some reasoning. Let's start with the pros, first off it would be a pretty good technological advancement if we could get the facial recognition to work for us. Second, if it does work we can use it to tell how people are feeling if they come into work school or home and they do not seem like they have had a good. The FACS would be a pretty amazing system to have and use in the future, whether it be the near or far future. Now with the cons, first and foremost the program could completely bomb and not even work at all and just say a random amount of percentages for your facial expression. Second of all, is there going to be a cost? will it be free? The passage is saying that they would have it in school, so would the computers the children were using already have it embedded into the software? This is a hard thing toputout there for everyone to have access to.

There are so many questions needing to be asked and answered about this program, and this will be a hard but ground breaking system. This FACS system could possibly be one of the best inventions known to man. Let's hope it would be a real true thing and nothing fake.",2,7,0.7673876285552979
abd3595,"I think that using the techonogy to read student emotional expression of student in a class is valuable because it help to see if a student is happy/mad/sad .Like in the passage it's talking about how they are using this new technology call ''The Facial Action coding system ''Which mean -a system enables computers to identify human emotions . They are aslo using the 3-D computer model of the face ,As they can aslo calculate the emotions . As because you can see what is wrong with your friend/family .

One reason why I think it's valuable for technology to read your emontional expressoion on studnets is by the promgram ''Facial Action Coding System'' why because just by using a video as it sates in the passage 4 ''using video imagery the new eemotion recognition software tracks these facial movements ''they can see what kind of emontion you have and for them to help you out I am guessing or at less it can be valube for making them feel better .Also because is the system is what emotions that person has it can let other people know and just to keep an eye on them .I feel like it will work on other person as well it will help me out because sometimes my mom/daad get a serious face and I don't know if they are happy or sad .

It aslo can be valuable for student's in school because in that way you can help them out to feel better or sometines you just don't know wehn that person is feeling happy or sad as it states in the passage 5 ''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face '' and the new technology can help you read their emotions the way they are feeling .Another reason why it can help on students with the new technolongy by the imagine as it states in passage 6 and just by the imagine the computer will know when you are happy or sad .This can help us by helping them out and for them not to feel that way becasue sometimes when student's get mad they do thing they know should't do but all that sadness or anger can take them over by casuing harm .As it will be nice to stop the harm from someone doing it. Another example is this Wed ad as stated in the passage 6 as well now this wed can see your other emotions as an example .''If you smile when a wed ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow .But if you frown the next ad will be different .''A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored '' As Dr. Hiangs predicts then he could modity thr lesson because they want the student's to pay attion in the classroom for them to learn and not make the class boring or for student to get lost and never asking question but as that to then the teacher will know what makes them get bored and what makes them get fouces . This will help for many toher student in school by not causing hram if they mad and aslo by helping student not get bored or lose fouces .

Now on my personal life I will say that the technolngy will help me by seeing how are people feeling when I see them walking around with there face down or just seeing them happy .Like for example lets say that I am walking around the hall way and see my freind wih a serious face or just them not talking to I will like to use the technolgy and see what is wrong with them and try to help them out with the feeling they have and just try to change their mood .Another reason why I will like to help is by seeing how does my mom feel when she looks at me like just take a picture of her and see what are the emotion she has or as in passage say in 7 an ''encode ''different emotions like make her look at her self in the mirror and follow the steps it say and see what are the emotion she has. But yes the technology ''The Facial expressio for each emotion are universal ''because it can help out in many awlays

As you see I do valuable the technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a class because it can help in many way to see the way they are feeling in there emotion and in there way of learing .Just like Dr. Huang he doesnt want his student to lose fouces and doesnt want them to feel sad either .Just like it will help in school for the student's .Also as using the 3-D computer mood just by seeing an imagine it can see what kind of feeling you are having . As yes it will be value to use later in ;life well it will help me with my friends and even my own kids and students at schools .    ",3,7,0.8696563839912415
ac16db3,"The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D' Alto is quite an interesting article. As it talks about how technology can detect one's true emotions. At the first glance, this article looked redicilous to me, How can a machine show one's true emotions but as I read more and more the disgust started becoming interest. And, now I am just fasinated by thid article.

In paragraph 1, the author states ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". Which shows how much technology has grown, now the technology can even tell us how and how much of a specific thing we are feeling. Quite amazing, is it not? One can't specifically say that the machine is 100 percent correct but in future maybe the technology goes even beyond this.

When reading this article, one may have had a few question about all this calculating emotions but in paragraph 2 many of the question that comes to ones mind are stated ""Hold on! Can we actually 'calculate' emotions---like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle fcial movements we humans use to express how we feel"". After stating these questions the author gave us their answers and not just left us curious. Recognizing one's feelings correctly is quite hard for even an human eye since someone may be trying to hide their true emotions, it's not as impossible as it sounds now due to the technology which is a good thing about the improvement in it.

In the article the authior states a couple benefits of having technology that can detect your actually feelings, one of them is in paragraph 6 "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. huang predicts. 'Then it could modify lesson, like an effective human instructor"" This one particular benefit of having something that can calculate your expressions, quite got to me. It can help so many students and teachers as it can lesson the burden on teacher to go to the specific person and help them understand and the student also would not have to wait for a turn.

Dr. Huang follows up that statement by saying ""So computers need to uderstand that, too."" Why have a computer learn these human traits when people can just interact face to face.

People make their own decsions and learn from what they did right or wrong. The computers dont need to tell people to put a happy face on or show epathy.

This information could help stop many bad situations caused by emotional distress in the classroom.

Facial Action Coding System is ver valuable in the classroom. This software could help you know when a student is angry or sad. This information could help a teacher find new ways to better teach a student. With just the slightest knowledge of how a student feels in a classroom could help a teacher find ways to cheer up the student and find ways of teaching that better fit the student.

The Facial Action Coding Software could help stop situations in the classroom. This software could easily tell the treacher when a student is feeling extra sad or angrier than usual. This information could help the teacher get the student emotional help such as a therapist, counselor, or medical help. For example, in the cases of school shootings, 90% of the time the reason these incidents happen is because in the classrooms people don't recognize how a student is feeling and that student doesn't get help. With this software it keeps people aware of others' emotions in the classroom. This could make it easier to get the student help and ultiately stop the possible outcome. In situations where fights break out, it is often because the teacher doesn't recognize a students anger and can't effectively calm the students down in time and prevent the fight. With the Facial Action Coding System a teacher would be able to see when a student is angry or a bad situation is about to happen and the teacher could quickly make sure the situation is avoided.

Read peoples emotions without the persons consent might make them feel quite vulnerable or uncomfortable. Dr, Eckman has only classified six basic emotions. Happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness were the six emotions. I think that are more than just six basic emotions that need to be taken into consideration. I do agree when Dr. Haung said, ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" Caculating the extent of someones real emotion or expression is very difficult for trained professionals to actually get how a person might be feeling, so how can a computer know? I think just by measuring the persons muscles on their face it can just be a fake smile just looking like a real smile. Using this technology in different locations and settings could be very helpful. If the prodect accuratly can measure exactly how a person might be feeling. They could use it in law inforcment to caculate sadness, happiness, being suprised, or being nervous.

When scientests and computer programers combine it can be a beautiful thing. Scientests are developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate. With new encoding and development of software scientests have now created a way for a computer to tell how someone is feeling by using their facial muscles. The new programing will be a positive thing, muscles in the face just act naturally, the encoding is complex, and the new technology could be coming to local classrooms.

The Scientests have a whole process. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and has all 44 major muscles that must move like human muscles (D'Alto 3). All of the muscle units that work together as one is called an ""action unit."" Since all facial emotions are universal the technology could go worldwide once improved. The software could also identify mixed emotions. The technology reads how major muscles move and show emotion. With each emotion that is showed they compare it to a neutral face. Every day humans do the same thing. Humans read the face of other humans to try and tell how they are feeling. If they are sad or happy. There are six major emotions within the technology right now, there maybe more encoded at a later date.

With the new technology comes new computers. A home PC could not take the proper encoding right now. The scientests are working on something much better to try and get the home PC's to where they can encode them. The scientests new computer software stores similar anatomical information as an electric code (D'Alto 5). Although the home PC couldn't handle the encoding, they can give simple encoding to your home PC. The encdoing that can be given is simple instructions for differnent emotions. The simple encoding would not be able to read mixed emotions.

The emotional facial reading could be coming to a local schools. The new technology would be able to tell if a student was bored, or if they got confused. Then the computer could modify the lesson for the student to help them learn better. The technology could act like an effective human instructor. Must human communication is nonverbal. Emotional communication is also nonverbal. The studesnts could improve with one on one lesson plans. The studensts could also work at their own pace and have their own personal plans.

All the technology needs to understand how to read and comunicate with a human through facial features. The anatomy of a human is complex and hard to understand and encode into computers. The new programing will be a positive thing, muscles in the face just act naturally, the encoding is complex, and the new technology could be coming to local classrooms.

One example on how classrooms should be using facial recognition especially with students, can be shown on paragraph #7 whenever the author mentions that home computers can't always rely on facial recongiton, but that school computers can and should. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. But we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions."" As this paragraph is shown to readers, the author is trying to mention a point that home computers can be slow, and may not recognize faces easily, and that right there can lead to stalkers, and hacking occuring as well. Not only that but school computers can get hacked too, but with facial recogonition, they can stop that from happening.

Another example on how classrooms should use facial expressions especially with students is displayed fully in paragraph #5 when the author states that quote the ""calculation"" to recognize faces is so complex now that you can recognize everyone's face on a computer no matter if you mention there name. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look at her face."" This shows us the readers that we can identify peoples faces, on either a computer, or in person. It can be very useful for counslers because they can identify who this person, or people are walking into there offices.

Finally, the last example on how classrooms should use computer facial recognition especially with students, can be traced to paragraph #9 they claim that quote ""(Putting on a happy face"" actually works!) this shows us the readers that whenever the computers try to recognize your face, they can also see how you were feeling, whether it was happy, sad, or even emotion. And pictures can be a good recource to identify a cas, or in the case a student.

In conclusion these examples I showed were good whenever it came down to finding out what students are in where, but it can help not only in a classroom, but aslo in the world of law enforcement, and our phones. But if you use it incorrectly, you may have serious trouble in your hands.   ",4,7,0.830796480178833

In the text it states that

At least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The software is the latest innovation from prof. THOMAS HUANG, of the beckman institute for advanced science at the university of Illinois, working in collaboration with prof. NICU SEBE of the university of amsterdam. Dr. HUANG and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The MONA LISA demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it showa just how much this computer can do. Imagne a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.     ",1,7,0.8299421668052673

Author Nick D'Alto wrote an article called,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" which is about computers that can read emotions, thats crazy! Nick talks about how computers can spit out precents of feelings like in paragraph one he sated,""She’s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Thats a computer scaning the Mona Lisa picture created by Leonardo da Vinci. NIck stated,""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" So, these computers use musclkes in your face to figure out the emotions you are felling. So, how is this helpful to students in a classroom? Well, Nick gives an example by stating from Dr.Huang from Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,” Dr. Huang predicts. “Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.” Not only would it see if a student is bored or confused but the computer would help make the lesson more interseting to the student.

The big downfall of all of this would be prices, such as video games because, the computer would help better tell a story line and have the player thinking how the character feel ( let them feel more in the game). The article stated,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive—for video games or video surgery."" But, other than that these computer can be very valuable to humans in the future and example more about humans emothions towards school, eachother, etc. Not the mention teenage boys can be excited and if they are in the middle of class on youtube or something, how would that be stopped so the student doesnt get embrassed.

Wrapping all of this up, computer are used on a daily schulde whether its at home or school, computer could help slove depression by putting students into a great mood, help humans on tests or problems in life. Computers do alot of things for us and this could be a big step into sloving problems and emotions people are feeling.       ",3,7,0.8672040700912476
adbad2a,"Put this in perspective: a technology that could depict human emotion. Luckily, Dr. Huang of the University of Illinois has created this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. He used this new technology to depict the emotions of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The uses of this technology are endless, but one specific use could be in the classroom.

The use of this technology in the classroom has potential to be very valuable. For instance, if a teacer is teaching and a student is confused or bored, there is a way to teach that specific student in another way that may benefit him or her. Depicting these emotions would be done by way of computer. There would be a classroom computer and when it picked up confusion or boredom, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The technology benefits the teacher and the students.

One special use of this technology is how it can modify the lessons being taught by teachers. People are all different and learn in a variety of ways. Some people are visual learners and some people can learn just by listening. The technology can use the different models of teaching to benefit each student.

Because of Dr. Huang, the Facial Action Coding System could be used in places all over the world but in particular, the classroom. His technology can change the way of teaching and create more opportuinities for students to learn. Also, the modifications of teaching students can be done to fit each student and how they learn. Students and teachers will have access to a whole new environment for learning that will benefit their education. This technology will be able to depict students' emotions of confusion and boredom, change the way of teaching, and create lasting impacts on the education of students.    ",4,7,0.8770797848701477

Computers might know what your emotions and help in a couple ways to know if you're confused about something or do not like something you see on the internet. Just because you look at someones face, it doesn't mean that they feel some type of way. Someone could be smiling or laughing but that doesn't mean that they are truely happy. It's the same thing by having a serious face.

A face expression doesn't always show someone's emotions. Other people do not care about other people's emotions. It's better to notice things with your own eyes than a computer or machine to tell you how somebody is ""feeling"". The article says you can tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. That's true because you know that person very well.

People do want to hide their emotions for their own specific reason. We all have that moment when we would want to keep our feelings to ourselves. We wouldn't like for systems to know our emotions.",2,7,0.8071963787078857

In the article paragraph five the author says that we could identify each others expressions but we don't really know what each one means for example being happy, sad, or angry can have different looks and we might not know what they are. The author also states that with his computer he can tell what people are thinking if they are upset or excited, who knew that one expression could mean so many things. Sometimes the muscles are used to show if a politician or celebrity is telling the truth, it can also tell if someone is doing a genuine or forced smile. That is my opinion on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" and I think it would be amazing to have.",2,7,0.8249701261520386
ae0e8ef,"This technology to read the emotional expressions of studnets in a classroom is valuable because a computer can make your day better by showing you funny ads or just cherring you up. This technolgy is very useful becuase it can help you whenever your tired it can wake you up. When you smile about an ad the computer can show you a cooler ad. Also the computer can show faces toward you just to show you that it knows how you feel right now. How can you tell when sombody sad or happy or not this type of technogly can help us show how sad they is or how mad they is.

The Mona Lisa is an example of happiness because the painting is to make you smile by the way Mona Lisa smiles on the painting. For instance,you probably tell how a friend is feeling simpyl by the way they face look or how they body type is. Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human emotion to help paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specificemotion. Da Vinci is the first person to decribe soembody emotion of the way they look,the example of the Mona Lisa was to show how Mona Lisa was felling when he was painting the way she looked inside. The facial feedback theory of emotion,just moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them.

The way people are now of days don't like to show how they feel because they feel like they can't tell nobody nothing of how they feel. These computers can help us show how they feel,the compurters can help them with there day. This type of technolgy can help us when a teacher looks at how we feel about how confused we is when he tyring to teach us a lesson.

ae3994d,"Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes the capabilities of new software called the Facial Action Coding System, and provides a few examples of its possible uses. In the text, the author states that the technology, which evaluates the movement of facial muscles to determine emotion, could be beneficial in places such as a classroom settting. Using software such as the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in a classroom setting as it could improve the quality of learning for students.

The new emotion-reading technology could help in the classroom as it could make sure students stayed engaged in the lesson. Often in school, students become bored easily, due to lack of attention long attention spans, uninteresting lessons, or boring teachers. This technology could help eliminate bordom. In the article, Dr. Huang states that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student... [is] bored"" which would be beneficial, as it ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This means that this technology could tell if students are bored, and could alert the teacher. If teachers knew when their students were loosing focus and becoming uninterested in the lesson, they could change it to bring students back on focus, which would improve the productivity and use of time in the classroom because teachers would not be wasting time teaching students who are uninterested, and therefore, likely not listening. By eliminating this bordom factor, teachers would be more effective with their teaching time, and students would recieve a better quality of learning.

The technology could also help improve the quality of students' learning because it can make sure students are not confused. Often, when teachers ask if everyone understands the material, students who do not understand, will be too emabrassed to ask for help, or the teachers, with such a large class, will not notice if one or only a few students are falling behind. Furthermore, in the article, Dr. Huang states that ""'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" meaning that most communication is picked up in other ways, such as visually. Unfortunately, often in a classroom setting, teachers must face away from their students when writing on a white board at the front of the classroom, or in similar situations, which means that without the visual connection, much of the communication between students and teachers is lost. The new technolgoy could help with this problem, as it could identify students' emotions even when a teacher's back is turned, and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons to fit their students' needs. It could also help evaluate emotions that teachers do not notice, such as if a student is confused, they may try to hide it. This new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all of their students understand the material, which would lead to an improved quality of teaching and learning.

The quality of learning in a classroom setting could be improved by teachers knowing the emotions of their students, which would make new technology such as the Facial Action Coding System, valuable in a classroom setting. This technololgy would be beneficial because it could identify whether students are confused or bored, which would make class time more productive and interesting, as well as make sure all students understood the material. This would improve their quality of learning, and make school more meaningful.",5,7,0.8563686609268188

As should by Mona Lisa she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 perfect fearful, and 2 perfect angry."" Therefore the FACS has show. Mona Lisa's emotions just by the coding. As you can see FACS would be great to help out around the world.

Facial Action Coding could help a lot in schools with helping people learn better. Dr. Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" This shows that the classroom with FACS means a classroom where learning can become better. If a student is confused FACS can modify the lesson or help get the student unconfused. Also instead of students zoning out in class Facial Action Coding System will notice it. After FACS notices the student zoning out it can make sure the student zones back into the lesson. FACS can tell is someone is faking being happy. These are all reasons why VACS can help with everyday life.

In the end Facial Action Coding System could change how the school systems and the everyday life of humans are changed.

Based on the text evidence,

"" Making Mona Liza Smile,""

a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. She could have up to six different basic emontions.

First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use she is 83% happy.

Based on this article, "" the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This is saying that even that she shows no expressions, she is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.

Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet she's very mysterious. In the text it says, "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.""

If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing.

The software FACS is interesting becuase it's able to know your emotions with any movement you do. For example, in the text it says, "" even though individuals often show varying degress of expressions. Using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks thsee facial movements."" If a gental move can determine an emotion, this software will have a challenge on finding out Mona Lisa's emotions because it's just a painting.

If you use the Facial Action Coding System it could tell you how they are feeling in the painting and if they are happy or not. You can easliy tell if a person right infront of you is not happy but sometimes you cant. You can use the Facial System on them and it can tell you how they are feeling. Computers can also help out a lot on what you dont understand.

For instance in the Mona Lisa painting you cant tell her emotion in her picture. If you use technology it can help you out and tell you if she is happy or sad. It gives you a percentage like shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. It can give you an estimation on how she is feeling in the picture. The computer has an 3-D computer model so it has all of the face major muscles so it can tell your emotion on your face. It can show your surprised if your eyebrows are raised up or if your angry yuour lips would be tightened to show anger. You can also write down different emotions that you do in the mirror and see if someone can reconize what emotion you have. It can tell if you force a smile and if it wasn't a real one.

If you mix these emotions together you can see all the mixed emotions a person can have and fee and not just a basic emotion. Someone could have a mixture of happiness and disgust at the same time and the system would have recognized the emotions the person was feeling.

This technology would be really effective to have when students are testing or doing a lesson. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lessons, like an effective human instructor. (D'Alto 6)"". This claim that the author made really put things more into prespective on how this new technology would be a great idea to have in schools.

If the student looks confused and the computer recognized this, the teacher can then figure out other ways help the student with the lesson and have a better understanding. The computer can also modify the lesson for the student, so they don't struggle as much while doing the lesson the teacher had asked them to do.

""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. (D'Alto 8)."" This could also help when students are lying. Some students don't want to get in trouble so what they then would do is lie. This would help when the teacher thinks the student isn't being 100% truthful or honest. I also think that this would be very useful in other places and not just schools. This technology can be used when anyone in general isn't being fully honest and can help in any situation.

af3fbe6,"The article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author tells about a new technology called the F.A.C.S. It stands for Facial Action Coding System. The system enables computers to identify human emotions. I think that the use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Yes, there are some aspects of the technology that cause some concerns to people, sure.

Though it may be difficult to except this new technology for some, but in my opinion I would have to say that I think this is a valuable form of technology. They gave the example of how they used the famous known painting by Leonardo da Vinci,

Mona Lisa. This painting includes the portrait of Mona Lisa. She is smiling in the slightest with her hair down and her emotions appear to be happy. The Facial Action Coding System (F.A.C.S.) used the painting to see if it could recognize her emotions. The results appeared to be ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry"". Of course we cannot really know if that was her real feeling at the time but the system concluded that was what she was feeling at the time.

They make the point that we can tell if a friend of ours is happy, sad, angry, fearful, etc.. Though we can not tell for sure, and we definitely would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys all the possible emotions we have. The computer system would make it so we would be able to identify what emotions we were having if needed. The new computer software would store similar anatomical information as electronic code. The F.A.C.S. enables the computers to identify our emotions to an extent that we can not. The system would be helpful in many different situations.

If we had computers that could do such things as they said in office buildings, hospitals, etc..

it would help out a ton. In office buildings they could be used by many people to determine if you're happy with your job or what you're doing at the time being. In hospitals it would be helpful to determine how the patient is feeling. You could put one computer in every room to help and see if a persons facial expressions could tell how they feel at the moment. It would benefit the nurses or the doctors so they would know how often to check up on the patient.

The most helpful place they could be would be in schools. Many teachers give out assingments on the computer most of the time now. If we had the F.A.C.S. in our schools it would help to tell the teachers if we are learning. Our facial expressions give off a lot more information then we would think. As the author said in the article in paragraph six, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" If we had the Facial Action Coding System, it could help the teachers by reporting to them if we seem like we either have the information learned or if we were having difficulties with the homework.

Our face tells a lot, according the the article and Dr. Huang. With the F.A.C.S most of them can all be told. It is a valuable system that most schools should have to determine the emotional expressions each student has. It could raise grades if the teachers would know if we were struggling just by the facial expression we make while doing our homework, test and projects. It is a very advanced system that could cause some problems for sure but the benefits would be outstanding.          ",4,7,0.8403444290161133

If you are in a class with a bunch of other students, the way the lesson is administered can be very generic. Some students may get bored with the way the lesson is being taught. By using the Facial Action Coding System, the computer can identify that a student is bored. It can then go on to modify the lesson to better engage the student. The methods that best help students learn are unique to each individual, so using this technology can make for more engaged and enthusiastic learners.

Some lessons can move too quickly or can simply be difficult to understand. The Facial Action Coding System can detect confusion in students and make changes to the lesson to help the student better understand. The technology can slow the lesson to a pace best suited for the individual. It can also modify the lesson so it is put into terms that the student easily understands. This allows students to move at their own pace and have a better understanding of what they are being taught.

The Facial Action Coding System can also detect when a student is enjoying their lesson. This information can be used to enhance teaching altogether by providing a baseline method for planning each lesson. It can be used to determine what methods are most commonly understood and allow for the modification of lessons for people that don't have access to the technology. By getting a baseline, the information can then be utilized in classrooms even without the technology.

Although there is no definite way to ensure that students will completely understand the things they are taught, the Facial Action Coding System can definitely enhance learning for a better understanding.

You were feeling tired. For me this time would be sitting in my english class learning about Shakespeare. I felt as if the time were never ending in that class. Students all around me had the same facial expression on them. Facial expressions are a huge key of communication. When you are out in public you see many faces around, and you can easily assume their emotions and what they are feeling. With technology being a huge factor in tody's society, we can now use it to determine someone's emotion. I believe that using technology to read emotional expressions on students could really bring forth value in classrooms.

Students all over the school have different things going on. They show and deplict off different emotions at an instant. Sometimes these emotions make it hard for students to concentrate in class during instructions or new lessons given by the teachers. Referring back to the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto, the writer, writes about a new software called the Facial Action Coding System. The new sytem was developed to determine the accuracy of emotions of people around us. If this software were to be implemented in our school, then this could be an advantage in shaping a better society. The software will help teachers determine the emotions students are feeling at the time of lecture. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicting that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Once recognizing the emotions of the student, Dr. Huang continues predicting that the software can ""Then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This will help better the student's understanding in a certain subject without feeling sidetracked or confused with the activites of the teacher.

Although many may argue that the use of this software may bring negative impacts, many like the high cost of implementing it to a public school for everyone to use, or what if the software doesn't work? I could reply by stating that students struggle daily in trying to understand a certain subject in school, this leads them to fail classes or simply drop out of high school. Developing this new software will help students understand their lessons in school and stay focused. The software will also help counselors and teachers determine the emotions of their students. Sadly, many high schoolers have committed suicide because people don't understand what they are feeling, implementing this software to schools will help reduce the rate of suicides and drop outs. In paragraph four of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the writer states ""By weighting the different units, the software can even indentify mixed emotions."" This could help people to better understand each other.

In conclusion, technology has greatly impacted our society and future generations. Things all over us are changing, some changes are good and most may even bring forth new ideas, many like this new software. Placing this new software in schools will help keep them out of confusion with their emotions and education. By the use of this software, students will no longer be falling asleep because the software will help the students concentrate better by adjusting to the abilities of the student to learn. The new system will also help decrease the rate of suicide and drop outs in schools. Implementing new technology will only help make our future better. If we have the chance in changing the world and societies for the better, why not start by understanding each other and our emotions?    ",5,7,0.8782540559768677

Computers have always been known to do just that; keep information and knowlegde. But is that all computers are good for? In the article it states, ""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" This line demonstrates that experts are developing new technology that could allow for computers to interact more with humans. By developing the technology, new opportunities will arise and improve the quality of life.

A common issue in this era is people accusing others of doing something they did not do. If someone accuses another of an emotion, that could possibly make the person mad even if that was not their original emotion. In the text it states, "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication,' "" This line supports that humans tend not to communicate. Therefore, accsuing someone of a certain emotion could be wrong. Another line in the text states, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."", This line proves humans have trouble recongnizing certain facial expressions. Without the help of computers, humans struggle to read emotions of people such as their friends. However, happy, sad, anger, worry, etc. are not the only emotions especially for a teen.

During school, teenagers show mutiple emotions. Some may be more obvious than others. A common emotion for teens in school is boredom or confusion. Sometimes a student does so well at hiding it that the teacher does not know what they are feeling. Which is why computers could help figuring out the emotions. In the text it states, "" 'A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or board, ' Dr. Huang predicts."" This line demonstrates that students can get bored and confused with what they are doing in class. A teacher may change their teaching style but some may not know what is going on inside the students mind. This quote states, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more exspensive-for video games or video surgery."" This line supports that showing emotions when in front of a computer screen will have a wide variety of benefits. Showing facial expression could possibly improve games and other online tasks.

Computers have improved many things in life. Calculating emotions is one of many amazing abilities of technology. By donating money to experts, who develop new technology, can allow them to create more ideas and show the world the successful invention.                  ",4,7,0.7041668891906738

I think that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a brilliant idea.

I support the new tecnology because Dr. Paul Ekman has classified six basic emotions such as - happiness,anger,surprise,disgust,sadness, and fear - and then associated each emotion with different movements of the facial muscles or characteristics. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrow when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) thightens your lips to show anger. The fact that there is classification on these six emotions just add on to the fact that this tecnology can become the next big thiing in todays society.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" ;""even though individuals often show varrying degrees of expressions"" Quoted from section (4)

meaining that the smile isn't as broad as normal and the fact that there is video imagray based off of the ""Facial Action Coding System"" (FACS) by using different units and weighing them is amazing and how they can tell your expressions just by veiwing your face and comparing it to a nuetrual face that isn't showing any emotion meaning the face doesn't show -happiness, sadness, anger, surpise, fear, and discust. I beleive that the Facial Action Coding System is a very brilliant form of technology and should be used on painting for many years to come because being able to finally tell the ""Mona Lisa's"" expression or facial recognition is amazing I couldve never told you if that painting was happy sad and or even angry and having a system that can do so is brilliant and extreamly useful. These are some of the resons that I personaly believe this system is worth using because it helps better understand peoples and or paintings expressions or faces. ",2,7,0.8451350331306458

Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. New software has been developed that improves accurancy in perceiving the emotions of others. This new software, the Facial Action Coding

System, has promising applications for a variety of industries.

I personality will like to have technology to read my emotional expressions . it would be fun to have that in school .

It shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when your're happy or sad. ''The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive - for video games or video surgery'' said Dr,Huang.

Dr. Huang and his colleague experts are developing better ways for humans and computer to communicate. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscules. It haves Six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associasted each with characterisctic movments of the facial muscles.

This is how it works It's all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smlie and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles taht begin at your cheek bones) lift the corner of your mouth. (That's our instruction #1.) Muscles are called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes.(That's instruction #2.)

I agree that students should have this Facial Action Coding System in schools. Not only well it help by reading emotions but it may also help for students that want to be actors and people that like doing art and like painting faces. Dr. Huang and his colleague are very smart for making

The Facial Action Coding System for school.                    ",3,7,0.9031347632408142
b0f3d31,"The use of this advanced technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable from three reasons in the article that the author tells us by reading this article.

It's interesting to think ahead and create something big that no one can do. In paragraph 3, the author says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" The 44 muscles can tell how the human is feeling, by seeing how the person is moving. For example, when the person is moving really fast, it means that the person might be angry or aggressive. But when a person is moving slow, it means that the person is sad or depressed.

The author tells in the text, ""We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day."" But comparing a human mind to a computer is different. A human mind can think that the friend is feeling sad, but the computer can have more than just one idea of how the friend feels. The computer can have more than one idea by scanning the face of the person and calculating how the muscles of the face look. It may seem amazing to try to use the technology.

From the picture of Mona Lisa, when you just look at it, many ideas would pop up in your head from trying to guess how she's feeling and how she looks. There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" Some people might say that she looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture.

Moreover, the article gives us a lot of information of the advanced technological computer that constructs a 3-D model, to scan a human face and tell how the person feels emotionally. It's amazing and interesting to even read about Dr. Huang and Prof. Sebe ,his colleague, are both experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.",2,7,0.778868556022644
b109620,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This system has changed the Mona Lisa painting. It has made her smile. It detected that she had a sad emotion and changed it to a smile. Now the question is; should we use this on students in a classroom? This could actually tell teachers of how their students emotions are, because sometime you can't tell someone's emotions.

I don't think we should use this in classrooms on students. I think it would waste valuable time for the teacher to actually teach. Many people like to hide their emotions. The article made a statement about your smile. "" They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" Sometimes you feel the need to force a smile. You do it because you know it's the right thing to do. If we detect that that was a false emotion, then it could make many people fell very upset. It could also have many advantages too. It could let the teacher know how students emotions change from a different type of lesson. Maybe the students are more actice to participate during a different type of lesson, so that the teacher knows which way is the best to teach. The Facial Action Coding System has its advantages ,but could also lead to many disadvantages.

The Facial Action Coding System is great piece of technology. I don't think it would be something that is used very much. Dr. Huang said that, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements. The technology invloved in this system is amazing, I just don't think many people would actually take the time to use it. ",3,7,0.845598578453064

For instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the way they have a look on their face. Of course, most of us have trouble describing each facial expression on how u feel an why u feel that way or have that look on your face. My conclusion is that in ife were not gonna need technology to sense our emotion just trust someone or look yourself into the mirror and let all youe expressions out but it's better to know how your feeling instead of technology see how your feeling deep down inside you.",2,7,0.8234490752220154
b15337d,"In this article called,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it explains an advanced technology that can identify what humans are feeling on the inside. This technology is attention grabbing and seems so futuristic. The Facial Action Coding System claims to have lots of uses. I think that this new technology could be very useful in a learning environment. The Facial Action Coding System could benefit a classroom setting by being able to tell if the student is completely understanding the material, being able to tell if a student if bored and zoning out, and by seeing if you are enjoying the lesson.

A lot of times students do not understand the information that is being pushed on them and are too afraid to ask questions. Teachers can't read a students mind, and teachers aren't a computerized system to identify if a student is understanding the concepts in class. Students are often too afraid and embarrassed to ask questions in class and for that sake, they just don't do it. From personal experience as a student, this can be frustrating and doesn't benefit my education. The new Facial Action Coding System could change the way people learn on a whole new level by being able to identify confusion, and then breaking down the concepts more. Having a system that can identify if students are confused could be extremely beneficial on lots of different levels.

Students sit through classes for up to 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That makes me bored just thinking about it. A student is bound to zone out and not to mention get bored throughout the day. It's not wrong to be teaching the material that needs to be taught, but making it a little more interesting could benefit everyone. A system that can detect if a student is getting bored and incorperating more interesting topics into the lesson would be beneficial to everyone. That could make a students life a lot less stressful, and a teachers life a lot easier.

Some students think other topics are more interesting than others. Which is just a matter of opinion, but I found in my years of schooling that it will be a lot easier to learn material if you are enjoying it. I believe that every student has the ability to enjoy learning about something during their years of school. The Facial Coding System could speed up the process of finding interesting topics for a student a lot easier. Sometimes it takes years to find a topic in school that you enjoy, but if we had this new technology available to us, it could help students enjoy what they are learning a lot more.

The Facial Action Coding System has many ways to benefit how we learn. Understanding the material completely, being engaged in the topics, and even enjoying to learn in school. I believe that if we had to ability to do those things, and had that technology in front of us. That there is no reason students wouldn't benefit from it. It could change learning in a whole new way for students. So why wouldn't we give the Facial Action Coding System a try in the classroom?    ",5,7,0.8448995351791382
b1624e2,"The use of this techonolgy so called Facial Action Coding,is not valuable at all. As technology may be advancing that doesn't mean it can't fail us. Reading a persons facial expression will not determine their mood. Like the author said, "" The facial expressions for each emoton are unversial."" It could also have to do with their body language. Weither the person is slouching or always hiding their hands, also how their voice level is. Sure it could be easier by going at a painting, but in your point of view it's a whole different story.

Body language can determine many different things in someone. It could be weither you have a back problem, trying to grab your back because of the pain. Slouching could be not because you are tired, but maybe a syptom of depression. Since the computer is only recognizing your emotion(s). I personally do not think a computer could read or tell you that.

Voice level could be one of many signs of emotion. If one is scared or frightend, your voice can let out a shriek. One can be happy and still have either that low or a more louder voice. Computers can't figure this out and we are trying to depend on some code that was invented. In the text it says, ""muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes."" How can a muscle determine your emotion. One could be confuesd or trying to see more clearly because of the vision.

Your point of view is better than a computers understanding. Seeing a person face to face can maybe change something. They could be happy and here you come with that sad face. Then the seeing the persons emotion makes you suddenly feel better. A computer can't see what just happend between you and the person.

The Facial Action Coding System can also be valuable in the classroom by helping the teacher understand the student is counfused without verbaly talking to the student.

First it was the car, then phones, now facial action coding system. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" written by Nick D'Alto, the idea of having technology to do decode what emotion you are feeling is central to popular belief. The idea that a camera with a few buttons would be able to tell how you are feeling is absolutely impeccable. The everyday use of technology should not become normal. This society needs to know that soon enough everything will be controlled by technology.

The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" has many ideas that I do not agree with. Starting with the fact that putting a facial action coding system in a classroom will be the same as if an effective teacher were to be there. The demonstration of this system itself seems very interesting, but only in the right place and the right time. In paragraph six Doctor Huang explains ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" this mean that the computer will be there physically but will rarely give any verbal or emotional communication. Putting this in a classroom full of students and having it code their emotions is not only a crime to teachers everywhere but also to the students. Not only do the students need someone physically to be there, they also need someone to model for them. All students have different ways of learning. If the students who learn by the teacher modeling, they won't be doing very good with the computer.

Not only do the students need a teacher there as a figure to respect and trust, but they also need their own privacy. Doctor Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" this is not necessarily a good thing. If the computer is watching their every move and facial or emitonal expression they would feel like they are constantly being watched. This is a feeling the children should not be exposed to at an age where you are just being a kid. If the students are being watched, they are then mainly apart of a science experiment that they did not agree to and that is not right.

The final reason why this computer would not be effective with the kids is that there is a liability factor when it comes to putting one of these in your classroom. You have to think about what the parents' will have to say. Doctor Huang also includes ""If you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" this means that the computer is watching every single move you do while you are searching the web. The camera is turned on and who knows if a person might be watching you through the other end. Many parents or even potential buyers may not want this from new technology.

In conclusion, technology will be apart of our everyday lives whether we like it or not. The different types of technology that we use is what we can control. The Facial Action Coding System is the type of technology that students and teachers should steer clear of.

It is a lot of work getting one of those and the thing is why buy it or even consider it, if it is not offical.

The facial action coding system is not totaly offical. In the story it says that it uses you face to tell what going on or something. They say that they can tell if it is a real smile or a fake one by your muscules. The muscles called orbicularis make croe's feet around your eyes, but then a fake smile, the mouth is streched sidesways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius.

Sense it said that it can tell eveything just by four face. The rusults won't be right. For people that wear makeup the facial action coding system is not going to get the right results. You might have a facial problem or something wrong with you muscles. That you wouldn'd be able to simle perfectly. Then it will give you wrong results

The fact that facial action coding system is basiclly thinking and telling you how to feel it doesn't really know what you really feel.

This technology allows us to know how a person is feeling or allows us to know how a person was feeling when a picture was taken. For example,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent happy."" This evaluation of emotion is from the painting of Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo Da Vinci. Even though it was just a picture or a painting, this technology identified all sorts of emotion. There could be several other instances when this new emotion-recognition sofware could come in handy.

This could either strenghten our friendship or maybe break our friendship and so with this, we can detect/identify a lot of things.

This can be very useful for the media to detect when someone is lying. This new invention tells us that faces never lie.

In paragraph one the experts states that ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Meaning this data isn't just something from a lab science teacher this is acurrate data from a new coming modern software. Having a computer connect with humans on a different level than just historical information can only help the society. Experts are only trying to better the way the human brian and body functions. In the text it states that Dr. Huang and Dr. Nicu are coming together to increase better communication between computers and humans. ""are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"". These two master minds are making sure readers know every step by step it takes to create this software without doing any harm. For example ""computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Meaning the software must reflect off a human like body or it wouldn't function correctly. ""Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit"". After the doctors finds out what it takes for the software to be a sucess they then go deeper into networking with a psychologist. Reaching out to the creater of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) Dr. Paul Eckman. Knowing that this software isn't basic Eckman simply starts out with the software using only the six basic emotions, which are happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness. In the text it states that these facial expressions are world wide ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", Experts say that the FACS can identify true emotions through a real face or painted one ""the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real or painted face"". In paragraph 5 it states that experts studied closely to make sure a painted face could be useful with the software ""studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"". This new software can help students function in the classroom when they are confused or bored they can easily get help rather than being ignored ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" says Dr. Huang. Using this software can let others know when someone is genuine happy or if they are just putting on a show. ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"". experts say in a real smile the corners of your mouth is lifted rather in a forced on your mouth is being stretched.

I think that this is a good creation because if you dont know how someone if feeling in a picture you can figure out by this machine. I aslo think this a good creation beacuse its taking technology to a new level. You might ask how is it taking technology to a new level. Its taking it to a new level because there actually building a machine that tells how someone if feeling. Thats just amazing! Thats one reason why I like this machine.

People might wonder how do they know how someone is feeling through a picture. Or people might think maybe there's just putting something to make it seem real just make us think. Cause it's not possibly to show someone feeliing from a picture because you don't how that person is feeling inside. So thats why this machine can be bad.

I personally think thats this is a bad creation becuase its a waste of time to me. Why would anybody want to know how someone is feeling through a picture. When there reaction shows how they are feelings. Thats why I dont like this machine. This machine is pointless!

b3ef813,"The author makes a very valid point that caught me and kept me to his or her side. He or she stated that using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in a classroom could help improve the enviroment in the class. We've all had those lessons in school where we weren't quite getting it, or we had lost interest in the subject. The FACS could help us with this along with many other things that could turn valuable.

The Facial Action Coding System works by using all of the 44 major muscles in the human face. It is programmed to understand how those muscles work and what it means when those muscles move. Meaning, if I were to smile, the system would recognize that I'm happy and could continue on with the lesson. If I were to frown and look angry, the system would know that I'm unhappy and could find another route for me to learn the lesson.

With this technology, students don't have to worry about the lessons that they struggle with. This technology allows the computer to know their emotions and base their learning off of how they feel. If I don't understand a math problem on the computer and I have a confused look on my face, the computer analyzes my look and knows that I need more help. The computer knowing that allows me to get more help and understand the topic.

FACS doesn't just have to be in a learning facility. It could be at your work, someday your home, and even used for security purposes. When we place FACS in some sort of work place, like an office. An office can get a little tense and stressful. With the knowledge in FACS, the computers used can realize that the user is under a lot of stress and might need a break. We could also use it for facial recognition in security cameras, laptops, desktops, even phones. And with the possibility of one day putting such technology in a home, it's crazy! Not only could you work on house work, but any other school work with FACS!

The possibilities are pretty endless with FACS. The ideas go on and on with this type of technology, and I fully support this author and what he or she is trying to do.",4,7,0.8803209662437439
b3f07d4,"Technology seems to advance further and further everday. We see new softwares and devices coming out fairly often. Although this technology is created, many people have opinions on how it will actually help in the long run. With the Facial Action Coding System, I believe this software is going to help in many ways. It will make all kinds of positive change in the classroom and even in places of work.

One positive change I believe it would make is to help children learn in the classroom. Kids have a tendency to get bored in class while learning, and often stop paying attention. This is a bad habit that can easily be fixed with the Facial Action Coding System. This software can detect change in emotion and help keep things interesting in the classroom. The author, Nick D'Alto, states that,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This software is the perfect way to always have the attention of students.

Another reason I think this Facial Action coding System is extremely valuable in the classroom is because it works with children all over the world. I believe that is extremely important. Children all over the world will be getting a higher education while having a better experiece, because their school time will be spent learning about things they enjoy, and not staring a screen with blank minds. D'Alto writes that, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" So this software can be used anywhere and on anyone very efficiently.

Although this software has some great benefits, it also has a downfall. One problem with the Facial Action Coding system is the price. I'm sure given the amount of detals and time put into it, it comes with a bit of a price tag. Some schools may not be able to afford it. This is still a great product though, and it should still be available to the schools that can afford it. Many schools would find this to be helpful, and most likely invest. Eventually, as the software becomes more common, access to it will become easier and the price will not be a problem.

While most technology has a few slight inconviences, this software only seems to have one. The Facial Action Coding System seems to be extremely innovative. I hope to see this product in schools soon, available to children. The boredom and confusion of these children will no longer exist, which will make these kids all the more happier to go to school and continue their education.               ",4,7,0.8495489358901978

All over the world teachers wonder what is going through the minds of their students, and are often unsure. However, technology from the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the Univerity of Illinois, is being designed that can detect and determine facial expressions, giving teachers and students an advantge in the classroom.The use of Facial Action Coding System is valuable because it helps students stay engaged, and understand the material, while also helping teachers to run the classroom more effectivly.

The use of the FACS in classroom helps students who are confused about their course work. The system can help with this, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.The system can then change the method being applied, to one the student will understand. The system will remember which method helped the student more and use the same method in the future. This helps the student to learn in the way that make the most sense to them. Another advantage of FACS is it helps student to continue to be engaged.

FACS can detect when a student is bored and modify the acitvity so the student is once again engaged. FACS can detect certain emotions and bored is one of the emotions. Certain facials muscles move when a sutdent is bored with the activtity assigned, the system recongizes these movements and, according to Dr. Huang, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This helps the student to continue with the coursework, and stay engaged.

A value aspect of FACS, it is can help teacher run classrooms more effectivly. Many classrooms are overcroweded, but teachers feel the pressure of giving each student personal attention. However many can not due to disengaged student who distrupt class. With the FACS system helping to resolve this number of students, teachers will once again be able to help student individually, enabling them to be more effective, and put their efforts where it is most valuable.

Using the Facial Actions Coding System is beneficial in many areas, but is especially valuable in a classroom setting. FACS can detect six basic emotions, and modify assignment to keep student engaged, and help with confusion. With

this technology from the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the Univerity of Illinois, teacher will have a better idea of what students are thinking and more able to help them more effectivly, giving individual attention to students who need it, as well as lower the number of class interuptions from disengaged students.",4,7,0.7880182862281799

Using facial action coding for students in a classroom is valuble. This is becuase it can be used to help better teach students. Its especially valuble becuase the software can modify lesson plans, as well as be used in simmulatons, and the software can be easily implemented in classrooms. This technology would also boost productivity in students.

Using facial recognition would be important because it can be used to modify lesson plans, based on the emotions detected. In other words if a student is bored or confused, the software can detect it and can make the lesson more attention grabbing, or use a different teaching method. An example of this was mentioned in the article when Dr. Huang said, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (D'alto, 1). This is important becuase it gives direct evidence of the plans for this technology, and a method it could be used effectivly on students.

The technology can be used in learning simulations. This is valuble becuase more human communication is non verbal. Dr. Huang notes, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that, too"" (D'alto, 1). In using this technology we can create more human like and responsive simulations, that can be implemented in classrooms. This could help create more life like surgery simulations or anything envolving human interaction or communication.

Some might argue that the technology would be difficult to implement, but despite popular belief it is relativly easy to implement. Despite most technology not being able to decode somewhat incripted messages in famous works of art such as the Mona Lisa it can still be used to encode different emotions. Nick D'Alto writes, ""we can still write down some simple instructions that 'encode' different emotions."" (page, 1). This quote shows that it's not difficult for a larger span of people to begin using this technology, and our schools education could be significantly changed at a relativly low expense.

To conclude facial action coding technology is valuble to classrooms. Not only can it be used to modify lesson plans, and improve simulations, despite common belief it can also be easily implemented. Overall it can be used to amplify productivity though easily implementing this Facial Action Coding System.          ",4,7,0.8371708989143372

""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions"" (D'Alto). The article by Nick D'Alto,

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about a new software, the Facial Action Coding System which can recognize emotions based on muscle movements. Some people think this technology can be useful for many industries, however it can have negative effects on some. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classrom is not valuable.

Students may have personal issues and it is not necessary for classroom's to know the emotions an individual is going through. As the article explains how muscle movements connect with how someone feels, it states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions---happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" (D'Alto). This demonstrates that the technology can only dectect a few emotions. The technology may get confused and it could determine an incorrrect emotion. The Facial Action Coding System does not offer enough emotions and could therefore make a mistake. In a classroom, students do not need a computer to inform the emotions they feel. Instead, students should learn to communicate how they feel with words. Not every emotion should be shared. They may have a problem at home or could be getting bullied. The emotions shown from the technology will just make the case worse. It is not valuable to use technology to understand emotions of others. When the article explains how every emotion is universal, it states, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)"" (D'Alto). This statement is not valid because it is not possible to have no emotion. Every thought, question, word, and sentence has emotion. This means the Facial Action Coding System does not have accurate results.

A classroom should not have a piece of technology that has no purpose. Teachers should ask for feedback and have students express their emotion whichout a device. Technology should not take over feelings. A computer problem could take away jobs of teachers. The Software will only make things worse in the classroom, which proves it is not useful.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System is not vaulable in a classroom because the technology does not provide accurate emotions of students, does not teach students life skills, and it makes the situation worse. Students should focus on communicating with each other and not developing ways for humans and computers to communicate.    ",4,7,0.8900708556175232

First, people have many different emotions. Most of humans would have trouble describing each favial trait. Whenever someone tightens their lips that mean that they are in anger. Computer can recognize the subtle facial movements that human use to express how they feel. When someone make a movement of one or more muscles that is called ""action unit.""

Then, many characters can make a movements of facial muscles. For example, when you are surprise, you have your mouth open and raises your eyebrows. Each expresseion that people makes is compared against a neutral face. Muscular action units indicate the difference between a genuine smile and forced one.

Computers can tracks your facial movements and expressions. Computers stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. For example, computer can recognize when you are becoming confused or bored.

In Conclusion, Making a facial movements and expression while communicating with others is important because it will tell the others how you feels.

b5b5033,"Can a facial action code system accurately detects human emotions? Making Mona Lisa Smile is written by Nick D'Alto,and it points out the fact how computers can tell how emotions by calculation. A technology known as the facial action coding system enables computers to indentify human emotions. Some of the advantages of the computers is that it can observe, calculate and identify the human muscles.

One way the computers can identify how emotions is by observing the 44 major muscles bone in human. Creating a 3-D model of the face the computers has been able to observe this muscles and where they are located in the body and their movement, in paragraph one the text states that ""

the process begins when the computers constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. without observation of this mucles movement in the body the computer wouldn't be able to indentify the muscles that actually produce this emotions. Therefore they also need to calculate like humans.

in anothert different way the computers have been able to calculate this bones that makes this emotions in the body through the producers. The producers observes the way human tell emotions by calculation, on paragraph five the text states that "" in fact we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking on her face. Calculation is one important thing the computers need to do for better result without them calculating like humans they would probably give us wrong result, and they can do this by observation of the bones shape. whereby can tell emotions.

Way other way computers would provide specific answer like angry, happy... is by knowing the parts of the body to identify the positions of the bone. Emotions as we know can be told by looking at the face at an individual face, on paragraph 7 it says ""while looking at the mirror: raise your lips at the cornersof your mouth, then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (""cow's-feet) at the corner of your eyes, holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up. toward your eyes"" basically the computer has to identify parts of your body to detects the bones which can produce excellent result.

In conclusion, we can now see that computers can actually detect exactly and maybe more accurately than human's. struggling everyday to find out if he or she has actually forgiving you about yesterday would be more easy than ever. Through calculation and observation we see the ability and capacity of how this technology can make our life easier, teacher wouldn't have to confirm if students understand the topic if they act like they do.

The author of this article explains why emotional technology is helpful. Looking in perspective of people in school, in work, or just living people are creating technology that is more intelligent than the smartest person in the world. Seeing what life has come to now, why not add another ingredient to making artificial intelligence work more and make our lives a little less complicated. Along with several other opinions, others should also think of the great posibilities this could have in store for the future.

Starting off, this new ""emotional"" technology could be very useful in plenty of ways leading to just knowing instead of the unknown. As said in the article, ""Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions—happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness—and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" Using psychologists's intelligence, the technology will be pretty accurate due to the research and major ability of the creators. Readers may say, ""Plenty of people make plenty of different facial expression and emotional expression!"", but according to a psychologist's claim he agrees to disagree. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,” observes Dr. Huang..."" (paragraph 4, line 1) ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements—in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" (paragraph 4, line 2) Taking from those quotes, there is thechnology for all of the worries in the world!

One of the worries could include the relationships. Those worries include friendships, love, family, etc. The author said in the article, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" People may have friends that hardly open up or just need help, but don't know how to talk about issues concerning themselves or the relationship. Normally people could tell if something is wrong because of the time span of the relationship, but if they can't they can rely on this technology. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" The facial expression of the companion that people may have may be different, but this new technology can make relationships way less confusing. Involving communication, as said in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This quote proves that communicationa and relationships can benefit from this new age technology.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,” Dr. Huang predicts. “Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.”"" Yes, the new computer science can make education more efficient. It seems as if the technology would be used in a classroom both the teachers and students could benefit. While teachers are doing their job students will either be intent and getting the main idea, or be bored and confused. ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive—for video games or video surgery.""

Students can have a more fun and easy education with new software for classes like computer science, anatomy, etc.

In conclusion, whether people want this technology for school, work, or just plain life it is suitable. The future of many people could benefit in the use of emotional truth behind many things like family aspects, political aspects, or commercial aspects. Having this technology could eventually lead to better learning industries and just a better future for people in general.                                 ",5,7,0.829461932182312

In the exerpt it says that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Two minuets ago i would have never guessed that, but it's a good thing to know that. If it were to be a student, to knwo that he/she is maybe angry is very helpful in that it shows that we cant push them or tell them to do something the same way we normally would. We need to descelate the situation and make this person more on the happy side before we do anything else.

Yes it is a little odd to think that a humans facial structure can be generated on on a comuter, but at the same time it was only amatter of time before this would happen. in fact, this happens all the time for movies and video games. The face has 44 muscles and the computers generatin of the face must have the same exact 44 muscles in it in order to read and produce a human like analyzation of a face.

Weather what we have right now is that acurate, i'm not sure, but what i do know is that it is impresive.

People like Dr. Huang relie on the work of a psychologist like Dr. Paul Eckman who is the creator of FACS which stands for Facial Action Coding System. The exerpt says that Eckman has descovered the following emotions due to the muscle movements. Happy, sad, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness. The example given in the text is the frontal pars lateralis muscle or above your eyes rise when you are suprised.

Overall i do believe that this would be helpfull to read a students emotion to show how to aproach him or her and to show what to say and how to say it. Everything is dependent on how you say things nowadays. If you say one thing wrong that person may go off on you or may take it really well you just never know, but if that person is angry then you may want to aproach that person with care instead of just going at them full speed.",3,7,0.8065446615219116

Movement of one or more muscl is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psycologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding System ). Eckman has classified six basic emotions---happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. ''

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expenssive--- for video games or surgery. The Facial Action Coding System is a great help because then we can determine is some one is happy or sad , depending on face expression that they make in the picture according to the computer.

The Facial Action Coding System does calculate a little bit of the persons emotions depending on your facial expression. It even shows how you can try this at home. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. They detect the muscle "" orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus ''                                 ",1,7,0.8503609299659729
b6352d7,"The article ""Making mona Lisa Smile"" I learned about a new type of software that can recognize a persons emotions. this process is based on all 44 differnt muscles in our faces. The software scans your face and sees what muscles are moving and how, based on the emotion you are feeling. This is a huge step in technology and I feel could be both very instrumental and not for our future use of computers at the same time. We use computers constantly nowadays, we are always on them, and we do need them to grasp certain concepts, like emotions better, but I feel this new software might be invasive to a lot of people.

My opionion on this technology is that it is amazing and very useful. one point brought up in the passage was using the software for students to see how they are grasping a lesson. It would be very helpful for my laptop to know when I was frustrated and be able to help me, or better explain my lesson to me. I also see its use in videogames, having better computer-animated faces could be very useful and cool in a videogame. I also believe that this software can be used in videogames to see when youre struggleing with or enjoying differnt parts of the game.

This software is very invasive though. im not very keen on the idea of my computer watching me and scaning my face constantly. I think the idea of using the facial recognition to see which kinds of web ads I'd like to see is too much. I know most people are already bothered by the fact that our cameras on our phones and computers are already recording us, but the idea that they are scanning our faces and seeng our emotions will make many people uncomfortable.

Another reason to not use this technology is that it is one step closer to making artificial inteligence comonplace, which I personaly don't thinkl we should do. We can not control our technology if it gets out of hand, and giving our computers all the information we can about emotions, how to create them ,and recognizing them is a bad idea.

In conclusion, I think using this software in small amounts could be very useful. though stated in the article, could be challenging to use on our everyday computers and phones because they can not handle the complex algorithms used. This new advancement is definitely a step foreward with education and how we learn, but may be a step backward with privacy. I feel thast many students will appriciate the technology and welcome it. Only time can tell how this becomes a part of our lives. I do hope it will be a miniscule one. ",4,7,0.864106297492981

Should the info provided by the machine lead to somting bigger than just emotions? This divce could either help people or desroy people in its own way: or it could also be a complete fail.

The use of this device in class rooms would be great in a way;so the teachers could see whats going on with one of there students. On a total other note not every one can express there feelings through facial expresions; even some people tend to portray others emotional states wich leads to imataion. So personally I would not want to have this at my school. For there will be a complete disaster (people can always fake ).

In the text the writer was talking about ""empathy (the feeling of someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate other persons facial expreions'(found in paragraph 9).Another example from the text would be we dont neccacerly need a machine to predict others emotuions. In the text it stated that to an expert faces dont lie ;that muscles are a clue .Also that a false smile can be predicted by the facial mucles: in the text it stated that ""the mouth is stretched side ways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risourius"".

In conclusion the machine would not be valuable in a class room. There are many other things to focus on/in class that using the machine would be a complete waist of time. A way students could be checked on instead is by communicting with them or directing them in the correct direction.

The software is easy to indicate people true feelings and inner thoughts on how people are feeling and what's there mood right now . The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System can tell your emotions if your feeling happy, sad , angry, or disgusted. The software is good for people if they don't want to express there feelings towards others.

People use face reconition alot and it can be a quicker way to get into your tablets and phones or any other electronics, but people can easily crack into the electronic and take any personal infomation that they need. I mean electonic ability to read people's emotions is cool and all, and its a huge next step into newer tecnology for the future, but the fact that you know say you needed to be happy to get into your phone, some one else can act happy and, well unlock your phone.

In paragraph six the article talks about how they could make different ads show if you were happy or frowning. That could be good but if your watching, like youtube or videos and an ad shows, your going to want to keep watching your video and not the ad. If a person is watching a show and an ad pops up and they smile, then it shows another ad that the person didnt want to see because they wanted to keep watching thier show. I think people would be angry if that happen, because not a lot of people like ads. Ads can be good for promotion of products, but i think we all know when your playing a game on your electronic device that you want to keep playing or watching and not the ad.

Technology does not tell how people feel because the results of people's feelings may not be accurate. It does not detects how really happened. Also, it don't express people's personal issues. Just because people smile, don't mean they're really happy. Some people may frown. But that does not mean if they are really upset.

You never know how people feel because they do that just to make it seem like everything is okay. But things they people go throught is not alright. Technology does not tell the actually truth when it comes to personal problems. Also, it will not express what people have going on in their life. The results when technology will not be a hundred percent true about human emotions.

Technology are not always accurate about people. Dectecting people's emotions may by looking at facial expressions by technology will not work out. Technology is for research, networks, tools,power points, and also microsoft word. Technology on my opinion don't determine people's mood. But technology can show things that you don't know about.

Finally, Technology does not determine people's emotions. Technology is for research about thing or people that you don't know about. It can't show you the truth about people's emotions.

b6a5a2a,"Recently, a machine was created with the ability to calculate how a person is feeling based on facil structures. Scientists around the world are prasing this technology. I believe that even though this technology is impressive, it is completely unneccecery because of one major thing. The fundemental flaw of this system is the fact that it is a machine in the first place.

Machines are purely artifical beings that cannot feel nor comprehend human emotions on their own. As a result, their knowledge of emotions is only as good as their programmer's preception. In addition, the way this system detects emotions means that it can easily be cheated. A person could very easily fool the system into thinking they are happy by pulling a fake smile. Lastly, this system can only sense emotions based on appearences when about half of what determines how a person is feeling is based on their thoughts.

In conclusion, this system, while good, is completely broken because of how it functions. The only way a system like this could ever function effectively is if it could literally read minds. Emotions are complex things that cannot be decipered through simple algorythems. In the end, this system is only good for judgeing books by their covers.",3,7,0.7301085591316223

when you look at the mona lisa it brings a smile to your face. It shows you how much a computer can do. The computer knows when you are sad and happy. It's like a dog knowing when you are upset or happy.

Not everything should be abe to be on the computer alot of things aren't even on the paper. It's all online. It take a lot of emotions. When you paint monia lisa you are puting emotions on the way that it being painted. It can be different on every painting but it shows more emotions then having it online. When working online with emotions. When it's online it not how it done. The computer is doing with what some people want. Emotions shouldn't be read by computer becuse they do mess up and someone would have to fix what the computer picks out. emotions should be painted or drawed out on a paper not on a screen that you can easily delete. When on paper make a mistake then easer it. It shows maybe using the coumputer's can mess what they want. ",2,7,0.7825253009796143
b6da4bf,"All humans face difficulties at all times in their life. Humans aren't always going to be happy every second of everyday. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author is expressing the new technology, the Facial Reaction Coding System. This is able to identify human emotions. I am against this technology on reading students emotional expressions. Students go through school and come across bad times and stressful times and not every student likes to show that.

Students go through emotions quite frequently and even when noticing one has a great big smile on their face, doesn't exactly mean they are happy. For an example, in paragraph 5, it states ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This shows that anyone can make any face just to show one is ""happy"" or ""sad,"" others may not want people knowing how sad you actually are deep down. Everyone is different in their own ways, but for me being a student in high school and if i am ever sad, i show a smile on my face so not everyone is noticing my sadness and asking me what's wrong. Therefore, in paragraph 7,

""They even indicate the diiference between a genuine and a forced one."" This is showing how the software and the movements in the mucles show the difference between an actual smile and a forced one. Not every student in highschool is going to know the difference on the movement in muscles unless they are studying it. There is a reasoning on why there isn't a bubble on top of our heads revealing our thoughts. One good example from paragraph 6 states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too.""

If one wants to express how they feel towards a family member, or friend, etc then thats on them for wanting people to know their business and talk about it with soemone else. Undertsanding the thought of understanding yourself, each and every individual has their own thoughts on things and many things that come across the head is always secured within yourself and never left your mouth which doesn't mean it needs to be notified by a computer either.

I strongly believe each student should be able to express their feelings how they want, if that means hiding their real emotions or embracing their real emotions. If one is upset and has something going on in their life, they know how they feel and don't need a computer operating all their thoughts. This is why i am against having this software of identifying human emotions. ",3,7,0.785548985004425

Mona Lisa

What is the difference between smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage - says Constantin Stanislavvsky. Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?

We humans everyday perform or express the same impressive ""calculation"" such as any subject like math homework or science. Through all this the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. In paragraph 6 lines 6 and 7 this states that while the use of technology can read our emotional expressions ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. In the use of technology then it could modify the use of how people have their emotions and expressions.

Meanwhile, some computers can handle the use of emotions people have and their expressions depedning on how they calculate emotions. Not only can the computer detect the feelings it makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting. In paragraph 4 the first line the article says that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ''even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). However, everyone has emotions, feelings, and expressions, but some you can not verify or tell how they are feeling or whether they tell you they do not know what is their suggestion to it. Computers need to know that as well.

As in paragraph 2, everyone has emotions that just you can not verify or tell of how they are feeling or their confused and bored. In excluslive this software can be very valuable to many students in very many ways although, it is going to help them with observing many emtional faces and expressions. Not just the computers can help them observe the faces in paragraph 6 lines 8, 9, and 10 ""The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Within this information if students feel sad, worried, and happy this all at once the software in the computer can still detect the emotions of this human or painting.

It takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it it takes less muscles just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling, when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7 line 8 ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. It is all about the muscular action units.

In paragraph 9 lines 2, 3, and 4 it says ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. In this information, To an expert or computer system, faces do not lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smilimg"" politician or celebrity is not being truthful. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!                                                                      ",3,7,0.8426119089126587
b6fdfe8,"Wouldn't it be remarkable if in the future, computers could read you facial expression and tell exactly how you feel? In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" We now know it's possible, and thanks to the latest innovation in the technology world to Proffesor Thomas Hauang it could be sooner than we think. This new software, known as the Facial Action Coding System, is able to read your emotional expressions which is shown to be very promising to the educational system. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vauble becasue it could regonize if a student is bored or confused, it could also modify the lesson in order for the student to learn better.

First, this technology could be used to tell if student are confused, bored, happy etc. Shown in the article in the 6th paragraph the author states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huand predicts."" And prefaces by stating, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent."" If applied in the educational sence this could mean that the computer could see the students is confused and be able to spend more time trying to help that student comprehend the material. The computer could also modify the lesson.

Additionally, If that doesn't work then it could always modify the lesson in a way the student could get a better meaning of it. In the article the author states, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The computer is able modify the lesson so the student. maybe even the whole class, could be sable to get a better under standing of the subject at hand. Also the author states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal""

Using this sort of software in schools would do wonders not only for the edicational system but bussniess, the entertanment industry, and even the medical industry. It's fantastic to live in one of the most innovative and technologicly advanced periods of our time and because of things like this, the future only seems brighter. ",4,7,0.9038282632827759
b75fe1c,"The technology to read emotional expressions of students would be valuable because it could help consulors with their jobs. The reason why is because the computer can read emotiaonal expressions of students so the consulors can use the techology to thier advange. As the text says Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and also 6 percent fearful. Imagine having a consulor having that type of tech in their hands. Their would be less fights less sucdial tenions and aslo less bullying.

The technology could also make alot of students smile. As the text states you can conduct an experiment by going to the bathroom and raise your lips at the conroners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slighty to produce wrinkling at the croners of your eyes. And also by holding that raise the outers parts of your cheek up towrad your eyes. They say doing all those faces and experiments can make a person happy just by trying it. Also putting a happy face on your face could infunces others to try the same thing and get the same resluts.

Also if a techaer wanted to prove that the emotional expression technology is vaulable they could set up a way to let the students use and play with the tech. That would let student exprence and see how the technology works and function so that in the future they would know how to use it to. This information can also take technology and others courses to a different level. The reason why is becuase if students learn how to take contorl of this technology they can try to forge it into their own work of art and make it better than before. as the text says your home PC cant handle the complex alogrithms used to decode mona lisa's smile but we can write down simple instructions that encode different emotions. That states there to me that if students get thier hands this type of tech they could alter the world solve problems in a insict or a heart beat and even help bring bullying to a end. Students may think letting the system read their emations is a bad thing or might them feel uncomfortbale but it shouldn't. It's to help them and the teacher have a better relationship and aslo solve problems faster.",3,7,0.8425930738449097
b7a0fc8,"Have you even heard of a Facial Action Coding System? Just making faces they say can reveal so much about the science of emotions. The way I see it is the system has to be Realiable,Accurate, and most importanly Easy to use. Which the system proves it can be a vey vauable system in our society today.

The Facial Action Coding Sysem needs to be reliable if not it may have many malfunctions. Which can be a problem if Dr. Paul Eckman the creator of the software is trying to get his idea out there. In order to run a good bussiness you have to have product that can last when that happens so does your company. In the passage is says ""Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at develpoing better ways for humans ans computers to communicate,"" which happens to be The Facial Action Coding System. That seems to be working although I dont know about what the future hold this product seems like it will do use some good in the future or even know.

Accuratey is very important and was one of my biggest concertains about the Facial Action Coding System. I n the passage it says that ""The software that has been develpoed to improve the accuracy in perceving the emotions of other."" I dont think they are lying just so people could start using their software. Why, because in order for the industries to get the software they are expecting for it to be perfect. So if the company dosen't want to have a bad reputation they are making sure what they are doing is 100% accurate so people can use it. Which it say that in the article that it is so I totally agree that ""The Facial Action Coding System"" is accurate and is something I would use.

So is The Facial Action Coding System easy to use the answer is yes. In the passage the author talks how ""the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" which then classifies six basic emotion happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. So its not like its this long process that takes over twenty-four hours all you have to do is get you face scanned and they tell you your emotions. Not only that but it's also associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. I'm not saying that they can tell you how your feel, but thats what the software is designed to do. This software can be a fun and easy way to find out what other people's emotions are if you wanna know or they dont want to tell you.

So in conclusion I think that ""The Facial Action Coding"" is valuable software that many people should be able to use. Even if people thing that it dosen't work they should at least try it out first. This type of software can be used for many types of things like for science. so as the years go on it should countuine to be improved.

Many students are not happy with spending the day in school.

Teachers all over the country are collaborating to find things that intrest students.

Technology is hitting almost every school currently and it is bring kids to school more eager to learn.

Now, there is a computer software system created by Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe that can detect someones emotions.

This program detects a persons emotions by looking at how the muscles work.

An example of this progam is when the author describes Mona Lisa and says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"".

Technology should be used to read the emotional expressions of students during class becasue it will help teachers find ways to make education exciting for students.

Although sometimes people can read someones emotions, it is not possible every time.

A student could act like they are enjoying school when they are really not.

in some cases, students may not be sad because they are at school but becasue something is happeing to them outside of school.

In paragraph eight, the author says ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes .

But in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius.""

This is an example of how sometimes people can not read someones emotions.

Also, the program would allow a teacher to change his or her lesson plans due to how students enjoy the teaching style.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or board,

Dr Huang predicts.

Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.""

Many students do not use words to express how they feel about something so this is a way to find out if they enjoy the teaching style or not.

If schools are able to get technology that detects emotions, it will help with how they need to organize the day and how to make it more fun for students to learn.

This will lead to an increase in passing and graduation rates.

Reading a student using technology can go many different ways you may get the right answer or you may get the wrong answer,but you can not calculate how a student feel based on a computer and facial muscles. Someone can feel angry and depressed and the computer can read them wrong. You dont have to use technology for everything you can do other things such as ask the person how they feel or look at their facial expression instead of hooking them up to technology in paragraph 5 it says ""you can tell how a friend feel simply by the look on their face"".

This creation may work on some people but not all,in paragraph 5 it says""in fact,we humans perform this same impressive calculation everyday"" even though it calculate all face expressions do not mean that person is feeling that way, a person can be mad for a few minutes or for a act then the computer will say overall that you are angry but you are really happy.

b7e84c0,"Can computers really tell your emotions? Dr.huang is the facial expression emotion observer. Caculating your emotions is like caculating in math.So computers might do this but you can code it to make it work.

It all begins when a computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face. And all 44 of the major muscles in the face must move. Dr,Huang relies on the work of psychologist. Like Dr,Paul eckman creator of FACS (facial action coding system). This is what helped find the emotions of the mona lisa. Eckman has a classified six basic emotions -happy,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness. Then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles. Also using video imagery the new emotions-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of mona lisa.

Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithmus used to decode mona lisa smile. But there are simple instructions to encode different emotions. The muscles you are encoding are called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows feet around your eyes. If you have a false smile your mouth is stretched side ways.

b835460,"There's a new software, the Facial Action Coding System, and has promising applications for a variety of industries. It can be able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. I think the use of this technology that reads the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can help teachers know how students are really feeling, not by how they pretend to feel. Students can fake emotions by fake smiling when they're down or students can look sad, but be alright and just not be smiling.

The text states ""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, with all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of the Facial Action Coding System. Eckman has classified six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. They are associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" So the system has most of the emotions that are used in the everday life. When your muscles move it helps determine your emotion a little better. Some examples, are your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised and your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger.

Secondly, the facial expressions for each emotion are broad and you can see mixed emotions. In the text it said ""There's universal emotions even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions

(like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movement-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. "" When a person is sad and mad, the video imagery can help figure that out. You may not know why they're mad and sad, but you know how they are feeling and something is going on. Then, maybe a teacher can help the student let their emotions out and open to them on why they're feeling different emotions and what's going to cause them to be the way they are.

In addition, in the text it talked about how humans can calculate other people's expression everyday like being able to tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face, but we could have some trouble if their face is worry and other people think they're just tired. In the text, it stated :Dr Huang ovserves that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code"". So even back then artists could draw people with perfect muscles showing their true emotions like da Vinci with Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to your face to show how much the computer can do. It truly is amazing because technology is so advanced, but this technology you could really get a good use out of it for students in their classrooms, mostly for kids who are quiet and just keep to themselves. The text also stated, ""for example if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" It's very helpful for when it shows a student is puzzled on a certain material that is being taught and it can notify the teacher. If the student was shy to ask questions in front of everyone or if they were embarassed to say anything, the teacher woud know and would be able to help the student individually.

Furthermore, the article talked about how moving your muscles helps express your emotions, which is how the Coding system is able to catch onto how you're feeling and if you're hiding your emotions. Examples from the text are, there is an indicator that indicated the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. According to the Facial Feeback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only exresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" When faking smiling people can detect it by the way your mouth looks. It's better to just show your true emotions because there may be many people who can tell your true emotions and when you have the technology in classrooms, teachers will be able to tell your mood.

In conclusion, I think the use of the technology that reads the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valueable. There are many reasons on how it helps and how it works which are several stated above. It's truly amazing techonology and is very advanced and can detect every little thing, like when faking an emotion or having multiple emotions.

In the classroom, students tend to let their minds to drift off and sometimes they get confused but they're to shy to say anything.

The Facial Action Coding System, is a different kind of computer. It determines your emotion which makes it different from the rest. This techonolgy plays a benefical addition to the classroom.

Students will often start to feel boredom or confusion and the facial recognition system will be able to pick up on those emotions. With this information given to teachers, they can change their lesson to make it more meaningful to those students who feel emotions like boredom or confusion. There are many possibilities with this technology when it comes to understanding how students truly feel through out the school day.

The Facial Action Coding System uses a serious of percents to show how a person is feeling. For example, the famous ""Mona Lisa"" painting displays eighty-three percent of happiness, nine percent of disgust, six percent of fear, and two percent of anger(D'Alto, Nick). If this technology is applied to students, then teachers can finally understand how each and every student feels during their class period. Teachers would also be able to recognize if someone may be overly sad or angry. This could enable students to receive help faster from a counselor or parent if they are depressed or anger over something. Understanding is a student is depressed with this new technology could save so many lives due to the fact that teen suicide rates are higher now than they ever have been.

With the new rise of facial recognition software, it can be used in the classroom to help teachers identify how students are really feeling in their classroom. The system could be used to determine if a lesson is confusing or boring a student, which helps the teacher know how they could change up their lesson plan.

The fact that I live in a time where computers could calculate my mood and or my emotions is nothing short of amazing. But, this coding system doesnt benefit the consumer at all. In paragraph six, D'Alto gives an example of a computer analyzing your mood as you come across an ad. So, if you come across happy or smiling the computer will continue to display like minded ads but, if your computer sees that you are frowing upon seeing the ad it will direct you to different ads. Now this is great for the compant who sells whatever is in the ad, they get to literally profit by this technology. But what does it do for the one viewing ads? Nothing.

Another example given in paragaph six is in a classroom setting. Dr. Haing states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". I'm not saying that this technology cannot do what it claims but what it does is utterly uneeded in a classroom setting. If a student is becoming confused about a certain topic they should raise their hand and ask a teacher (even online run courses always ave a teacher there to supervise). They should seek out a teacher guidance because, at least in my school district. cirriculum cannot be altered.

My district is made up of is five different highschools. All five teach the same exact math, english, and science curriculum. So, the computer would not even be permitted to change my lesson even if I was confused. So whats so helpful about a notification appearing on my screen saying thay I am about 63% confused? the answer is simply, its not.

In conclusion, although this software sounds very talented in what it is capable of achieving, is not useful in the classroom. This specific technology would quite honeslty serve me and my fellow classmates no use at all. What this software can do is what almost any human can achieve with sight and cognitive skills.

If that is the only way to recognize a person's true feeling then one might as well use their own eyes. Of course, our eyes are not always inept to specific details, which a computer will help advance, but if recognizing a one's emotions in the classroom is important, one should just learn the specifics of reading emotions to surely understand what a student is feeling.

If one's emotions in the class room are plainly obvious to a computer, then they should be easily recognizable by the teacher. The passage states, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even thorugh individuals ofter show varying degrees of expressions."" With that in mind, students should show a clear expression, such as when one is bored or confused, that is recognizeable to everyone around them, including the teacher, making the the Facial Action Coding System an irrelevance.

The Facial Action Coding system may also be flawed when recognizing emotionaless expressions. When analyzing a person's facial expression, ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Which means that the computer will not be able to read a person's emotions if they hold a straight face. In this case, the recognization ablilities of a computer is unnecessary, for in order to recognize that individual's emotions, another person must know how that individual expresses their emotions such as their actions or words. However, the passage states that ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" In other words, the Facial Action Coding System is helpful when our eyes fail to decifer a stranger's emotions. On the contrary, in a classroom, a teacher should gradually and instincively, learn to recognize the emotions of his or her students without the use of a computer.

Recognizing a student's emotions cannot be solved due to the development of facial recognition systems, such as the Facial Action Coding System. In order to read a student's emotion, it is necessary to understand the student's personal expressions or actions that come from certain emotions. Although a computer can recognize these expressions, it cannot not always be useful if one's expression contradicts the normal facial expression, or an expression is not even shown on their face. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to use a computer to recognize a person's emotions, for it takes a person to know a person, even without a computer. ",4,7,0.8641188144683838

The FACS could help the teacher know that if the students are getting to know the matriale at handed.The FACS uses a 3-D computermodle of the face, and all 44 major muscles that shows if the person is mad, happy, sad, etc. Just like in real lifea person can ditected if their friend is mad, happy, sad, etc the FACS shows the facial expersion of the person so we can esaly see if the person is mad, happy , sad, etc. The aguments that could be said that the FACS is inavasion of prificy, or that we don't need a machine to tellif a person is mad, hapy, sad, etc.

""FACS"" stands for Facial Action Coding Systems. It makes a "" 3-D computer model of your face."" In oder for this to work "" all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of ""FACS"". He has been able to ""classify six basic emotions such as happiness, sadness, suprise, anger, disgust, and fear."" Then he sees which muscles moves with each one and associates this with each emotion. For example "" when you move your 'frontalis par lateralis' muscle (above your eyes) it raises your eyebrows when you're suprised."" Also if "" your 'orbicularis oris' (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.""

How is this used in computers? It is used in computer when it reconizes which muscles move to make that facial expression. They say "" Imagine if your computer could reconize when your happy or sad."" For example "" if you smiled when a web ad appears on your screen, then a similar ad might appear next time. But if you frown, then the next time the ad will be different."" What if a ""classroom computer could reconize when a kid is becoming confused or bored, then they could modifiy the lesson, like a effective human instrutor.""

In conclusion ""FACS"" could help us understand emotions better. It could help improve kids grades in school by changing the lesson when they get confused or bored. It could help us understand early are work where it is a portrait. When could find out the emotion of the painting and maybe if the person was happy, sad, in fear, anger, or even disgusted.

ba76cb5,"I do not think that the new software would be of any use. Yes it is a good idea. But in the artical it gives us an example of if a student is confused or if a student looks mad or angry, the new software would explain the steps over until the student understands. The way I see it for example a student is working on a problem and the see something unusal in the problem and makes a confused face for a least a second the prgram would explain it to them. The student knows how to do the problem and knows how to solve it already but the program brought up step to exaplain it anyway. It would be useless the student could have soveld it already and would have been to the next problem but the Facial Action Coding System got in the students way just to show them how to do something they already know.

In the artical it also tells us to look in a minor or at a friend and make a ""smiling face"". The friend would see that you are happy yes, but we were told to make that face we had no desire to make that face happy or not, we just made the face, it was a forced smile. In the artical also it says that the computer program would be able to tell a force smile from a genuingly happy smile which what I just explaind that a smile is easy to manipulate. The program could be taking in false information and the program itself would not even know it.

In the artical it also exaplains that ads. That if a ad were to pop up and you would smile the prgram would show another ad just like the previous one and visvursa. The real question is have you ever ever seen a ad so many times that you become angry or frustrated and you smile because the ""Skip ad"" timer is getting closer and closer to zero the ""FAC"" would miss-understand your face and bring another ad just like that one. With this program I see very many problems that would not be able to be avoided.

""The new emotion-recognition software tracks facial movements!"" Oh great but world class actors and actresses and pull the fake emotions off like no other. Some people dont show emotion and sometimes can be happy but no show it. with all these muscles in your face it could also mean that the face tracker would miss lead the face expressions. You as might as well have a dog look at you and be able to tell if your happy or not, becuase they are much better at reading face expressions.

It is a really good idea but it can be easily manipulated and also be in the way of varius things.

The matchine are exact and they are able to detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. This new technology is the latest innovation from Prof. Eckman, creator of FACS has classified six basic emations. They are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All of the emotions associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". The software read people's face and tell what is happening to them. Dr. Huang observes that,""The facial expressions for each emotions are universal"". For example, our frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises our eyebrows when we are surprised.

Using a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Imagine a computer knows when we are happy or sad. Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructors. sometimes, it is hard for the teachers to guess the students. Human may know 50% of what they need acording to face emtions but the Face Action Coding System might know about 90% of human,s emotions by scanning their faces.

bacd8f3,"In this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about how the author describes new technology called the Facial Action Coding System which identifys the human emotions. This technology shouldn't read the students' facial expression. It shouln't read a students facial expressions because first off there's no reason to do it at a school especially. Second of all there's more other emotions than happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness to tell of your face or mood. And the last reason is there's other new technology that can copy the 3-D face plus it could be dangerous.

First off, there's no reason to do it in a school. Mainly because at a school you learn about different subjects like math, english, science, etc. I do not think this is some ""lab experiment"" either. Although the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, and has all the 44 major muscles in the model to move like the human muscles. Do we really need all that just to tell what your facial expression is saying.

Second of all there's other emotions than happiness,surprised, anger, fear, and sadness. Also there is lots of names on your face of what shows the emotion you are in. Orbicularis oris tightens your lip which shows anger, the zygomatic major lifts up the corner of your mouths,oculi pars palpabraeus make the crow feet, the zygomatic major is having your mouth stretched sideways while the risorius is a different muscle. According to the article you have to make those ""fake smile"" that has all those to test your facial expression.

The last reason is because there's new studies that basically copies your facial expression or movents to a thing on the IPhone X called the Animoji. Animoji is basically an emoji coming to life and it can talk, copy your facial expression , and if you move your head around it'll move it's head around. Plus it's also a 3-D model as well. If the Animoji see's that your eyebrows are up or down, the corner of your mouth is lifted, or that your eyes are squinted it will copy every movement. Its dangerous beacuse apparently once it captures your face, basically the government or polices will know where to find you or how you look like all because of that.

Those are my reasons why this technology should not be used on students is because first off there is no reason to do it at a school, second of all there's other facial expressions other than happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and my last reason is because there's new studies and it could be dangerous fo student.

Humans emotions can be made to seem one way but not be right at all just because a person is smiling doesn't make them happy or mean they are they could deep down be mad.

bb7ec27,"In this article of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it talks about how a facial recognition software can detect your mood. It is brough up in paragraph six that this software should be introduced into classrooms. Classrooms are already getting technologically advanced and are gaining more expenses from this as well. Adding Facial Action Coding Systems to students' computers will just add unwanted price increases, pointless space takeup, and more complexity to computers in our classrooms.

Adding this Facial Action Coding System (FACS) will just add on to the expenses that schools are already putting into place just to add on to the technology that people are trying to push into schools. If a school of lower income tries pushing this system, taxes and school payments will be greatly increased on parents that might not even want this system at all. Although richer schools may be able to afford this software, it will definitely take money away from sections of the school that actually might need attention such as athletics or even music and art classes. Money saved from not buying a software that is just a want and not a need can fork money over to parts of schools that actually need the money. This software is not a necessity and if bought, can take away money from areas that need attention. Not only is the price not needed to be added to, but this software may not even help students in the classroom.

Students in schools with enough money to give students their own laptops usually have used a lot of money on these already expensive devices. Laptops in schools are most usually used to help students who are sick at home to stay connected to their teachers to get assignments. Other uses for the laptops range from eliminating paper and also researching. The FACS software just adds another layer of complexity to the laptops. In paragraph six, the author talks about how the software can see your reaction to ads on screens and adjust new ads to this facial expression. Not only can you be frowning for other reasons than your computer, but if you are doing schoolwork, why does it matter if you are mad or happy? Laptops are to get work done and get through school to help you research and understand topics more. Laptops are not for fun but are tools to help you succeed in school by helping you learn topics applied by the teachers. This software could be extremely helpful at home, but at school it just makes the laptops more complex than they need to be.

If a laptop is being used in school, it is being used as a tool to eliminate paper and help teachers connect to students on a higher level. These laptops are already complex enough to have several tabs at once, documents eliminating paper usage, and also have online textbooks. Some students who are not very educated in technology may see some information gathered and used by laptops to seem very confusing and maybe even frightening. Adding this FACS to laptops at schools will just change how students are seeing their laptops and can be switched around by students making faces at it. If a student is very sad and looks at the computer, it may make things happier and more colorful, but what happens when somebody is very happy? Will the computer turn dark and very bland to make them sad? The software will add another layer to these already complex devices that is not needed. The software may be a want in the eyes of people trying to make school more enjoyable, but this software is merely useless in connection to learning experience. Even with all of these negatives, there are some positives in that some genuinely sad individuals using this software can be cheered up and will actually begin to pay attention to their screens. This software has many negatives but at the same time might actually be used for good in schools that can afford it and still have money left over.

All in all, this software may be helpful to those outside of classrooms, but in reality it may be too expensive for some to implement into these already expensive devices. FACS at its worst will be a price increase, an unneeded software, and a system that will add complexity to these laptops. But, FACS at its best can greatly increase moods of poeple who have acquired this software in hopes of it increasing moods and helping students focus. This software should be relatively unexpensive which will give schools the ability to talk to families about implementing this software into laptops to help students learn. If a school can afford this software and it is approved by families, this definitely can help students focus unless this is too expensive for schools but is added anyways. To conclude, this software is somewhat useless in a way but it is completely up to the school corporation and the families of the school to decided if this should be implemented into our daily lives.

bb9e309,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author Nick D'Alto presents information regarding Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a computer which that can sense people's emotions. D'Alto lists out many of the functions of FACS, and effectively uses these functions to show that this technology can be valuable in a classroom setting.

One direct mention of FACS' benefit in the classroom is mentioned in paragraph 6. The author writes, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a stuedent is becoming confused or bored."" This allows teachers to recognize these emotions more clearly, and switch the topic to somethng more interesting, in which the students will be more likely to pay attention. As a result, class focus will increase as well as students' grades. Thus, one can see that FACS can help increase the productivity in a classroom.

Another benefit of FACS is mentioned later in the text. D'Alto mentions how FACS can help people reproduce and replicate certain emotions: he had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage."" Through studying the methods of FACS, people can learn to replicate emotions. This can prove to be helpful in classroom setting, because as mentioned in the text, ""empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" When one students see his friend feeling down, he can help his friend cope by empathizing with him. Having FACS can allow students to practice and experience the relationship between facial muscles and emotions. As a result, this will foster positivity in the classroom.

Furthermore, through FACS, teachers can often tell whether a student is lying or not. The article mentioned how FACS can be used to tell if someone is falsely characterizing themself: ""faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to sport when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" These implications can also be demonstrated in the classroom, when a student is being untruthful about something. The teacher can use FACS to identify the emotions of the students, and make sure he gets a fair punishment.

Overall, FACS is a great tool with a wide variety of applications, including in the classroom. Although it is not a viable option in classrooms right now, it may become an important technology for society in the future.",4,7,0.8299757242202759

By weighting the different units, the software can identified by the using mixed emotions. Each emotion is compared against neutral face, in other words no expression shown.

A kind of basic emotions is happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your above your eyes muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your around you mouth muscle tightens your lips to show anger. It meanspeople can't lied their emotions because people feel something emotions they face or body muscle something to change; so we can found what they feel.

People emotions can't shows percentages, that mean that emotions is not real. Emotions is not math or science. We feel something emotions become the face is some science because movement some muscle or become to change something body or face. But exactly emotions is feeling; so emotions is psychology. So people do lied looks like weird active or they can't see the eyes; something this situations.

Now people do lied thier emotions. For example, your unhappy but front of people you smile so people feel ""You are so happy"" something like that.

We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Some people do practice about for they how to show their face.

False smile is so sad fact, but people really general use this way. One reason, somethimes people doesn't want to talk about their feeling. Other reason is we doing smile, we can shows ""I am smiled person."". It means you can bring positive an impressive. General people thought first impressive is important.

Emotion is shows how i feel. So sometimes we need to false emotions. But i thought if you use everyday use false emotions, you get a disease in your mind.

The way the software can do this is by seeing how the muscles in your face move. This would be very useful in a class room setting, lets see why.

In the painting of the Mona Lisa the software said she was 83 percent happy, this is judged by her eyes and the form of her smile. The software would help in a class room setting by letting the teacher know that the students are bored or not paying attention. This could also allow the teacher to get those students who aren't paying attention involved. The value of this is unmatchable and could help in a multitude of ways.

The way the software works is by seeing how each individual muscle moves and where it moves too. For example if you move your lips up and make your eyes squint the software will reconigize a smile, which would indicate happiness. A normal at home PC could not run this software, although the researchers are trying to make it a more condensed process.

So the software could be helpful inside of a classroom setting and could help keep students on task and allow teacher to know when the students are not on task.

For example the author states ''A classroom computer could recognize when a studeny is becoming confused or bored,''Dr Huang predicts.''Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor''(Making Mona Lisan smile).

This new system is also really smart in detecting oneself emotions for example,the author also states that''But in a false smile,the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie;these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ''smiling''politician or celebrity isn't being truthful''(Making Mona lisa Smile).

This is important because this new technology system can help a lot with kids education.

Sometimes kids are afraid of asking their teachers for help because they feel embarrased but with this new technology system it will actually make students feel not afraid or embarrased.

Students are actually going to get help without having to ask a teacher because the Facial Action Coding System will be able to recognize if a student is confused or bored and then it's going to come in with help.

Also this new system can help teachers know how students are feeling towards a subject and how they are doing on a certain subject. The new system will make it easier for teachers and will also save them a huge time rather than asking or doing tests to show results on how well they know the lesson.

This matters because I personally think this new system will make a huge difference because I'm one of those kikds that feel afraid or embarred to ask a teacher for help.

This will help alot with students education by helping them with what they need help and by making them feel more secure.  ",3,7,0.8934655785560608
bd0e1a1,"Have you ever gotten bored during a lecture or lesson at school? Do some classes just seem like they don't fit you, or that you will never be very good at some subjects? Well this could be because of the way you are being taught, whether by a computer program or a teacher. What if a computer could detect when you are not understanding part of a lesson? What if it could alter the lesson, or repeat specific parts so that you know what is being taught? Well that's what Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe have designed; a computer program that can change and adapt to your needs in school when you are bored or confused.

The computer starts by constructing a 3-D model of the face. Movement of one or more of the major 44 facial muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Huang then uses the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman. Eckman created FACS, which is an acronym for Facial Action Coding System. He classified six main emotions that humans experience, and connected each of them with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

Using video imagery the emotion-recognition software, that Dr. Huang has designed, can track your facial movements and detect your emotions. Dr. Huang believes that this software could be extremely useful in a classroom. ""The classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

But what would be better about an emotion-detecting computer than a great teacher? Well, the computer has the ability to tell the students' emotions to a much higher degree than any other human could. The two could even be used in tandem, with the teacher taking advantage of the information the computer outputs about his or her pupils' emotions. If the software is properly used and designed, it could become a great tool in any school. I think that if teacher's use this tool properly, teaching would be easier, and students would learn and retain more information. All this would inevitably lead to better test scores and higher overall GPA.

It might take many years, but I think that if the technology is perfected and used properly, this could be one of the most amazing innovations for years to come. For a teacher to know what his students are feeling and how he can convey information for them to better understand would change teaching as we know it. The Facial Action Coding System could be revolutionary in the classroom. It could make school more interesting for those that find it boring, or those that find it difficult. It could make harder subjects easier on some students. That is why I think we should use this technology to read students' emotional expressions. ",4,7,0.8275419473648071

Some might say its envasion of privacy but think about it, it can help the teaccher see if the student is understanding something or not. To see if the student is upset and the teacher could help out the student a little more.

The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face which reads all 44 major muscles. "" Eckman has classified six basic emtions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness...accociated each with charateristic movements of the facial muscles."" The computer can read the facial expressions and sort them into differnt emtions. The computer can also classify an emtion even if the person isn't really showing it. "" Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" This shows that even if the person tries to hide their emtion the computer knows the persons emtions. Which could be a good tool for when the teacher doesn't know if the student is feeling well or if the student isn't understanding something.

Even us somtimes can't tell what a friend is feeling because we might not be able to sort their facial expressions out. "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" Sometimes we don't know if the person is feeling fear or happy because they are somewhat smiling, and the computer can tell because of the persons facial muscles. "" Image a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" The comupter can help with how things pop up on the comupter. If an ad pops out and you smile another similar ad might pop up later on. Same thing goes for if you an annoyed face when an ad shows up so that the next time a different type or something different might pop up.

The computer can also notice when a smile is real or if its being forced. "" In a false smile, the mouth is streached sideway using the zygomatic major and a different muscle.""

The muscle that is used when the smile is being forced is one of the major muscles which is why it is easy to know if the smile is real or it's forced. ""These muscle clues are sometimes used to pot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Even without the computer people can see when a person is faking a smile.

To finish off, yes I do think that having these kind of computers at schools would be helpful. For the fact that it can help teachers change some of their lessons so that some students who are confused can understand that lesson. It can also help the teachers to know if a student is having a good or bad day so that they can help that student out so that the student can learn what they have to that day.",4,7,0.8407902121543884
bd2920f,"A new piece of technology, the Facial Action Coding System, has been developed and is helping with the learning the emotions of others. Some may say that this technology should not be used in classrooms because it invades the students' privacy. However, finding the emotions of students in classrooms could help teachers with what kind of lessons to prepare and finding out potemial problems that students had. The ability to read the emotions of students in classrooms could be extremely valuable.

Some may argue that having the emotions of students read in class would be a bad idea. If the school could find out what their students were feeling with a computer program, the students may be unhappy with the idea that their school was observing their feeling. In paragraph 8 of the article, the author states, ""faces don't lie"". If teachers used this technology, they could know the emotions of students even if students tried to hide it. In this way, students could feel as though the school is invading their privacy by finding out emotions that they want to keep hidden. Their emotions can be tied to their thoughts. In most cases, people consider their no one else should be able to know their thoughts and emotions without the person's consent. Some argue that reading the emotions of others will be an invasion of privacy.

Teachers using the knowledge of students' emotions could be helpful in a classroom. If teachers know how students are reacting to different assignments, they could alter the worksheets to make the students more interested and understand what they are learning better. Also, if a computer can understand the emotions of children that are using it, the computer can change the material to aid in the learning. The article states, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and ""it could modify the lesson"". Teachers being able to help students better understand what they are being taught is just one of many benefits to using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms.

The knowledge of students' emotions could be beneficial to schools. If teachers could figure out the emotions of students, they teachers could potentially find and help students that are suffering with problems. The author states, ""faces don't lie"". Knowing what is truely going on with students by using this program could help the teacher recognize if a student is struggling with anxiety or stress. Students with anxiety and stress could potentially have suicidal thoughts or actions. By identifying this problem, teachers could get help for the student and help prevent the death of an innocent life. The article also states, "" moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". The teachers could additionally do exercises with students to reduce their stress levels. The technologies like the Facial Action Coding System could help teachers know about students' anxiety and prevent harm to the students.

Though some say there could be several issues with using technology to read emotions in classrooms, there are many more benefits than issues. The system could modify the learning style to one that suits the individual student and could help teachers learn of problems the student has. Using technologies like the Facial Action Coding System to help read students' emotions could be an important asset for schools.",5,7,0.8315705060958862
bd4a2dd,"In my opinion, I feel like they shouldn't bother to use the technology because what is it going to solve? I think it pointless, because nobody will speak up on how they feel in the classroom infront of everyone in there. It would probably say how they feel out loud, and maybe someone doesnt want to be pointed out. ""You can tell how someone feels by their actions and look on their face"", I don't think they'd need a ""robot"" to understand how someone feels in that exact moment. I think teachers or whoever themselves should go up to that person and have a proivate conversation, some teachers see the facial expressions on some students and wont bother to ask. I feel like the technology would be expensive as well and they would need a lot of them. It would just be a waste of money. Plus, it goes by your facial expressions. I don't believe it would actually tell you how you feel. In the passage it says "" even though individuals show varying degress of expression""(like not smiling as broadly) using video imagrey the new emotion-regognition software tracks these facial movements"" so it's basically saying if someone fakes a smile it would tell them because how 'powerful' the techonolgy is, but a lot of people are really good at faking smiles and frowns.

Also, once the technology tells you how you feel what's going to make it better. How can the ""Mona Lisa demonstration bring a smile to your face by just looking at it"". I don't think it's possible, I personally think it wont solve a person's feelings at all, I think its pointless.

As giving the Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. A example they give us for a happy and sad description is, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. This technology can also occur towards video games also for example , The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-- for video games or video surgery.

bdd54af,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", author Nick D'Alto talks about the Facial Action Coding System, a new technology enabling computers to identify human emotions. In paragraph six he briefly talks about how it could work in a classroom setting and I believe that this would be a great new idea to bring into the school systems.

In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto starts explaining the Facial Action Ciding System by talking about all of it's potential, like how it can recognize even subtle facial movements and how it works will all 44 major muscles in our face. He then talks about all the places where this softwear would be useful like being able to tell if someone , like an important politician, is tellikg the truth or not.

Although he only brings the subject up once, he talks about how in a school setting this softwear would be increadibly uesful to help teach students more by knowing when they are confussed or borded. If teachers had access to infromation like this they would know when a leason is becoming too much for their students and be able to move on or explain it better. I think that this would be one of the most efficient ways to learn properly in school.

Let say a student has been out of it and sudenly realizes he has no idea whats going on during an important leason in his english class, but he doesn't want to say anything to his teacher because he's afraed he'll get in trubble, or maybe he's just to lazy to ask. That student won't have any idea of what to do for the rest of class. If schools had the Facial Action Coding System then the teacher would know right away that the student had not been paying attention and would be able to go back and explain again.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding System would be a great addition to the learning world. Students would never again have to sit through a class and have no idea what was going on because before they got too confused the system would let the teacher know. ",3,7,0.8364762663841248

be0bf59,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", explains how technology created by Prof. Thomas Huang and his colliague Prof. Nicu Sebe have been devolping better ways for humans and coputer to communicate. Almost all people can read someone's emotion through the expression they give even through a fake smile, and some over look this. Say it's chritmas and your parents get you a bag of grape fruits, you probably are going to be unsatisfied or annoyed, angry even. If it was from your parents though your going to put on a show and smile and and probably say things like ""wow, this is awesome"". Faking an expression like this will most definently fool your parents, but with this new technology you would simply be able to know how you child is feeling.

The question is though whether or not the use of this technology would be useful in students classrooms be valuanle. To some teachers it might affect them to the fact students keep falling asleep or not doing homework, and maybe just maybe with this technology you would be able to change your teaching style to create a more fun, interesting time in class. Honestly though It doesn't need to be used in classes. Why would you need to use it in the classroom. People have different emotions everyday, heck every second. Why would you need a device that reads emothions for school. This technology would be much better used in a game or a useful tool for phsycologist. There is no reason for it. If you had it would you use it to change the way a student is feeling probably not.

be203c9,"I believe that use of the Facial Action Coding System could make immediate impacts in a classroom setting. The idea of being able to see someone's inner emotions could show lots of value for teachers in the class. This machine, after being tested in the classroom, could be used to make even more accurate and in-depth machines that could go even deeper. All it takes is it starting off.

There are many benefits to having a machine that is able to accurately find someone's emotions. The applications in the classroom would help make the day for a teacher run smoothly if there was trouble with a student, or if there was something upsetting a student you could use this device. The value of knowing what your students feel could help mold a curriculum that would be the most effective for their learning. Paragraph 6 mentions that classes could have computers that could detect these emotions, and change the way the lesson is and mold it to work for that specific student.

There is no reason that the FACS shouldn't be implemented into classes. The FACS is just a more accurate way of processing and recognizing someone's emotions and feelings. We, as humans, are always performing this calculation every day, as listed in paragraph 5. We cannot tell every emotion in someone's face, as they could be hiding their emotions behind a fake smile, or hiding sorrow or sadness behind a snarl. With the FACS knowing the emotions of a student in class who is struggling could maybe help the student and teacher find a way to stop the struggle. There is nothing wrong with knowing a student's emotions so a teacher can assist them if they are struggling.

This understanding of emotions and the creation of lessons that could help with those emotions could help graduation rates for schools go up, and help the GPA or work ethic of a student to increase. These benefits all could come from knowing students' emotions as long as the FACS is put into a school's classrooms.

Some may be worried that the FACS could be unaccurate and tell wrong emotions, but claims in paragragh 3 state that muscles in your face also dictate what emotion your feeling. These muscles can also indicate whether your smile is real and you are really happy, or if your smile is fake and that your feeling something different. Trained psychologists and others in their respected fields have contributed to the FACS to try and help create accurate assumptions based on the muscle usage in a person's face.

The evolution and effectiveness of the FACS could increase with the help of its use in the classroom, and the readings could become more accurate and more beneficial to the teacher and the student. The FACS could be used in almost anywhere, but I believe that it would have the biggest impact in the classroom. The effect it could have enourmous, and all it would take is one computer software.

The FACS should be put in classroom, not only to further the research needed to help develop the software more, but to help students who may struggle with lessons in class. The FACS's ability to read emotion will benefit student and teacher when the time comes, all it needs is to find its place in the classroom.   ",5,7,0.8669446706771851
be7c6bd,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which allows a computer to identify human emotion through the expressions of one's face. The FACS has decyphered the many different expressions portrayed by the famous Mona Lisa painting, created by Leonardo Da Vinci. But it can be channeled into a much more profitable cause; reading the emotions of students in a classroom. It could allow teachers to see how effective the lesson is on the students and how many students are truly paying attention.

The effectiveness of a lesson is essential to the understanding of a class. If students cannot understand a lesson, frustration sets in and the student begins to give up. With the FACS, however, that sense of frustration could end as quickly as it began. The FACS would allow teachers to monitor the facial expressions of teir students, alowing them to probe the student to ask questions, rather than sit in confusion.

The FACS could also allow teachers to see who is truly paying attention in class. With Dr. Huang's software, teachers could tell how effectively the lesson changed the mood of the students, allowing them to see any signs of mixed emotions or emotionless faces. For example, just like how Mona Lisa's expressions revealed her emotional state in paragraph one, it could do the same for students. Also i paragraph 6, it describes a visual perception of certain Web ads could cause certain emotions, just like a lesson. All these emotions could the be associated with many different moods such as boredom or tiredness. The teacher could then switch to an activity which allows all students to actively pay attention to what is being taught.

Overall, the effectiveness of the Facial Action Coding System could be very beneficial in a classroom environment. It could allow teachers to see the cloud of confusion that hangs over the room of students, enabling them to prod the efforts of the students to ask questions. It also allows teachers to see who is paying attention in class, giving them a sense of how effective the lesson plan is, which could lead them to either continue with the same teachings or switch up the activities done by the class.This could help the grades of many students for the better.",4,7,0.8050786256790161

What methods do they use to make this happen and possbile? Dr. Eckman classified the six basics motions-happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness but he associated each characteristics with the movements of the facial muscles. For example, "" your frontails pairs lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"". According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help to produce them. This progrma can not only drescribe your emotions, it also shows when you ae hidding you emotion and when you do a fake smile. For example,"" intructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular actions units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""

The Reason using tehnology to read students emotional expressions is valuable is because better way of getting close and personal with people, the improved way of helping people with their problems, and just by looking at a picture or word, we can make ourselfs feel that emotion. Those three exaples are ways that this system is valuable.

One reason the system is valuable is because it is a better way of getting to know people. In the story, the author explains how Mona Lisa has different emotions in the famous picture that was made from Leonardo de Vinci. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent dearful, and 2 percent angry"". Thinking the only way possible to find out is to ask Leonardo. Well, there is a ""new software system has been developed that improves acuracy in perceiving the emotions of others"". This quote explains how through one scan on the computer, we can find out how they are feeling. This software system is a better way of getting to know eachother, but also it is a better way of helping people through their problems.

Also, a reason this system is valuable is because it is i proved system to help us help other people through their problems. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeoing simply by the look on her face."" That quote explains how facial expressions help. People can only tell if their happy, sad, mad, etc. Just mainly the basics. But with this system, you can tell how they are really feeling and be very specific. Just by raising your eyebrows, it'll tell you are curious. Or just by squinting your eyes when your smiling, the system can tell you are happy. For a computer, that is pretty impressive. Not only you can tell their problems, but it explains how looking at different emotions make you feel the same as them.

One last reason this system is valuable is because by us just looking at picture or a word, we can make ourselfs feel that emotion. ""Empthy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"". That quote explains how just by looking at a person, screem, picture, etc. we can feel the same exact emotion just because how normal and easy it is these days.

Technolgy has changed many ways over the passed years. Theere was internet coming out, then touch screen, many websites and video calling apps, etc. But now all the way to the fact we can express and know eachothers emotions by just one scan on the computer. A better way of getting close and personal with people, the improved way of helping people with their problems, and just by looking at a picture or word, we can make ourselfs feel that emotion is the reason using technology is valuable.

Today Thomas Huang has now made an invention. Huang has came up with a technology called Facial Action Coding System which is where computers can caculate up the real emotions of a student or person. Studies show that this technology system can read all your emotions you're feeling. It can tell if you're sad,happy,angry and lots more of emotions. Huang states in the text that they tell your emotions by the muscles on your face.

Huang also goes on saying that he can pin point out emotins on kids in school. In my defence I dont this this would work accuratley. Not only do i think it would work. Many of teacher would not want to get out that device in the middle of class just to see your kids emotions. Many of kids fake smile or act like they are happy when really they are not. Studies show that they are identified by the muscles but you could easlily get told to smile which changed your muscles which changed the game.

Many of student come to school depressed or upset. Many of teacher do not know if they are really happy or not. This technology I feel would not be valuable because maybe the student do not want people to know there emotions. Emotions should be kept private and with this technology it would be open to everyone in a classroom.

Overall I feel like this would not benifit anything. I also feel like this would not be valuable to students in classrooms. Therefore This technology may help on paints. One example is the Mona Lisa but not on humans because this could lead to not there real emotions.      ",3,7,0.8520439863204956
bf738fe,"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems could be very useful. There are several reasons for this. First of all there are several industries ot can be used in. Secondly it could help students get a better education. The last reason is that it could make advertisements more relevant. However there are also drawbacks to using a computer software to read people's emotions.

Several industries would benefit from this software. As the article mentions artists are required to be able to recognize the facial expressions of the people they are painting or drawing. These expressions are critical to conveying the correct emotions, so clearly the art industry could benefit from the use of Facial Action Coding Systems. Another way industy that this software could be used in is politics. The article talks about how the software can recognize the difference between a fake smile and a real smile. This could be useful when analyzing political figures as well as celebrities. A possible downside to this is cost effectiveness. The question of is the cost really worth it whenever there are already people in the world that can do the same thing.

Another useful aspect of the Facial Action Coding System is it's use in schools. In the article Dr. Huang, the co-developer of the system, says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, likean effective human instructor."" This could be the most useful aspect of the software, because not everyone learns in the same way. If your computer could recognize when you were getting bored or confused and then fix the problem it would make learning much easier for a lot of people. It would also allow students to move at their own pace as not everyone works at the same speed. A downside to this software is the loss of jobs for teachers as well as the reliance on technology.

The last aspect is that it could make advertisements more relevant. The article states that if you smile when an internet ad appears on your screen, another similar as might follow. However if you frown, the next ad will be different. This is useful both for the consumer and the company. We all know that when an annoying ad pops up it usually gets ignored especially if we've already seen that ad one hundred times. But what if the ad was for something you actually liked then you might go buy it. The only negative about this is that the software won't recognize if you're smiling about the video you just watched or the ad that pops up.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System could possibly be very useful in the future. There are many industries where it could be used, schools could use it to make education more beneficial and it could make advertisements more relevant. However there are also a few issues which should be adressed before it could be used in mainstream businesses and schools. ",5,7,0.8318131566047668

For example in paragraph six it states,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could notify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This can give advantages to teachers and students because student might be afraid to ask what the lesson was about and not ask when the software can also help.

To explain the machine , it is a computer the constructs a 3-D computer model of a face. It reconizes all 44 major muscles in a face of a model and must move like human muscles. It roconizes the action unit of a more muscles in a face. the machine was created by DR. Paul who created the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) and Dr. Huang. It basically tracks and understands differnt empotions by tracking and understanding facial expressions, since people le understand how a person feels based on physical expressions of the face. The computer is then able to under stand a persons emotion.

This level of technology is advense, but what would happen if this kind of computer was mobile and was used in a school, by teachers to know what emotions a student was feeling, to and they used as if it were a lie detector. Well there are pros for the teachers, like if a student was lieing to them about an assignment or a use it to understand what happened in their class by simply scanning the students and use the information they have to esstimate an answer. It would be convenient for the teacher or even a priciple to figure out what the student is feeling. Usually a teacher would ask the student about what happened to the student. They would use the computer if they don`t care and only want the truth from the student as a positive answer they would understand. They computer would most likely idintify someone who is lying and get punishment. It could also help a teacher understand if the student is under stress and would be able to do something before the student does something that would their greatest mistake they could end up taking. Other reasons is being able to find out why a student is queit and not talking to everyone that are his or her friends. They would even be able to find out secrets that a student is keeping from them, if it`s good or bad the teacher would simply be able to figure out what it is.

With every pro there is a con that exist, for one how would the computer be able to be mobile, the computer that can calulate emotions would be huge and bulky to carry aroung. Plus there arew few apps that can tell emotions ,even if they have a few mistakes. Besides that it would be consider an invasion of privacy, since most people would want to keep something a secret, like love. It would even something that students would try to get away from it either try to keep it a truth and really saying that you did an assignment or risk it all and get caught.

From all this information having aving a computer that teel emotions would have it`s ups and down,some being able to find some who has lied and catch them and even helping someone who have problems with themselves or at home. The con is that people would try to avoid it, or if they had to understand something they could just ask the student and have a conversation with them about whats wrong ang why. Having an emotion computer have some percs, but would be use on rare occasions. ",3,7,0.8126224279403687
c032847,"I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuble because in paragraph 6 it talks about if you smile when a Web ad appears on the screen, a similar ad might follow . But if you frown the next ad will be differnt. The story talks about how your face expressions can say what emotion your feeling. For example if you raise your lips at the corners of your mouth , then squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes , holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes , it gives the looks that your happy because it all depends in your musccular actions . The computer can also tell when your faking a smile and when its real . Also in paragragh 8 its says that to an expert, faces dont lie, because the muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smile is not true. I think the technology to read minds is valuable because they tested it and they aprove that it is true that your face expresions show your emotions. ",2,7,0.8484598994255066

They will make a certain facial expressin such ass raising there eyes macking a weird light smile or smurk. These signs of facial reaction or movement of the face will be able to tell if somone is lieing or telling the truth.

The author gives us examplse of how to tell these claims. He gives us the distinked signs to look for to back the argument. Such as he tells us the facial expresions are very universal. Meanig that not just one person can have that facial expresion in the world. Also tells us how the new technolgy tracks the facil movements in somones face when they are showing emotions or trying to find them.

So this artical is mainly about a new technolgy using sciance to tell somones emotions by there facil expresion. The new tech tracks the movemnt in somones face. say if they talk an are telling a lie itll track your expresion an movment to determain if you are telling the trooth. But this goes off of other peoples stuff to becuase these facial expresions are universal meaning not just one person in the world has just this facial expression when they lie are being asked a qeustion or just talking. So the new tech tracks the movment of your face gestures and bases off of othere poeple who told the truth an who lied meaning they based the new facial expresions off a lairs an people who told the truth facial expresions an based em off of witch ever side your expressions leaned towards.",1,7,0.718150794506073

Then the computer could modify the lesson like an effective human instuctor. or when you get on anybody it could see your emotion and give you something that woukld help with it. it could make video games better and in paragraph 6 it says that

""most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication so computers need to understand that to"".

Then again some people would think that its weird to have a computer watching your face 24/7. ,aybe it could turn into a robot and take over the world. we would never know but if they did come out with the facial action coding system it would be kinda cool to have videos and stuff to cheer you up if your sad if your in a good mood could send you something to make you laugh. Even if your just doing homework and it could tell that your upset or confused or just bugged out by the problem it could help you without even asking fo9r help it would help you out right away i think thats coool cause alot of kids need help on stuff like that and for teachers they cant help alot of students with work. So before the teacher even gets to them the computer could be helping them alreadfy its like a teaher thats already there and lord knows every student wants that extra help to pass.

The process begin when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major mucles in the model must move like humans muscles. movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions that are happiness, surprise, anger, disguits, fear and sadness -and then associated each whit characteristic movements os the facial muscles. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, Dr. Huang thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly), The software can even identify mixed emotions, each expression is compared against a natural face showing no emotions. the monal lisa demostration is really intendet to bring a smile to your face. Imagine making a computer that know when you are sad or happy it can be good for people. In conclusion this idea is really amazing besause it helps people and almost all the people are confused beacuse they dont know how they feel about something, this computer with the sofware it can be good for school because al students got confiused in something bout someones are shy an they dont want to ask to the teachers to make the aclaration about the thing that they are confiused and it can be better for teachers making more things intesting.",2,7,0.902184009552002
c0b222f,"The technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable, because it could be a way of ineracting with the students a difffrent way, be a new subject in school to study in and make a career out of, and it coule be a learning tool for students.

This technology could be valuable in the class room by teachers interacting with students in a diffrent way then they usually do. Teachers could change thing up instead of doing the same things all time. As the author states in Paragraph 7, ''Raise your lips at the corner of you mouth, then squint you eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes. Does your expression suggest an emotion, can your partner recognize which one.'' This peice of information suggests the interaction with people in the classroom along with your own emotios while being at school learning.

Furthermore, this technology could be a new study in school or possibly something to be able to mager in in college and make it a career. As the author begings to explain, '' The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while also showing you how much the computer can actually do. Imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad.'' This quote from the passage shows what this technology can already do but also intends a possible future advancment, which is when a career, studies, and students come into play.

Finally, this technology could be valuable in the classroom by the students learning more about it or using it as a learning tool. In paragraph 5 the author states that, ''We humans perform this impressive calculation everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a frind is feeling simply by the look on her face, but of course most of us would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried etc. This quote from the passage shows the possible fact of students using this technology as a learning tool for a class like physic while studding how the brain works with emotions.

If we can do it, wouldn't it be neat to see if the FACS can do it also? Technology is so smart in todays world, that the Face Action Coding System would be able to tell if you are making a fake expression or a real one. If classrooms were to invest in this system students would not be forced to use it, it is optional.

I think that it would be amazing to have this system in a classroom. Our computers here at home can't do the or handle the complex algorithms that were used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.

Thats probably how she takes all of her pictures you never know, she could have been feeling sad, mad, fearful, or anything unless you were with her at that time of the painting andd she told you how she was feeling.

In paragraph 1 it also talks about a new technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" that can read humans facial emotions made by Professor Thomas Huang. These are the things that the article talks about thoughout the passage.

The first thing I will talk about is the way students in a classroom can also read the emotions of other students. In the paragragh before paragragh 8 it says that, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" I chose this sentence because it explains how students are able to read other students facial expressions. Another thing is in science class the students performed a lab expierment to see if they can read other students facial expressions. They were able to do this because in paragraph 8 it says that the muscles in your face are called orbicularis oculi.

The second thing is how Professor Thomas Huang managed to be able to create a new technology to read humans facial expresions. In paragragh three it says that,"" when a computer constructs a model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" I chose this sentence because it explains how this new technology works.

c0ff8e8,"Most of us know how far we have reach with modern technology, defitnetly far. Due to this is not that surprising that nowadays computers are able to recognize people's emotions through this new software. Where is technology taking us?

It all starts by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a system that basically makes computers identify the movement of human muscles in the face that show different human emotions. This lets computers know if you are either sad or happy, uninterested or bored, etc. So now what? Computers are being able to comprehend our emotions, interact and even understand us? As crazy as it sounds, it can actually work in a good way.

How can a software on a computer actually benefit us, and indeed work in our way, especially if you are a student? Well, this makes computers able to understand student's feelings towards an assingment. It will indentify students emotions and help them benefit by trying to work with them. As Dr. Huang (1 of the innovators of this software) states on the passage on paragraph 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This could help students by trying to make the work easier for them, making it more interesting, or making it easier by a change of words we'll understand better. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effetive human instructor"". Basically like a teacher, but the ""teacher"" is really the computer that helps you understand the content better by your facial expressions or emotions in regards to the work or assingment you are taking.

In this era where technology is such a big thing, we can expect a lot of things, even computers being able to comprehend our emotions and make something out of it. Whether it is telling us if the Mona Lisa was really happy or not, make us have more interest on an assingment or make a videogame better, all those things add a value to this software which can be a helpful thing in the future.

While many may agrue that the Facial Action Coding System are not valuable, In fact it is. For example, being able to detect how other people are feeling, develope better ways for humans and computers to communicate, and lastly the computers could modify the lessons based on the how the students are feeling.

First, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for detecting how people are feeling. Alto writes, "" Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others"" . This quote shows that when a person is confused on what the other person is feeling , this machine will help someone know exactly how the other peron is feeling.

Second, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Alto writes,"" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate"". This quote shows that this machine is not only detecting facial emotions but it is a great way for humans to comunicate with computers.

Thirdly, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for Modifying the lessons based on how students are feeling. Alto writes,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson"" . This quote shows that the computer could pick up if one of sudents is getting confused , bored ,etc. and it could modify the lesson so that the student will not be confused or bored anymore.

The Facial Action Coding system is valuable to have in a classroom , Although many say its not, These three reasons is why having the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a class room.

Dr. Huang made a technology that can read facial expresstions. it could tell you if you are 94 precent angry and 6 percent happy.

In the Mona Lisa smile it showed she was 82 percent happy, and some other kind of emotions. what if mona did put a smile on her face, because thats how she was thinking, on the outside she looks very happy, but on the inside she can feel other emotions. In paragraph 9 line 4 and 5 says ""puting on a happy face, actually works."" what if you only had to smile just a litle bit to get a result out of the new techology. Not really being happy or sad that day you felt another way.

Lets say you were sad one day and going to get a panting done, when you showed up you looked happy but on the inside you still were still sad. on the outside they can see or show any emotion, when you get throght the walls of pain created by yourslef you are the only one who really knows what is wrong with you. The second paragraph said ""Can we really calculate emotions like math homework...and can a computer reconize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel"". meaning can technology really tell how a person is feeling. or can it tell the right feeling we are having.

In paragraph three it talks about how there are six basic emotions. What if a person did have surpised face but what if that was a thinking face. Or a confussed face. As Dr. Huang states the computer can tell when you are having a bad time with the work or how to do it, and the computer changes. knowing that wont be a problem for the children taking the test, but what if you were talking a test and this just happened. Would your test not count or would it be okay. As another person can read another persons face and think it is bad or good. what if the computer thinks the person is doing something with there face and the person is not showing any emotion but there face. As people we make the mistake to think something is wrong with another, but every thing it fine. Will this technology make the same?

I'm concluding that we should not have this technology until it can really be sure based on the real emotions a person has.

Overall, schools could see a massive change in students moods after introducing this software.

Shcools wouldn't be the only ones to take advatange of this new technonlogy, companys that are trying to market and sell their product could calculate what is liked and disliked based on the emotions analyised after people view their products.

Imagaine always having excatly what you like or excatly what you need pop up in an ad, or suddenly become available at the nearest store. Not only do you get what you need, companys will be able to make more money, helping the economy grow, and hopfully that money makes its way back to you someday.

Aside from schools and marketing, how can this effect everyday life? The articles states that

Making dfferent faces and having different attitudes can revel so much about the science of emotions.

""Hold on! Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions-- like math homework?"" do you think that using a computer to deturmane our feelings is right? To me thats cool, maybe even unbelievable. Is the use of computers,emotions,and muscles the key to feelings.

Many people can't seem to find what feeling mona lisa is showing, sometimes you cant see what emotion your friend is having. Two professors have decided to invent a software which it can detect the feeling of a person or a painting. stated in paragraph 1, "" the software is the lastest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" This shows that the professors are trying to invent and new and improve way to figure out emotions within the human and paintings. They are creating a software for the computers. Also stated in paragraph 3, "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscle."" Not only can the computer detect the feelings, it also makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting.

Everyone has emotions but some you just cant tell how they are feeling, well now you might not have to worry about that i do believe that this software is going to be very valuable to the students, in very many ways. its going to help them with observing the way the looks and creses in the face is. Stated i paragraph 3, "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" There are many emotions but these are the most common. Also stated in paragrapgh 4, "" In a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emmotions."" No matter what the person is feeling. if they feel sad, worried and happy all at once the software can still detect the emotions of this human or painting.

You know that it takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it takes why less muscles. just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling. when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7, "" In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the coners of your mouth."" with just useing a couple of muscles it can add a whole different facial expression. Like if you sqint your eyebrows and then also smile and also close your eyes a little bit I know that i wouldn't be able to tell weather they were happy or angry. just by changing on muscle movement it can change the facial expression. Also stated in paragraph 8, "" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" not only is this cool but its differentuse one other different muscle and people can tell that your smile isnt really and happy smile.

This software is a great idea to help many people just understand the emotion of others with the knowledge of computers, emotions, and muscles they will be able to know how anyone is feeling just by the three main reasons.",3,7,0.7500282526016235
c291598,"The use of this technology called the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to read students' emotional expressions. Not all expressions on a students face can be readable. Some students may have a natural expressions but show it differently. How accurate are these calculations for these expressions really?

In the article it states ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness"" but what about emotions that go further and can be shown or thought to be as a basic expression ? More emotions are linked to the basic emotions if a person is to have guilt but show a face of anger but actually they are sad and cover it. The Facial Action Coding System just reads the expressions but not feelings of the students.

Some students have natural expressions. We have friends that have a natural 'mean mug' but are in reality happy or just calm this system could get it confused with an angry face. In the article it states ""The facial expressions for each emotion are univeral."",meaning there is a wide range of emotions but could this system actually detect the difference between two similar faces of a person that makes the same face alot. In the article it also states

""For,example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle(above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" so for the students who have a natural facial structure it will most likely be harder to detect their actual emotion.

The article starts off by saying ""Shes 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Although the system recognizes these expressions they are not actually reading her thoughts so they do not actually know the feelings of Mona Lisa and just are basing it off her expression. In this article it also states ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)"" but how accurate is this persons face against others they could be showing emotions also.

In conclusion, this is why the system should not be a value to read people expressions. It doesnt have a wide enough range for each person. The system bases it off others neutral faces. People structures are different from one another and have different meanings. The system does not give you actual feelings and just read faces.       ",4,7,0.8344744443893433

The facila expressions for each emotion are Universal observes DR.Huang ""even though individuals often show varyng degrees of espresion""(it's like not smilling as broady).

When fact we humans perform this same impressive claculation every day. For instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

And here is when the facila actions emotional act he knows you are a not happy he knows what is going on in your life.

The evidence for to suppor the claims is we need to have experince and whe to know how to use the claims if we know all the information of the claim we go to know how to support the claim.

The introduction of ah boddy an ah conclusion to your essay that it is more of our personallity we have to know was is goin on in our's life in our body because we are the person who knows evrything about our's life not body knows our body not body know what is going on in or conclusion only we knows.

The Mona Lusa demonstraction is really intended to bring ah smile to your face while it shows just how much this computer cnad do imagine ah computer that knosw when you're happy or sad that's why is sometime important thw computer.

And finally the Meanwhilw ,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palabrearus make crow's-feet around your eyers.( That's instruction #2.) But in ah false smile, the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and ah different muslce.

But by the way ,did making a happy face in this experiment also make yo feel/ slightly happy and according to the facial feedback ,Theory of Emotion moving your facil muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them.

And know we have ah leasson in this life we need to smile we need to by happy for the resct of our's life we only have one life and we have to smile is not worry was is going on the problems is something normal in the life all the people has problemas or something like that but you need to be happy is doesn't care all the thing bad or the problem's with family smille in this life.

c2acd73,"In the article ""Making Mona Lise Smile,"" the author describes a wonderful technological advancement called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This technology allows for computers to analyze a human face and determine the emotion, or emotions, that person is feeling. With the help of this new software, Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at tge University of Illionois, and Professor Nicu Sebe, of the University of Amsterdam, were able to determine that the Mona Lisa is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. This outstanding innovation can be very beneficial to society. They have created something that can not only help us have a better understanding of the body, but can also change the way we communicate in drastic ways.

With FACS we, as people, will be able to better understand the anatomy behind joy, depression, anger, all of it! We will have access to parts of the brain that millions of scientists have never understood. FACS creates oprotunity for discovery far beyond what we already know. For centuries scientists have been asking, ""What makes a happy person happy?"" and ""What is causing all these mood swings?"" With these advancements applied, we can know when a change in mood happens and use brain scans to figure out where and why this is happening.

""Communication is key!"" That's something we all hear all of the time but no one seems to be any good at. The suicide rate is out of control and the divorce rate is crazy high. Using FACS we can deminish these numbers! A simple understanding of the emotions another human is displaying can change, and save, lives. If we have the technology to understand what a person is feeling, then we can fix things before they completly fall apart. We can offer solutions to the problems that people are facing everyday simply by understanding how they feel and what is causing their hurt. This technology could be the difference between wether or not your parents stay together or your friend jumps off a bridge. That is why I believe this technology should be immediately incooperated into society. It can save lives, it can save love.

FACS is an important technology that needs to be applied to everyday life as soon as possible. Not only will it change the world for the better but it will be the difference between life and death.",4,7,0.7788230776786804
c2b3309,"Using the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom setting for students is valuable because it can enhance how humans can express and analyze emotions to and from each other. A valuable skill to learn is being able to express ones thoughts and emotions to others well. Learning this is school is essential for students in the classroom and wherever else they go in life for a better knowledge of how to listen to others and also communicate a message with a certain tone to others. Humans unconsciously convey through their face what they are feeling, but completely knowing how a person is feeling from their facial expression is not always possible. With this accurate technology, the software can translate ""anatomical information as electronic code."" Examining the way that one reveals emotion through their face can help that person to fine tune their expressions to convey or even conceal their thoughts and emotions. Through this technology students would be able to have a better understanding of how to express emotions and messages to others in addition to analyzing what others communicate to them.",2,7,0.8967897295951843
c2d42a7,"wether you are 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percet angry people shouldnt go around measruing your emotions. I think that emotions are something very personal that should be kept for ourselves. There is a difference between asking a friend how they feel and being there for then versus measuring their emotions, and only working on that part of emotiong thatthey want to get rid of. what of they device has gathered the wrong information ? That means we would be helping people in the places they dont need help.

In the article they keep rerfering the facial muscle and what they represt and how the computer identifices them. Us humans look at people and predict they are feeling some type of way but we could be wrong, becuase only the persons can feel how that emotion. Eventhough they mention all the different features the computer has to identify our emotions I dont believe that our technology is advance to a point where it can do all of those things. In fact i believe this system is pointless becuase we dont need to worry about other people and their personal space.

In conclusion my opinion is that we dont have this system in our school. I say this because teachers shount be worried about our personal emotions. School should focus on better ways on teaching people versus worryingabout theyre personal emotions. Sometimes our emotions are not being the scholl but by the problems we have at home witch makes it irrelent to have this system. That is why i say we shouldnt have this system.

I think that Facial Action Coding Systems could be useful for students because the computer could read your emotions and make changes just like a real teacher. For example, in the passage it says, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is feeling confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This means that a computer lesson could change if the computer determined that you were bored. It could also explain more fully if it determined you were confused. This software could be very useful in school computers.

Facial Action Coding Systems could also help teachers by showing how the kids are feeling. The software could alert teachers if a student was confused, upset, bored, ect. In the passage it says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with a characteristic movements of the facial muscles. This means that the software is acurate and could help teachers determine how a kid is feeling. This could help teachers because the teacher could then react to how the kid is feeling. If a kid was sad the teacher could comfort them and if the kid was mad the teacher could talk with them. This could help teachers out very much and could decrease school violence.

Facial action coding systems could be very useful to students and teachers. It could help students that are taking online classes because the computer could respond like an actual teacher. This software could help teachers by showing the kids emotions. Then the teacher could react to how the student is feeling. For these reasons I think Facial Action Coding Systems could be very useful to teachers and students in schools.",3,7,0.84995037317276
c312f80,"Technology has come so far and grown tramendously. This invention that can tell ones feelings from a simple move of a muscle would be perfect for classroom use. Many adolesence in the school setting get tired, bored, or distracted, this invention could notify the teacher when this happens or even change the assignment to something more interesting for that specific person.

Many teens in our society suffer from anxiety and depression. This invention might even be able to save lifes, it could show when one is sad and in a school setting, could notify a counselor or friend to talk to. When someone is feeling highly angery it could rearrange the computers content to something cheerful or happy to try and alter the mood. One could feel stressed or overwhelmed which can lead to many things and with the help of these new technologies many feelings of discomfort could be resolved.

In the article it states many facts that are shown just from a facial expression. It also tells how the computer is able to do this , ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". It states the main emotions that are available from facial movements now listing the following; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also finds hidden emotions like when one says they are fine, but you notice they actually seem sad. The computer can tell if a facial expression is false because of the certain muscles that move with it.

A huge example of research was done on a pianting of the Mona Lisa. The test that was taken on the facial expressions of this painting show that she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. This shows alot about what this new technology can do and shows that it is proven to work.

The article shows how this experiment could be very benefitting and its just what every day classroom settings need. This new technology could be life saving and game changing, and its time to change the game and help many teens ones step at a time.       ",3,7,0.8352493047714233
c31b9fc,"I do believe that the use of this technology is and will be extremely valuable.

Some evidence to support why i believe this type of technology could be very valuable is that in the first sentence the article states""She's 83% happy, 9 % desgusted,6% fearful and 2% percent happy. This means that advanced technology can find out all if that information about human emotions and possibly more and it is as easy as calculating homework.This type of technology can also be useful and valuable becasue a situation could be where someone can't express thier emotions, or doesn't know how to express their emotions.That's where FACS come in,(Facial Action Coding System).Also too add to me agreeing that this technology could be very valuable, the Facial Action Coding System was used on Mona Lisa. She never smiles, it's very rare you catch her doing it. So who knows her emotions.

To add to my reasoning the Facial Action Coding System can also be useful is because students in classrooms expressions be so blank, all you can assume is that the students dont wanna be there. But what if there's more to it? What if behind those blank faces is a whole world of emotons,im pretty sure everybody has emotions.Some people love showing them. Some are shy to show them,and others just dont know.But they can know with FACS. It starts with a 3-D computer model of the face that shows the 44 major muscles.FACS has 6 basic emotions,happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness.

So to conclude my argument i do believe this tye of technology can be very valuble in students classroom because all students has emotion, just some have a hard way of showing them.FACS stands for Facial Action Coding System. It is a new software that has ben developed to shows the basic six emotions of human emotions.Which was modeled on The Mona Lisa.And according to the new software she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted,6% fearful,2% angry.

Maybe you're sad or depressed and you don't even know it, but a computer software knows and could make you not even express that feeling to anyone or possibly help in anyway.

Lets say you are tired of seeing ads on the internet you dislike. Well the facial reconizing software can help. In the article 'Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. but if you frown the next add will be different.""

I feel it is always important for you or someone else to know how are are feeling because what if you just aren't having a good dasy, someone can help. You're easily able to tell how a friend is feeling by the look of their face, but the computer software is very advance and will get way more accurate answers based off a very slight move from your neutral face.

c369266,"Facial codeing is it useful?

Technology is it really advanced enough to know whether or not someone is happy? Is the way we are suppose to look when angry the way to judge somebody, what if it's there natural face? would somebody take offense if they drew a drawling that was suppose to be happy but the computer said it was only 64 percent happy?i know i would now let me tell you what i think.

Technology is really cool don't get me wrong i think technology is the greatest invention in this world. But i believe we all know the fact that technology can get really expensive and for really stupid reasons So, i am going against this and here's why. How this works is the computer takes a face into a 3-D model and there are suppose to be 44 muscles that move. In paragraph three there's is a part that says ""For example, your frontails pars lateralis muscle (above your eye) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"". Now your probably saying ok why are you against it, because not everyones eybrows move when they're surprised.

Personally my eyebrows also move when im really tired, nervouse buzzed out on nicotine or simply when i have the jitter bugs becaus im scared and shaking. ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguisted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". This is where the role play of me not aggree with this comes in, i honestly feel like the computer is throwing numbers at you we cant be accurate. and even if we were there doing this on scientifically how the muscle should look which is a lot of bull crap to me. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artist such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"". So, right there we can see yeah he may be able to get pretty damn close but im sorry da Vinci just being close isn't enough for me you would have to be right on the dot.

I get it's not going to be a perfect 100 pecent happy but how do we know it's 83 percent. Why cant't it be a 73 percent or a 65 yeah i get all of there percents add up to 100% but how do we not know the computer is just not being lazy and picking the easiest numbers to add. For examp they could do 75 percent happy, 12 percent disgusted, 10 percetn fearful and 3 percent that's how i see mona lisa in the picture. or it could even be something along the lines of 75 percent happy, 12 percent disgusted, 6 percent angry, and then 7 percent angry.

I dont know if any of this made my point come across but here's my point. everyone will look at this picture or anyother picture and everyone will think differently of it you wont have a right or wrong answer. just like everyone will have a right or wrong answer about this form of technology. we could look at grandpa joe and say damn he looks very upset and angry he doesnt want to be here. but maybe in all reality thats just his face. Grandpa could be happier then you although you probably arn't happy grading all of these test.

c3cdc0c,"Facial Action Coding System Disadvantages

Imagine a world that only involves computers. No teachers, no parents to tell us what is best, no books and writing. Using computers for everything isn't always the answer. It is important to also use old fashion ways to determine emotion no matter how much someone dislikes it. Using the Facial Action Coding System we aren't able to figure out others emotions by ourselves, it assumes someones emotions just by the way someone is showing their face, and it can have technical difficulties which may provide false information.

To begin, it is important that we use context clues to determine someone's emotions. Using a computer app can take away from someone trying to figure out facial emotions by themselves. Sometimes it can be usfeul to figure out expressions by ourselves. This can help us with everyday people. We can't carry a computer everywhere we go and use it to determine if someone is sad, angry, happy, excited, etc.. If we figure out these expressions by ourselves we can apply those skills when it is necessary.

Moreover, some people hide their emotions causing us to believe something that may be false. For example, some depressed people hide the fact that they are very upset and hide it with a smile. If the Facial Action Coding System were to try and tell the emotions of that person smiling it would give a completely different set of emotions than the person is really feeling. There isn't much someone can do to fix the fact that misjudged faces can lead to false emotions.

Lastly, computer programs aren't always correct. They can have technical difficulties and give out the wrong information. Programs can mess up and give the total opposite of what is being presented. There could be times where this Facial Action Coding System can say someones emotions are angry and mad. In reality the person could've been very happy or pleased. Programs mess up all the time so it isn't always credible to use one.

In conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System wouldn't be to useful. It may lead to false information, take away from peoples everyday skills, and have technical diffuclties. Using what we know about humans can take us a long way and maybe even help us more than a program will. Although the system seems like it can help with emotions it can do more harm than good.",4,7,0.8385286331176758

Therefore, we may not actually know how our friends are feeling because, some of them might not show their emotions while they are with friends. On the other hand though, the people who do show emotions might actually get help by their friends or maybe even someone at school or outside of school besides just having the computer figure out how you are feeling. Meanwhile, some people might not actually show emotions on their faces, they might have the emotions trapped inside but they are good at holding it in.

The real question is, would this be helpful or benefit us in a classroom? I think yes. The author states that ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar one might follow."" Can you imagine having a computer that knows when your happy or sad? Having computers like these in school classrooms would be so valuable, due to the lack of ""fun"" in school, these computers could determine when youre bored in class and change something about it. Or say you're learning a new lesson in math class, and you're becoming very confused. The computer would recognize your confusion by the facial expression you have and help you out. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Another reason this technology would be helpful is because it would be less physical work and planning for the teacher.

A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is claimed to help computers identify the different emotions of humans. Researchers have used this technology on Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" to detect what she is possibly feeling. I don't believe this technology could accurately read someone's emotions without tapping into someone's brain waves.

Sleep study technicians use electrodes to detect how well someone sleeps, and what happens while they sleep. So why wouldn't this form of technology have to use the same principles to figure out what someone's true emotion is? Some people have a naturally ""blank"" face, so if you're using technology that uses someone's facial muscles, is it going to detect that the person is bored?

The article gives a set of instructions of which muscles to move to make it look like someone is genuinely happy. As far as this technology knows, a student could be just pretending to be bored so that the lesson could be modified as if a teacher would modify it so that the student could get engaged more.

If a teacher is having a student do the assignments online, how can the technology tell the difference between concentration, or boredom? It would be like a teacher having to tell the difference between a student who isn't feeling well compared to someone who is just faking it. You can't really know what someone is feeling without actually being in that perosn's mind.

Someone who could be tired from not getting enough sleep the night before, could also be confused with someone who is angry or bored. How is a computer technology going to be able to the tell the difference without actually detecting the different brain waves? It seems almost impossible to tell how someone is feeling without having them tell you directly.

If schools used this type of technology to help teachers figure out what students are feeling during assignments, I feel like it would be distracting. Even if a student didn't know the technology was there. To me, the idea of being on a computer to do school work is distracting in itself.

I feel like the concept is a good idea, but I also believe that it definitely needs some modifications. I don't think it would be a good idea to have it in a school setting, but maybe in a psychologist/psychiatrist setting possibly. I also feel that there should be more emotions than just six. There is a much wider variety of emotions than just happy, sad, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In conclusion, this technology shouldn't be used in school.

c503e41,"The creation of the Facial Action Coding System has the potential to be very innovative and useful in today's society. In schools, teachers often have difficulty obtaining the attention of students and maintaining it when they have it. This could be a result of the way they are teaching, and how it makes the students feel. The use of FACS in all classrooms would be found valuable.

Problems such as obtaining attention could easily be solved with the use of the FACS. If students are placed in a classroom, and are unhappy and bored, they are less likely to pay attention and learn at the rate they are capable of. The FACS can record these students' emotions and help change the method of teaching used in that class to interest the students. As stated in the passage by Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This could potentially change the students attitude towards learning for the better.

A teacher is capable of understanding verbal communication better than that which is nonverbal. Unless a student tells their teacher he or she is confused or bored, the teacher has little to no way of knowing this. Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" The FACS is able to detect such forms of emotion, and make corrections based upon them. This process makes the FACS more capable of dealing with these situations than any teacher.

Emotion is displayed often through facial expressions. Certain muscles in your face respond to specific emotions you are feeling at the time. It is not uncommon for a student to put on a fake smille or expression of understanding towards a teacher when he or she is bored and could care less. A teacher may have some difficulty understanding if the student's emotions are real or fake. Luckily the FACS recieves data from the recognition of movement in muscle tissues. The FACS is programmed to recognize which muscles move during each emotion. To provide an example the author explains, ""But in false smiles, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" SInce a different muscle is used in fake smiling than in that which is real, the FACS can tell the difference between the two expressions with ease.

The facts about FACS suggest that it is a perfect candidate for the use of innovative technology in the classroom. This system can improve the learning rates, as well as the mental growth of the students in a classroom. FACS can easily be proven valuable in all classrooms, as well as in many other environments among modern society.

Rather than a computer doing all the work. Not everybody is going to feel the same, but atleast it's worth a shot to try.

Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate. We already have enough of technology to do those kind of obsticales.

According to me it will be helpful because we can find person in front of us is lie to us or not.

My second reason we can find person in picture is happy or not. In picture Mona Lisa was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" According to me we can express how person is feeling while taking picture.

My third reason we can find person's emotion weather he/she is happy or not. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)."" According to me with Facial Action Coding System we can express others feeling if they were not happy we can help them and make them smile.

These are my three main reasons why Facial Action Coding System is helpful in our life.",3,7,0.7120499610900879
c547463,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This piece of technology allows us to read the emotional expressions of our peers and well, paintings, such as Da Vinci's, Mona Lisa. From this, it has been discovered that Mona Lisa was eighty-three percent happy, six percent fearful, nine percent disgusted, and two percent angry. I believe that the information recieved from the Facial Action Coding System is valuable.

In today's world, we rely so much on technology that it's hard to see a world without it. We all use technology everyday whether it be a computer, cellphone, or even a television. With advancements and improvements in technology, that leads us to believe that the accuracy of technology is reliable. In the article, the author talks about the software. The emotion-recognition software can track anything from a real face to a painting, and tell whether or not the person is angry, sad, mad, or happy. Humans use this same technique everyday. In the article, the text states ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Well that's just what the Facial Action Coding System does. Facial expressions are universal. Based on the article, we can tell that technology is more fast and efficient working than ever. Technology is like our brains, it processes things quickly and with accuracy.

Most of the time the human eye can tell how someone is feeling, but we are not always certain because it is difficult for us to desribe facial features. There's no need for that when upcoming technology can do it for you. In the text, it tells us that artists study human anatomy for precision when painting the face. The software Dr. Huang uses detects the small things such as the slight curve of a lip or even the squint of an eye to determine emotions. The Mona Lisa shows us just that. An example from the text is ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar might follow."" This is because even our computers can detect our emotions and follow it with an ad similar to how we are feeling.

From the article, the reader can even try the expressions for themselves to test the accuracy. I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. If the student is stressed or mad but not willing to confront a teacher about how they are feeling, the teacher can know based on the technology or even looking for the small things such as a curve of the lip. This may take stress off of students as well as adults.       ",4,7,0.848607063293457
c559e18,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System technology is to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom which is not valuable to a classroom. In my honest opinion I believe it is very unnecessary. The first reasoning is that this technology that was developed was developed for a very different purpose than the usage of a classroom. My second reasoning is that the technology doesn't even claim to detect the boredness of the students. Others may argue that it will help students in a positive way but they are completely wrong because it will do up to nothing for them. All these reasonings combined are the main factors as to why i believe that the usage of this technology is not valuable in the school environment.

My first reasoning as to why i believe that this facial and emotional recognition technology is not valuable in a classroom setting is because the sole purpose as to why it was built was to detect emotions in an individual. It was not developed to help students make learning easier in any way. According to the article 'Making Mona Lisa Smile' by Nick D'Alto, ""New software has been developed that improves the accuracy in percieving the emotions of others. This new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has promising application for a variety of industries."" This is evidence that helps support my claim because it is a statement that explains the purpose of this new technology which is only for the detection of emotions in the face of humans and not to help young students to advance their school life. Also, according to the article 'Making Mona Lisa Smile' by Nick D'Alto, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutra face (showing no emotions)."" This statement/quote is evidence of my claim because again it states the true purpose of this technology and what it is truly used for; not once in that statement had it discussed how it would help students better their education.

My second reasoning as to why i believe this technology is not best fit for the school environment is because the technology is used to only detect 6 emotions and using it to help teachers combat ""boredom"" within their student is not one of them. The article 'Making Mona Lisa Smile' by Nick D'Alto states, "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-hapiness,surprise,disgust,fear and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" This is evidence because the quote clearly states that the emotions that are detectable are not inclusive to boredome if the technology can't detect boredom

or confusion then how can it help with the students. The article 'Making Mona Lisa Smile' by Nick D'Alto also states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confusesd or bored,' Doctor Huang predicts."" This is evidence of my claim/reasoning because this statement by the creater of this technology even says it COULD happen which leads us to infer that it probably would not happen anytime soon, meaning that although this technology is smart it still may not be able to help students out.

Others may argue that the usage of this Facial Action Code System will help students positively in the classroom but they are completely wrong. This system may not even help them at all. According to the article 'Making Mona Lisa Smile' by Nick D'Alto, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr.Huang 'So computers need to understand that, too.'""

This is evidence as to why those that argue it is a positive effect is wrong because the inventer of this technology basically stated the technology has more to understand (such as the emotional communications of humans), meaning that this technology may not fully comprehend all of the emotions of not just humans but students if this technology was to be placed in the classroom settings. Also according to the article 'Making Mona Lisa Smile' by Nick D'Alto, ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" This is evidence because it states what it could do for a students which is adding more cartoon expresions

and thats basically about it. It doesn' really help out a students when theyre confused just because there are more animated cartoons.

In conclusion, I believe that the Facial Action Coding System is not a valuable usage in a classrrom of students. First, the technology was built for asole purpose of detecting facial emotions and not to help students in any way but add cartoons. Second, the technology is not advanced enough to even detect emotions of boredom in students , it can only detect six emotions in which bored is not one. Others may argue that it will positively impact the students but they are completely wrong because it literally does nothing for them. Finally, in my most honest opinion this technology is mainly useless in a classroom which is why it is clearly not valuable in a classroom environment that includes students. ",5,7,0.8671901226043701
c5c1b30,"Being able to detect how other people are feeling can be a satisfiying and critical thing to use or to know. When the historical and famous picture that was taken of Mona Lisa famouse painting with her smiling can be a miss lead consuption or an unexpected photo at the time. With the FACS it was able to detect Mona Lisa's expression through the photo. She was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. The FACS isnt able to detect what Mona Lisa was happy, upset, angry, disgusted or fearful at the time. The only thing it was able to capture are her feelings but not towards what she was feeling for.

Being able to know that the person that you are analizing can have certain emotion's towards you or towards others is a good thing. If you were to have a significant other or some one that you are intrested in is sending mix signal can be complicated and people wouldn't be able to tell, it can be usefull but, can also be a disadvatage. There are people who tend to be complicated when they aren't wanting to. It would be easy tp know if there were to be a detected FACS. But how would it be for sure that it was towards that one specific person. For instance in the Mona Lisa picture/painting.",2,7,0.589135468006134
c5d4de9,"Someone takes a selfie, and sends it to their friend trying to make it seem like they are completely happy with no problems at all. However, what if you were able to tell if your friend is really happy or not? There is a facial coding system that can identify other's emotions. The use of this technolgy to read emotional expressions is valuable because, it can recognize facial movements to see how other's feel, the computer can make faces seem more expressive, and it also teaches you more about your smile and whether it is genuine or forced.

It has been shown that Mona Lisa was about 83% happy when the picture was taken, it shows that it was mostly a happy smile. There are usually ablout six different kinds of emotions, such as,""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". This shows that there many emotions that could be discovered by just a simple picture. As an example, your eyebrows are usually raised when your are surprised or your lips would be tightened to show anger. The software would usually have mixed emotion, and it is usually compared to a nuetral face that shows no emotion. We humans are actually able to do the same thing, just by the look/expression on their face. Some specific artists such as, da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint specific emotions with facial emotions.

Computers are capable of doing many different things that not even humans can do. One very important thing is creating different expressions for others. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This was said by Dr. Huang, and it was normally used to make even animated faces more expressive. It is true that most human communication is nonverbal, and some computers may need to understand that too. There are some simple instructions that encode different emotions, this was also used to create Mona Lisa's smile.

This system teaches you more about your smile and whether it is forced or not. There is certain muscular action units that indicate the difference between both smiles. For the real smile which is called ""zygomatic major"" which are actually muscles that begin at your cheek bones, it would lift the corners of your mouth. However for the false smile, the mouth would be stretched out sideways and it would ues the zygomatic major and the risorius. To many exerts they know that it is true thatfaces tell the truth and when a celebrity takes a selfie with a false smile, it is usually a sign that it they are not being truthful. There is an important theory of emotion that expresses and produces emotions.

Facial action coding systems can be used for very useful things. This this technology is extemely valuable because, it is able to recognize how others feel by facial movements, more expressive faces can be made with these computers, it shows the difference between genuine smiles and forced smiles.

c60eda0,"The facial action coding system for emotions was developed to detect different emotions. It may seem creepy to know everyones emptions but it can benefit teachers. It can even help out people in general to identify different emotions on people. The technology should be used to read students expressions. The technology should be used in school for its uniqueness, lessons, and overall connection to students and teachers.

With the system, teachers can detect truthfullness in their students. It can help connection with students and their teachers, or even just peers. People can force different faces to convince others to think they are different that how they actually feel. But, with the system you can tell when someone is genuine about a emotion. For example, there are certain muscles that move when someone is truly happy. The muscular units move around, the muscles at the cheek bones lift, and the crow feet around your eyes move.

The system itsself is highly intelligent, and completely new to our generation. The technology is advanced and had never been created before. The sytem can calculate the percentages of different emotions on people. There are a variety of emotions that it detects such as happiness, surprise, anger, disguist, fear, and sadness. It can even be used for ads to see if someone is interested in a certain thing. If they remain happy, they will show similar ads.

The coding sytem can be used by teachers for lessons. Students can appear bored and not interested in class. With the sytem, teachers know when they are into and engaged into their learning in the class. The system would detect the facial muscles to recognize them as uninterested. Then, they can adjust the lesson to engage more students and improve their learning overall.

In conclusion, teachers and schools should utilize this system and work it into their lessons. It has tons of benefits to learning. It is something new and advanced to the society. Also, it can be used to get more students invloved in learning, and ensure excited engaged students. Overall, the coding system can help with lessons, connection, and its uniqueness to society.

Anyone who keeps up with the news should be able to say that the world is getting more messed up every day. In the last few weeks there has been another school shooting. To think about what would make a kid go and shoot people at a school or anywhere is hard to imagine. This is where this program should be implented at schools. The program could be used to anylise the daily emmotion level of students. If a studient is always unhappy, scared, or anything that shows a bad emmotion for a period of time the school can then act an see what the studients problem is. Nick D'Alto said that it could be used to help students be more ingaged and enjoy school more. This should not be used, unless the kid is being home schooled or using some form of an online class. This is because there is no way for a teacher to consantly moniter their students wheil teaching and there is not a good way for them to adapt when nessasary in the time that they have. Also kids are already unhappy to be at school and not too mention how teired they are.

For this program to be used at school it should only be used to monater their happyness levels to prevent studients from doing bad things like commiting suiside or doing a school shooting.

c6392b4,"The latest technology called the FACS or Facial Action Coding System detects the emotional state of kids or adults. This technology is a leading way to help students out in a classroom or a work environment. This technology is supposedly able to help find the emotions of a human and how they feel by recognizing their facial features and muscles.

This new technology FACS, known as the Facial Action Coding System reads the facial features and the way humans use their muscles in their faces to recognize their emotional state, whether they be happy, sad etc. This new technology would not benefit our society today for the reason that we have careers and jobs in understanding humans emotional state, the time, money and effort spent in learning this would all be replaced by a robot or new technology, this causes jobs to be lost and people that spent their lives and money learning this career are out of a job because of a technology. FACS is good in a way to survey an area of people but not a necessity to the world today.

Although reading a students emotional state in a classroom is a good benefit and way to figure out whether or not that student needs more help or is the reason he/she are a disturbance in class or failing in a classroom. I believe it is a good thing to have at a school because kids today hide their emotions, and avoid socialization because of their emotional state, and if we have that today in our classrooms we could help kids grades rise, fights lessen, and even could stop bullying with knowing that a kid is in fear, why is he/she in fear? or a kid is sad? etc. These things help us understand what to do in order to keep the school safe and student happy in the classroom.

If the FACS is able to read students emotions and detect if that human is sad, happy etc. then yes this technology would be a great resource in the classroom or school today because of so many things happening over the world teachers and their staff should be able to use this technology to undestand their students emotions in order to help them in a classroom and figure out how to help them in academics for a better future. The article in this passage talks about how the FACS can even adress emotional views from a picture that dated back to the era when Da Vinci was painting, and this even could give us what emotion the Mona Lisa out out and how Da Vinci used facial features to depict emotion in his paintings, this could bring out the views of people back in the 1800s or even earlier.

Though I am not for this technology for the fact that we do not need a machine or computer telling us what state of emotion were in, it could be a great use in the school board today with all the violence and cyber communication that happens. The only good reason to bring this computer or technology into the public is in our classrooms to keep the students in a good school environment so that they can succeed and continue with grades that meet the highest standards so that they can have an education to look upon when they apply for a job, for that is the only reason this could even be worth the money.

Overall the technology or FACS, is a good learning tool for our school board and classrooms today, but only for the student body this could work tremendous and help our society. If there was a way to create a facial recognition system that could help our society and our criminals today and understand how they think then there is a chance that this could go farther in our world. Overall this new technology is not a good source or worth the money to put out to the public, I say this because as our world gets older and our generation furthers themselves, it is too easy to see the emotional state of human beings, we do not need a computer to say it understands better than the human body that gets study everyday.",4,7,0.8897057771682739

Dr. Huang and his colleaugue are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

People, Muesums, and Schools are still wandering ""to this day"" if Leonardo Da Vinci made his famous painting of Mona Lisa with a smile on ""her"" face, well, in Paragraph 1(Lines 1-2), there is a descripion of how Nick D'Alto is saying that Mona Lisa is Eighty-Three percent happy, Nine percent disgusted, Six percent fearful, and Two percent angry. The new technology system being described in the

Facial Action Coding System (suggested by Dr. Huang) could possibly make a big difference of how Mona Lisa ""REALLY FEELS"", and how it would be easier for students to learn about whether or not ""She"" was made ""HAPPY"" in Da'Vinci's paintings.

Body Paragraph-

Some students in the Twenty-First Century are not willing to learn about certain topics in school because of all the other amazing internet resources and games they think are part of computer freedom, but inspite of Three- Dimentinal vision, Mona Lisa could have been much angrier than what she might have seemed like in her face, and she might have been fearful because of her hair style and her looks ""in the dark!"" Maybe, there was a possibility that a demostration of Mona Lisa could test how well with a(n) computer with ""2020 Vision Software"", or have a(n) emotional sensor flashdrive to attach to your PC Engine when you want there to be certain conducting over feelings from your computer technology. I think that this kind of technology is kind of un-realistic, but it would be a good source for what the person studying in will thinks about what he learned in the past ""Once enough of the Life-Story of the person has gone by."" In Paragraph 3 ""Lines 18-31"", I would imagine that constructing a computer that has a lot of functions and features could lack the knowledge of a person's understanding of how to ""USE"" the computer properly, which will turn out to be more like ""TRASHWARE"" than ""SOFTWARE"". The biggest part I think the Facial Action Coding System ""Is Worth"" is how you can just control anything in your ""IMAGINATION"" to discover the strong ways that you can make video games from your imagination, show how you truly feel, and picture yourself "" in that video game."" Dr. Huang is not a bad ""Pre- Innovator"", but he could have added specific date(s) to his context.

Conclusion-

If a type of computer with 3-D software were to exist, then there would be a great possibility that by Two- Thousand Twenty, there will be the greatest chance of a computer with special features existing ""if Dr. Huang will start planning how the computer he's wishing to come out will be invented.""",1,7,0.7134787440299988
c762f49,"It would be a cool thing to have for something to read your facial expressions. But i don't think it will work very well because what happens if someone doesn't show much facial expressions. You just can't go by what their facial expression is. What if someone is having a bad day but is showing no facial expression about it.

The facial expression machine would be fun to have until we need something more new that can read facial expressions and nonfacial expressions. The reason we need something more new i becuase the fact that the machine can get it wrong if the person isn't showing a facial expression. Like you can't just tell by that becuase they can go wrong. The person may not show emotions that much so they can hide it really well. Also people don't really like to tell people how they are feeling.

So if they did have a machine that can read facial expressions but can't read emotions that they are hiding isn't a very good machine. They just need to build a machine that can do both. All because someone can be something else then what the machine picks up. So they need something that can do both so it can be right. All because of the reason someone don't show a whole lot of emotions. Plus the person can be lying to the machine and the machine picks up that you are happy but really you are not.

What this can prove is that the process of expression recognization requires no harm to the face or person and is created by the studies of not only technological professionals, but also psychological preoffesionals as well.

In a school where you are teaching math you would like to know what a student was thinking Dr. Huang said that ""when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" you would be able to tell with the Facial Action Coding System. This system will be able to improve what the instructor can teach us because he can see what we are thinking. These classroom computers will be able to tell us what we fell about the subject so lets say we are confused and the teacher knows that he could explain what is being taught to you in a different way so that you get it. The instruct can also see if you are bored so he can tell you to snap back into it or let the class take a little break.

c7a806f,"It's FACTS That We Don't Need FACS

Being in school brings out a mix of emotions in every student. Wether the student is stressed, happy, or sad depends on many different variables. A student can feel these emotions because of a situation at home, a problem with a friend, and obviously because of the lessons or schoolwork going on in class. Can a machine truly and effectively montior these emotions? Is a machine like this really needed in the current education system? It's not, The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a calssroom is not valuable.

First of all, human emotions are complex. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" gave us several examples of muscles in the human face that were used when expressing emotion. A couple examples of these are the ""frontalis pars lateralis,"" and the ""orbicularis oris."" Although these muscles and the parts of the face they move are an important part of dictating emotion, that's not all there is to understanding emotion. Body language is a massive part of emotion. The FACS may register a happy smile, but it won't see slouching shoulders. The text even states that, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion.)"" This means the FACS reads a blank expression as showing no emotion. What if someone with a person with a blank expression is conveying emotion through body language? Being a student and teenager, body language is a huge part of communication. With the FACS not being able to read body language, that's already a giant hole in its value.

Next, how useful would this technology be outside of an elementary school setting? The answer is absolutely not useful. In elementary school the teacher caters to each students' needs. They're able to do so because you have the same 20 to 30 kids every minute of every day for 180 schools days. But, in middle school and high school students have seven to eight different teachers throughout the day. Middle and high school teachers don't have the one on one time to cater to their students. As cold as it sounds, middle and high school teachers simply might not even care about their students feelings. At least not to the degree an elementary teacher would. Teachers in the upper levels have a strict set of standards that they need to teach. Students must then master those standards to pass the class. There isn't enough time for an upper level teacher to care about their students' emotions.

Finally, students are kids. Kids experience a plethora of emotions throughout the day. Even though, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are unviersal,"" what would one use the information gathered from FACS for? Dr. Huang believes that, ""it [FACS] could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The fact that the text states that FACS is just as effective as a human teacher completely renders itself useless. If Dr. Haung, the software engineer of FACS, believes that this machine performs on an equal level to a human, there is absolutely no need for the FACS. As previously mentioned, upper level teachers do not have the time to modify their lesson plans due to their students emotions. That fact alone removes the need for the FACS.

In conclusion, the use of FACS is not valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The FACS does not have a place in the current education sytem. With evidence from the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is clear that the FACS is only on the same level of reading emotions as, ""an effective teacher."" This renders the FACS not only as useless to students in a classroom, but also as a likely massively more expensive alternative to human teachers.    ",6,7,0.8442349433898926
c801518,"In this article it talks about the face of Mon Lisa. Many of people have wondered and thought what Mona was feeling or was trying to express. Will now they came out with a new software were it recgonizes and tell the experssions of ones face. To me I don't like the idea of the software, it can be subatage to someones art. In parapgraph one in the beginning of the sentnce it gives you bunch of facial expressions that Mona is giving. The software indicates several expressions that she is making. In paragraph 3 says when the process begins, the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. They recognize the the muscles and what the face is expressing.

To me this software of a cheat cheat to art. Art is meant to be looked at, to be studied and to make you more intrested in the art. You can have a millions of questions about an art piece the cool thing about the Mona Lisa is that it is a very famous painting, why because it was unique, people wondering for many years to see if she is smiling or no or what she's is expressing. in paragraph 5 says,""We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" Which is a good thing becuase we learn more about the face and how they make it with expressions.

A software shouldn't be able to tell what they're expressing it just makes you not observe the photo anymore as much, because now that they may know what she's expressing she won't have the much popular attention to it like it did before. Says in paragraph 6,""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows how much this computer can do."" Really it even says imagine a computer knowing when your happy or sad, to me thats just invasion to a person, you can always tell you how you are feeling and many just decide to keep them to themselves.

Many people have their way of expressing themselves and sometimes you can be curious of how they're feeling. Which is good because the more you look at something you study it and you put piece and piece together until you solve it. Look at pragraph 7, it gives you something to do while your looking in the mirror, to make a face expression, and the face they told you to make was smiling. It's showing how easily you can describe someone face just by describing the face and the muscle form. It's not always good for everyone to know what you're face is expressing because thats just dull. It's not important for people to know, which will just make you more curious of you. Just as long as you know what your feeling, and thats what I think the artist that did this painting was trying to achieve.

This is my opinion on the software. I think that it is useless. It really is something that is happening now in this world is that technology is taking over us and what we do. We barley use our brains to study or read over something because we use the internet for that. We don't play outside or even try to look at new things in the world because were distacted by our phones or the tv. Most people are barley active and decide just to lay around and look at a screen. Now this is another thing less for a person to worry about, and slowly things that we are capable of doing by ourselves and using our head wouldn't be neccary because there's a sofware to that for us. Artist express themselves in art and they want people to figure it out and admire their painting, not a software to tell us. We become intelligent more each day if we use our head and take time to think about and thats something that is good for the people.    ",3,7,0.6919488906860352

The process starts when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. An action movement is the movement of one or more muscles. Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of Facial Action Coding System. Eckman has classified six basic emotions. These emotions include happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Each emotion is associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. When you're surprised your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows. When you're angry your orbicularis oris tightens your lips.

The facial expressions for each emotions are universal. Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, like not smiling. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or a painting. Each a expression is compared against a neutral face, showing no emotion. Humans perform the same calculations everyday. Dr. Huang a creator of Facial Action Coding System says his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

With this new software if you smile when a Web ad appears another ad similar will follow. If you frown a different ad will appear. Dr. Huang predicts that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then the computer can modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication.

The classrom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored. That's not what we notice everyday in life on a computer in class. This computer will be able to recognize our emotions as if we were happy or sad. If we smile, a smiliar ad will appear on our screen but if we are unhappy then the ad will be different.

c976cb4,"The Mona Lisa is one of the greatest pieces of artwork Da Vinci has ever created. It shows great craftmanship and 83% happiness within her smile, according to a new face recognition software created Professor Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science, and Professor Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. It creates and analyzes a 3-D face to assume what the person is feeling. This could also help students in other ways, by scanning their faces and trying to help them if a problem seems confusing or difficult, but this would give them less privacy and less security. This new system may not even be accurate, in which if they analzyes and assumed wrong for the painting, then the students' expression would also be wrong, making this system completely false and unusable in any way.

First off, a painting is different than a person. You can't accurately assume what the expression is if a person painted it. The facial structure would be slighly different from the actual person, because there is no way to completely recreate a face, especially back when it was painted. It may be very similiar to the person, but it is not the same person, meaning that the software has incorrectly given this person inaccurate or false emotion in which they previously did not have.

If this software doesn't give the correct answers to a painting, then we can assume it wouldn't work a human. Humans can show more visual expression than the software can detect. There is no setting for nervousness or joy. If someone was crying tears of joy, the computer would see this differently, and say this person would be very sad instead of being joyful. Humans can also fake expressions. If someone was sad, but had a smile the entire day, the computer might sense some sadness, but not nearly enough to show they are truly sad and that the student shows more happiness than sadness as the time of scanning them.

Lastly, even if this went into effect, this is giving students almost no privacy or security when using a computer. Sure its helpful for learning in some ways, but they have to give the software new emotions like confusion. Even if the expression showing confusion is implemented, this doesn't mean its safe. From paragraph 6, it states: ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"". Why does this matter? This just gives more excuses on how student's privacy is being exploited. It's also quite useless. You could be thinking of something else besides the ad, but the computer would see that your expression is happy, so you would get a similar ad, which you may not enjoy at all. It just doesn't make any sense to put it in a computer.

This new software is a great concept and could used in many different ways that would be very helpful, but it doesn't seem advanced enough to be put inside lots of computers yet. It's also quite dangerous, since the computer is looking at everything you are doing, inside and now outside the computer even more closely.

Bringing this kind of technology into your lives could seriously damage your reputation, social life, or anything of the like if your computer got hacked. If the software is inaccurate, then when you want to use this feature on a computer, it would be wrong, making this a faulty piece of software, unable to accurately give the emotion you were hoping to give. This could lead to many problems in the future if this face recogniztion software is used in the future. It's just not good enough to be used in the real world yet. Maybe after some time, but as it is not, it's not ready. ",5,7,0.697109043598175

These are the reason why the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea.

The Facial Action Coding System is smart because it allows you to see if the students are bored, interested, or just out of it during the lesson you teach. And you could also figure out different type of ways to manke a lesson or activity better that excites the children you are teaching to. In the article it states "" Most humans communication is nonverbal,including emotional communcation."" So this is basically saying that if we are not communicated with our mouths then what better way then communicating with facial expressions. This is why the Facial Coding System is smart.

It's is unquie because no-one has ever thought of this until now so the fact that teachers action care about how there students feel should touch some people. its also unique because it can tell the way your face is moving and the way your muscles move. In the articke it states that

""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face: all 44 major muscles in the model must move like the human muscles.""This just pushed to shove that if a computer can track all of your muscles in your face that that's pretty unique and different. And on top of that, they would pay that much money to make sure the kids have a good education is cool.

Lastly its valuable because if it's bettering the kids education and making a difference in their community, thats good. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" its says ""feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression. Whoever tought thta making faces could reveal so much about science of emotions."" This is why its valuable because it can tell us things that we might not know but the computer knows.

Suddenly the screen changes all on it's own and gives her a different, more interactive problem to tackle. Feeling intrigued and more awake, she starts to work again. This method of engaging students could be made possible with the use of the Facial Action Coding System.

It's a technology that detects human emotions by reading them using all 44 of the major muscles in the face. It then calculates the emotion by associating the movement of the muscle with a specific emotion. This could be useful in classrooms because of it's ability to read student's facial expressions and then calculate their emotions.

Although you'd be able to read the faces of students who are excited or engaged, this technology would be more useful on the other end of the spectrum. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) could be used to help point out which students are bored, tired, or struggling. Adjustments could be made to learning plans and lessons in order to more effectively engage students of all ages and types, and help them learn better.

In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, one of the main developers of this technology, Dr. Huang, further explains how this could be useful in classroms, as well as other aspects of life.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System i dont't really think it's valuable in the classroom because i dont't thnk students want people to know if they are feeling any kind of depression,I mean the machine is amazing and all but i don't think students would want to hear about how they feel when they know because it'll just make them even more upset to hear it.

ca341c5,"Is using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom the right thing to do? What does this type of technology help other students on? Can it help people comunicate with others in the world? Is forcing a fake smile a good thing or bad.

First, using the ""Facial Action Coding System"" to read students emotions during class is good because it can let the teacher know how they feel. For an example, if a student was taking a test or a quiz online and was slacking off or getting tired, the computer would switch the questions up until they find the right questions to ask when the student face expression chamges. While doing that, it helps them stay on track and not get bored that easily. The system recognize emotion by the every muscles on your face. This new envention even figured out how Mona Liza was feeling by just technology.

Next, can it help comunicate better in the real life world? By using this new Facial Action Coding System, Students can now study what kind of emotions are shown when talking to other people. What I trying to say is that, they can find out when they are fake smiling,laughing, or even interested in the conversation. One example on fake smiling is that is you can see the bottom and upper teeth at the same time, they are really not smiling but just smiling to not make anything wierd. If someone that you are taking with is not interested on the topic guys are talking about, you can notice by simpily looking into their eyes and if they are just looking anywhere besides making eye contact, they are not even paying attention to you.

Finally, making a fake smile, is that a good thing? According to the Facial Feedback, moving your face muscles to smiling not only expresses emotions, but they also helps your facial muscles produce them. By even smiling actually makes you happy. To me, being happy is the best, why not to other people. A drama coach by the name of Constantin Stanislavsky, made mostly all his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning to create their emotions on stage. Feeling someone else's emotion stage may happen because we are not used to seeing that.

By using technology to see how stuents are, is that the good thing to do or bad? Does this type of technology help students. Can the Facial Action Coding System help people comunicate with others in the world? Can fake smiling help people around the world?",3,7,0.9059885740280151

The author, Nick D' Alto, expresses how people use different facial muscles to show different emotions. The software of this program can depict weither or not a smile is genuine. The different muscles used to produce a real smile, are different than when a person puts on a fake smile (paragraph 7 and 8).

A teacher can spend a whole class period trying to decide if his/ her students, actually understand. Everyone uses the same muscles for a confused expression, it just depends on how the expression is worn. If the FACS were to be installed onto their learning devices, it could depict a confused student faster and alert the teacher. It gets students the help they need, more efficiently.

In paragraph four, D' Alto tells how Dr. Huang observed, ""facial expressions are universal."" As mentioned before, everyone may look similar when feeling a certain way. It just depends on how much they show the emotion. Yes, your friend could look upset, or behave a certain way, and you'd know instantly. What if it was a stranger? Could you decode how they feel, as easily as for your friend?

Although it can be argued, that it's easy to point out an unhappy person, it actually isn't. That person can wear any expression they want, no matter how fake it is. Use of facial detecting software could help better point out those people. Using this technology in classrooms could be extremely effective, and valuable.

However, if the Facial Action Coding System is put in classrooms this could give students a chance to be more alive during a lesson. Since it is able to read our facial expressions, it can see when students are becoming bored or irritated of the lesson and switch it up a little bit. In fact, it could possibly make learning fun again. Students will no longer dread going to class all the time, and it can finally be something to look forward too.

By installing the Facial Action Coding System into classrooms, teachers would be able to understand their students emotions more, and know what to do if people are becoming distracted. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Teahcers would be able to know if they need to switch up the lesson and make it more entertaining. This could cause less problems in students failing in school, and really change everything. In fact, if more teachers make classroom learning fun, more students will be less likely to fail.

Now, students do pay attention in classrooms, but having this new system could benefit the teachers and the students. Students could finally see the fun in learning and teachers would know that students are bored. The Facial Action Coding System is a great idea and could help out a lot in classrooms. Learning can finally be fun again.   ",3,7,0.8115693926811218
ca6be42,"In my opinion, no the use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Do I believe computers are smart? Sure. But computers arent as smart as humans. Computers do what us humnas tell them to do. I don't believe they can be so advanced as to be asble to read our emotions.

Humans can't always identify another humans emotions, so how can a computer? There's people out in the world whos regular face looks like they're sad, mad, angry, happy, etc. The computers going to pick up that they're always the same emotion, no mater what the situation. Not only that, but there are tons more emotions then the classified six basic ones. Dr. Paul Eckman's FACS picks us just 6 emotions? If thats the case, the computers missing at least hundred other emtions. What about the other emotions? If someone is concerned, unpleased, or please is the computer going to be able to pick that up?

In the reading it says that Dr. Huang states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" How? Like i said before, computers do what we want them too. So how can they read our face expressions? Point blank, they can't. If the world agrees on using this technology for students in the classroom, its a bad idea.

To start with, is a invasion of privacy. If students dont want the teachers know if they're sad or in fear of something, then the teachers dont need to know. Nor do the other students or memebers of the school. If the teachers want to know if the students are bored, or uninterested the teacher should be able to ask the class 'Are you interested in this topic?"" ""Is this topic boring you."" Not being able to look at a screen and count how many are interested and how many are not

Second off Teachers are here to teach us, not be our parents and have pep talks with us. Is school about socializing and meeting people? Yes, to some extent it is. But school is for learning and preparing us for life out of school. Many schools talk about ""Oh, the consulers are here for you if you need to talk."" ""We want you to come and talk to us if something is wrong."" Seriously? That's all wrong. Am I the only kid that had to fill out a ""slip"" and waited until the consuler got with me? Uh, isnt it suppose to be the other way around? Being able to have a technology that can read the students expressions or emotions isnt right, it's honestly kind of dumb. The computer can pick up the six basic emotions right? So what happens if a students wants to get out of class? Does he or she put on a sad face and when the teacher notices sends them to the office? Kids arent dumb these days. We know how to work around the technology and beat the system.

In my opinion technology is getting out of hand. How long ago was that painting painted? A hundred years ago? I don't know. But how can we be so sure that back then people knew what emotions were? Was Mona Lisa really disgusted? If so, about what? Or was she really fearful? What was she so fearful about? What about being angry? Why was she angry? Why was she 4 emotions all at once? I dont know about you, but i've never had more then 2 emotions i felt at one time.

After reading this article and seeing my opinion it should be clear that i say no to having this in the classroom. I believe that thistechnology about reading emotions, shouldnt have even been invented. ",5,7,0.8226038217544556
caf5ac3,"In ""Making Mona Lisa smile"" the author describes a new technology that is called Facial Action Coding System. The Facial Action Coding System is a system that can cacualte your emotions. The technology should be valuable in a students classroom for a couple reasons. One reason is because if a lesson is to boring then it could chnage it up to where you are having fun but still learning. Another reason to why the Facial Action Coding System should be valuable is because sometimes we have to pretend like we are fine when we aren't.

The Facial Action Coding System is a system that can caulate your emotions. Wouldn't it be couls if you could caculate your emotions like a math test? I think it would. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it tells us how you feel according to the face expression you do. For example, in the article its says when you raise your eyebrows it means you are surprised. The article also says when you force a smile or if you actually mean it.

When you fake smile your mouth is stretched sideways. When you actually want to smile the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth.

The Facial Action Coding System should be valuable in a students classroom because if you are trying to pay attention but it's to boring the computer will detect that and it could change it to where you are having fun but still learning. Another reason to why it could be helpful is because if you are becoming confused about the lesson or have a question about it the computer will also detect that and it could offer you extra help. Wouldn't it be nice to get extra help when you need it? I sure would like it.

Having the Facial Action Coding System could help when letting your feelings out. There are some people that have to pretend like everything is fine and pretend they are happy when they aren't. Like it was said in the article people often can tell how you feel with the face expression you have but they don't kmow if you are faking it.

People see you look happy so they never ask ""how are you doing?"" ""Can I help you with anything?"" so you have no one to talk to but with the new system it would be different.

There are other reasons to why the Facial Action Coding System should be valuable I just said a coulpe. I think the new system would really help out alot of people and not only in school but also outside of school also.     ",3,7,0.8050481081008911

Each expression is compared against a neutral face that shows no emotion. You can tell how someone is feeling simply by looking at their face.

The articles says ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". That is telling you how the computer would be able to detect your emotions. The article also says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". Meaning if you are happy and act like you are sad it can still tell that your happy.

The new computer technology can even identify mixed emomtions as well. The article claims that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face"", meaning showing no emotion. Therefore you can tell how someone you know is feeling with the new technolgy. Its all about the muscular units in your face that tells it all.

That is why i think that the new technology called facial Action Coding System is a good idea. it is something fun to do and help figure out what people are feeling. To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.

cb7e33d,"My Opinion on Facial Action Coding System

I would have to disagree with what the article is saying. Ok i get that technology is everything nowadays but this is a little to far. You might program it to have emotions,but its hard for the software to know what the person is feeling and understand how they feel. Its easy for a person to connect with another person because thats how they feel. Humans can usually give one another help and advice because they most likely have been through it themselves.

Its easy for a person to help and understand it because they understand the emotion that is happening to them. But when you just program something to have emotions its not the same. These people are writing emotional things and want people who understand that. It is very hard for a piece of software to understand that. If I had to write something very personal i would want someone who can relate to read it.

But it could be a good thing for the school because it could help the school know if the kid was upset or bad. The school could help the kid and figure out whats wrong. In paragraph 9 they gave you examples on good ways to tell if someone means the smile on there face. It has some pros but there are alot ot cons to it.

This article has alot of good points in it but I still dont agree with what it is saying. Science can be a good thing but I dont think science can be used and be helpful in this situation. Plus it uses the schools money and it can be used for better things. We can use our time and think of things and that would be useful.

In conclusion i think that this is useless. I totally disagree with what there saying and doing. Technology is soon going to be everything and we dont want that. Its like soon we are going to be run by robots. I just think we can use our time worrying about other things. I dont think this will help us at all in the future. ",3,7,0.8548645377159119

cc266ee,"Using Technology to Read Emotional Expressions

Using technology to show exactly how other people are feeling can be very valuable. New software has been developed and it can help determine how people are feeling based upon their facial expression. This is called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). FACS seems to be very promising for many different industries. Using technology like FACS would be a very valuable experience for students.

Calculating emotions is like math. The computer can recognize facial expressions and show others how someone really feels. This process starts by making a 3-D model of the face, and the muscles must move like human muscles. If these muscles function correctly this can be a very good learning opportunity for students to learn about facial muscles. This can also help them learn about facial expressions, how others are percieving their own facial expressions, and they can read each others facial expressions. Teachers could also benefit from this because then they could see how students are really feeling even if the student says they feel one way.

The reading states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" as I previously stated, this can help students learn about facial expressions and how everyone within a classroom can read each others facial expressions. The reading also states that you can probably tell how your friend is feeling based upon the look of their face. If students were able to use this type of technology some who do not understand could have a better understanding of how facial expressions work.

Each person uses different facial expressions to convey an emotion. To do this everyone must use certain muscles to display that emotion. In paragraph 9 of the reading it states that your facial muscles not only express emotions, but they help produce that emotion. This means that if you smile to show happiness then it can also help you produce that feeling. This evidence proves that this technology can be valuable in a classroom because if a student is sad that student can try to change how how they feel emotionally by producing facial expressions that are happy.

Using Facial Action Coding Systems would be very valuable for reading students' emotional expressions. It can help them understand how facial expressions work and how the differnt facial muscles affect them. This can also help some students who are unfamiliar with the topic become more familiar with it, and help them have a better grasp on the concept of FACS.

Someone who has emotional problems could benefit from this knowledge and this could teach them how they could improve how they are feeling, or other students could pick up on the problem. In conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding system would be a valuable learning experience for students because it can help them understand how expressions work and understand how others are feeling.

cc28ac9,"The FACS

could be valuable or untrustworthy. The system may be used to recognize facial emotions, but if the perosn is making a false facial expression the system might not be able to recognize the expression. Also some people show their emotions differently from one another. Some may smile when they're angry or frown when they're nervous.

Another problem is the system may not be able to detect the individuals expression do to their degree of expression. Some people only broadly smile when they're happy or only half grin.

But the system can be very valuable in the tracking of facial emotions/expressions. It can track mixed emotions on an individuals face. But even so you can never be a hundred percent certain of someone's exact emotions or feelings.

Sometimes people can detect feelings better than any software or system. A person can talk to someone with a happy facial expression but talk with an angry attitude. There can also be instinces where someone may be happy a lot and sad once in a while and are bad expressing it because they're always happy.

Overall, the system can be useful in measuring most facial expressions. But some just can't be deciphered because nobody can know exactly what an individual is feeling. There is no software available today to tell exactly what one is felling.   ",3,7,0.7949162125587463

The software explained that even though the picture makes it looklike the Mona lisa is happy, she wasn't all tht truthful of her emotions displayed in the picture.

Another example was that """"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" Observes Dr. Huang, ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of an expression.'' (like not smiling broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" the evidence explained that people are often times seen as displaying an emotion.

Of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, sad, etc."" The quote was stating that humans can calculate if one person is sad by saying ""what's the matter?"" or if they are happy, they ask what brought them in a good mood. Dr. Huang claimed thar ""Artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to display an emotion."" Even though most humans may have difficult knowing that said emotions are displaying (ex. Alexythmiacs or face blind people) they may depend on the software to help them understand what emotions are on display. Final piece of evidence stated that ""Most human communications are nonverbal, including emotional communication and that computers will need to understand that too. Your pc at home can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona lisa's smile."" A reason for that is that if a p[erson has a computer and has a look of discomfort, the computer will not really have the scanner to recognise what the person is feeling even if they want the computer to do so. In conclusion, The FACS can recognise anyones emotion with just a scan of the face, But it is good use to see if students will display anything when in the classroom. ",2,7,0.8527107834815979

One of them is the Facial Action Coding System also known as FACS, which technology could identify human emotions was created by Dr. Paul Eckman. In my opinion, I think this techonology is useful, especially in order to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future. The creation of FACS is a way to solve this problem, it could read student's thinkings, from that parents and teachers could understand about expected of their kids, or their students. Therefore, they could modify their ideas, lessons to able to suitable. It leads to success in learning of teachers and students; or it could make kids and parents get closer, and decrease the bad things happen.

The use of the technology can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It helps to understand students feelings, or reactions about the lessons, thus the teachers can recognize what are things helpful, and unhelpful. From that, the effective in studying will be increased. Besides that, it also brings advanges in communication between parents and child.

When students are feeling a certain way, it may affect their ablity to learn. By incorporating the use of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom, teachers or even the computers themsleves could alter the learning style of the information being taught, making it customized and fitting for a specific student based on their emotions.

Everyone is different when it comes to learning. Some students may be visual learners where as some students may be auditory learners. There are numerous, unique differences spanning from individual to indivdual which makes it hard on teachers when trying to teach a group of students the same material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System would make the job easier on teachers and prove helpful for students. For example, if a teacher could not visually recognize that one of thier students was tired, they may continue on with the way they are teaching the information, and that particular student may not grasp the concept being taught. With the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher would be able to recognize the students emotions and would have the opprotunity to alter her teaching method to somehting more engaging for the student. This would also prove helpful for the student that was feeling tired becasue they would now be able to become engaged with a modified style of learning.

If the Facial Action Coding System recognized that the students appeared to be happy and engaged, this could guide the teacher to continue teaching in that particular style and it would benefit the students trying to learn. Another way that this new technology could prove valuble in the classroom is if students were doing work on their computer or other elctronic device. If the Facial Action Coding System was installed into the learning devices that the students are using, the device itself could alter the learning style of the information given to fit the students needs. Even Dr. Haung, a professor at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Huang).

The Facial Action Coding System would prove to be valube and helpful in many ways when incorporated in the classroom. The use of this technology would allow teachers and electronic teaching devices to enhance their learning styles to attend to all different types of students. Often times teachers forget that some individuals learn differently than others and only focus thier course in one direction.

Other people can tell if you are happy or sad based on the way you present your body postion and face.

Modern day technology has made it possible for computers to interpret someones emotion based on their facial expression.

This technology could be used in a classroom and can work to help boost moral, keep the student more interested, and help the teacher relay a positive attitude to reproduce in their students.

Some days, when students go to school, they didn't get enough sleep, get a energetic breakfast, or are just simply not having a good day.

With this new Facial Action Coding System, teachers and other faculty in a school will be able to analyze what they can do to boost moral in the classroom.

If the teacher does a fun activity and the technology tells the teacher that the expressions on the students faces were happy, the teachers will know to do that activity to boost moral.

The technology will also be able to tell when the student does not enjoy the activity or experience, and the teacher can work on how to approach it differently the next time.

The teacher will get accurate results on how the students are feeling, which sometimes can be faked.

According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", smiles that don't use the obicularis oculi pars palpabraeus, or the muscles that make the crow's feet around your eyes, are not a genuine smile.

From this data a teacher can pull out who is fakeing, and who is not.

There are some subjects in school that students are just not interested in.

The teachers try different approaches, but sometimes nothing seems to work.

The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to detect what kids are interested in and what are not.

The article gives an example of if a computer ad pops on the screen and the reader smiles, then a similar one will appear the next time.

If the reader doesn't smile, an ad not as similar will pop up next time.

This tactic can be used in the classroom.

The computer can observe how a student reacts to playing a educational game, and pass on the information to the teacher.

If the game doesn't interest the student, the teacher needs to make improvements or find a new one.

If the student is interested, the teacher now knows that they can use it and it will be effective.

Some teachers have problems with how their students are reacting to their teaching, and find that it is how they present themselves.

If a teacher is boring, unorganized, and inequipped, the class will respond with a bored attitude.

On the flip side, if a teacher comes to class energetic, engaged, and prepared, the students will respond with a happier, more engaged, and often be more interested in the topic.

The phrase ""you fake it 'till you make it"" applies to this situation.

A drama coach, by the name of Constantin Stanislavsky, tought his actors how to carefully reproduce smiling and frowning based on the emotions that they presented on stage.

Teachers can use these methods in their classrooms to keep their students engaged and become interested in the topic even if the topic has nothing interesting about it at all.

Studies show that even if you force a smile, you will feel happier.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author describes how a new technolgy called Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions.

Humans can usally identify small things in their friends faces, but nothing to the degree that this new software has in store.

Using this software in computers in the classroom could mean that teachers could improve moral, keep students more interested and engaged, and reproduce positive attitudes and emotions.                ",4,7,0.8762208819389343
cd222a9,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Lisa smile never smiles she was 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful adn 2 percent angry. Well to to me she was most likely angry if she never smiled when using technology you need to make it have a tester that will know everything before making it I feel like they should make a robot but before putting it out have a tester. I see the author asked can we caculate emotions like math well when doing math you have to learn anf figure out well to find out how someone is feeling you have do all of that to get the answer.

The author also asked how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movmetns well by making a robot that is like a human but very 100 percent truth- 3-D.The author says the facial expressions of reach emotion are universal, well you wouldnt know that unless you make a robot and find out if it would work there shoukd be a tester before puting it our.

I see the author has said that we humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday but we human all are not the same it says we can probably tell how a friend is doing by how they face look well I walk around with a serious face people think im mad but im not see when you talk about doing all of this wanting to making things make sure you know what you talking about and that everything is working perfect.

If the technology gets made hopefully Lisa smile is 100 pecent happy. Teachers would need this just in case a student is mad and the teacher gets yelled at they would know like dang ok she or he is mad. So I think the technology should get made but before putting it out make sure it is working and that it tells the truth on how people is feeling and their emotions.",2,7,0.8016650676727295
cd65096,"The Facial Action Coding System I believe to be a great idea. The Facial Action Coding System begins when the computer construcrs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Using something like this could be good or bad, because maybe not all students or parents feel comfortable with teachers being able to read their childs emotions. Being able to read some students emotions may help with potential problems with the child to see how they are really feeling. One main reason I am for this invention is in paragraph 6 in the artical it says "" A classsroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", Dr. Huang predicts ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The Facial Acting Coding System might actually be more accurate than you think, because the creaters have thought ahead, maybe you're feeling a certain way but the computer say differently, or your exspressions for some emotions could be slightly different than oothers. Paragraph 4 in the artical "" even though individuals often shoe varying degrees of expression"" ( like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. In conclusion your home PC can't handle something as complex as decoding Mona Lisa's smile. But it can write down simple instructions that ""encode"" differnt emotions.",3,7,0.907825231552124
cddb65e,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" describes a new techology called the Facial Action Coding System(FACS for short), this system enables conputers to read facial expressions to identify human emotions. This program can be used in classrooms to find out when a student is bored or confuse, this can help teachers chage their lessons to something that can keep a students active and focased on there studies. As long as the software can only read emotions, read if a student is lying or not and make help make lessons more active, I am for its use in schools.

This program can only read six basic emotions- happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and each are associated with different characteristic movements. The way it reads your emotions is by constructing a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles in order for the program to read each emotion. In class this can be used to find confused and bored students and then help the teacher change the lesson so that they can understand it better or become more focased on the lesson. This can help effectively raise grades for students who are prone to becoming confused and bored.

Now this can also be used to figure out if a student or convict is lying or not. Muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Now if someone is fake smiling or keeping a strait face while lying the program can use that to help notify people if someone is lying or not.

The program can help make classes and students, more active and controlled. When knowing if a class is confused or bored can make a big diffence because the lesson or teacher can then be changed to the students likeing so the class can continue on focased and active. Which helps students whom are prone to get distracted.

As long as this program can help students in these ways than schools should invest in this program to keep their students active in their lessons. So then schools wont have to continue constanly be trying new things to figure out how to keep their active and focased. ",3,7,0.8712372779846191
ce0fa56,"Most would agree for FACS (FAcial Action Coding System) to be put into school programs to tell how students feel via emotions. But as a fellow student I am againts facial action coding system. The only reason to for me to be against is that each human expressses emotions differently. Some may express them but others prefer to keep their own emotions to themselves. Because if you read someones facial expressions in a classroom through FACS is basically an invasion of privacy. Having someone constantly tell what you're feeling, and having the power to read others as well.

""A classroom computer could recgnize when a student is becoming confused or bored Dr. Huang predicts"". That is the only facial expression I would agree to be read by FACS, In order to tell when a student is bored with homework or confused on a subject to help the teacher help their students when they feel those emotions. But using FACS to tell if a student is depressed, sad, angry, or happy is in my opinion an invassion of privacy. In the article it states ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"".

FACS can glady tell their emotions but not children. Because if used in our school programs, we are slaves of our own emotions. Some will try to hide their emotions but will be unable to. Most will not use any emotions while in school, in order to hide what they don't want seen. Using FACS in school to tell what emotions students are feeling shouldn't be used in my honest opinion.

FACS should be used differently In some other aspects. Such as ""The same technology can make computers-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery"". FACS should be used to better the world and the people living in it. Not using it to invade their lives, and telling what they feel.",3,7,0.8481972217559814
ce37922,"I would claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. i would like to help students with their problems like anger depresson and what ever they have. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would help with students' emotions. This software could indentify any emotion you have and the face exprestions you have and it would calculate ever days feeling.

First, it would indentify any emotion you have. Just like Mona Lisa they found out that she was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. ""The facial expressiions for each emotion are universal,""abserves Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression""(like not smiling as broadly). Dr. Huang used video imagery, and tracked the new emotion-recognition software and the facial movements. In the real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece) by weighting the different units in every expression is against a neutral face (showing no emotion)""

Finally, calculating your emotions. Are you asking yourself if the software can calculate emotiond like math homework? This process begins with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. The forty-four muscles in the modle mus move like human muscles. Dr. pual Ecjman has classified some basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with chracteristic movements of the facial muscles. An example they give is, ""Your frontalis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youre surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" Its pretty intrusting how it can determined your emotions.

My conclusion is that the technology to the software would be a great thing to use because it would helpin so many emotions and it would help students in so many ways. I think its intrusting in how Dr. Eckman invented the FACS and can determined in how students feel. ",2,7,0.8722755908966064

cf095da,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is an article in which the auother describes the new technology Facial Action Coding System. This newly invented technology can detect your mood just by your face. It constructs a 3-D computer model of your face, all 44 major muscles. Using this technology to read emtional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

In the article it said, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" When students are on a computer atempting a lesson, it can calculate their expressions and send feedback to the teacher. If the teacher wants to, they can modify the lesson if the feedback wasn't good. For example, the students can frown if they don't like it, and smile if they do. It's a good way for a teacher to get feedback of what the students actually think.

Most schools are turning to you do everything on computers. Some schools make it where you have to purchase a computer and you take it home. They don't have to buy textbooks, everything is just on the computer. When you miss a day because of snow you aren't actually missing a day. You do the lesson for that day on Elearn at home and you don't have to make up that snow day. Even at home you can get feedback from students because they do their lessons on their computers. You can learn a lot from facial expressions and Facial Action Coding System is a good way for teachers to learn what students like and what they don't, even from home.

Some people will argue that students won't be truthful and they will just make it a joke. The Facial Action Coding System can tell if you are being truthful or not. For instance, the article says, ""in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways, using the sygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Faces don't lie. These muscles are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is being truthful.""

The Facial Action Coding System is a good way for teachers, principals, and guidance counselars to get feedback. It's valuebale in the classroom as well as outside. Maybe the next move is putting it in big cooperations or little companies!           ",4,7,0.8056517839431763
cf315d3,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. These computers can actually ""calculate"" your emotions. Dr. Paul Eckman is the creater of the Facial Action Coding System. Dr. Eckman classified it in six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are calculated by facial expression, the movement of the muscles on our face. This seems quite very interesting and out of the ordinary, but would the use of this new technology to read student's emotional expressions be valuable in a classroom?

In my opinion, yes. This technology could really help the comprehension and learning of students because as the author mentions the prediction of Dr. Huang in paragraph six, ""A classroom computer could recognize when is student is becoming confused or bored,"" and this is exactly true because if teachers could recognize the students emotions then they can also modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, which the author also mentions. When we think of the word ""communication"" we automatically think ""talk"" and that is not quite right, because how the author also mentions towards the end of paragraph six, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" so knowing this fact, how would we expect for students to speak up and ask questions about a lesson they are confused about?

I would also like to mention is that if we had this new technology teachers would know what is wrong with a student. A lot of times students are going through things at home, which could keep them distracted in class. If teachers know the student is angry or sad, the teacher could have a talk with him or her. Get it out of their mind and try to keep them as best concentrated in the lesson as possible. Teachers would also be able to see who isn't concentrating and call them out in class to get their attention.

In conclusion, these computers could help so much because teachers never know how that student is really feeling, we could think their head is down because they are feeling sick but maybe they're just sad or angry. They also could tell if they're confused and simply try to teach the lesson another way around. Maybe the student is feeling ""fear"" to ask a question about something he or she is confused about because they'd feel embarrased infront of their classmates. Whatever the case is, this new technology would really be valuable in a classroom, and it could help the school community in general, making it more easy for teachers to teach and mainly for students to learn.

taking about Eckman i classified some basic emotions too people now are bored, sleeping, stress, sad, and fear because they want to pass the test and do good this work everyone has something in hi's face.

The facial expressions shows some emotional like happy , anger ect.

every day we have differnt caract or diferent emotional feeling and i don't know how Monna Lisa can be really intended tom bring a smile for us face. i thonk i cant recognize how my best friend feeling is just lokking her eyes cause i know her i and I know when she is happy, sad, bored, confusedand fear, I think people show the feelings but some people can's see because they don't care about it. I think that techonology is a great idea for us or some people who want to know feeling about some people important in their life. I think every emotional has one special moment sometimes are not special but its life and we can't do something abou it. Sonetines we have mixed of emotions like the Monna Lissa. She look happy but at the same time serious. Her smile look like different she can't smile like us. The reson of that is now she is just a painting. Leonardo da Vinci's paint the Monna Lisa but he die that the reason she doens't have the aye browns and thats why she sook serious. That is the reason she look like with different emotional feeling cause she don't have eye browns and she look likr that. we can see the movements in the people face and we can take an idea of how they are or how feeling and emotional are the face show everything. My conclussion is everyone have different emotional but if we want to know their feeling or emotional we need to stay with that person we need to meet the people spend time with him/her we can't say oh I need that techonology to see my wife feeling or my husband felling or a fried I mean is a good techonology but we need to spend time with the person the techonology can't do everything to us. We have the option let the techonology do that for us or do that for people if we really care about his feeling or emotional. For me the better option is the second one meet the people and ask some question to show the special boy or girls they are special for me and i want know more about him.

cf7d5ce,"Imagine being in a classroom that moniters your every emotion, where even if you are paying attention, the teacher would think you are not. For students, this would be a tough world to live in. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the auther Nick D'Alto writes in a way that gives an impression that the Facial Acting Coding System is perfect; however, the truth is far from it.

The author makes a series of points to show why this Facial Action Coding System would work well, and its many uses in a classroom. On the other hand, the author does not address the Facial Action Coding System's shortcomings. In the first paragraph, the author says that the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The question arises: how is it possible to be happy and angry at the same time? Machines can not, and will never be able to understand a human mind, and a human heart. Students in classrooms will not appreciate this technology because it will convey emotions differenct from what the students are actually going through.

In paragraph 3, the author describes how the machine picks up on emotions of people. The author says that he has classified six basic emotions. However, there are a vast majority of emotions that are not included in the Facial Acting Coding System. For example, what would the results looks like if someone feels jealous? Furthermore, the author says the emotions are associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.Therefore, the results would be squewed if one or more of the facial muscles are used to express two completely different emotions. Students could be accused of being sad, while in actuality, they are just tired.

In paragraph 4, the author says that even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, the facial expressions for each emotion are universal. Again, the Coding System only uses 6 emotions, so it can not be accurate. The author also says that the software can identify mixed emotions, but fear and happiness can not be mixed emotions. Hence, the Facial Action Coding System is not accurate.

In paragraph 5, the athor says that humans would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happiness. This is because humans don't assume what a person is thinking, but the Facial Acting Coding System will and since the system will not be accurate, it could wrongly accuse an innocent person of an emotion.

Paragraph 6 talks about computers being able to understand emotional communication, while paragraphs 7 and 8, shows us how to encode a smile. By following the three steps given, it is farely easy to fake what the machine would think is a genuine smile. Computers may be able to read certain emotions, but humans can always outsmart them. The Facial Action Coding System is going to be a huge waste of money if it is employed in schools because students will find ways to deceive the system.

Lastly, paragraph 9 tells us that humans unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. With that being said, if someone shows a certain emotion, people that see that emotion would imitate it. This further skews the results of the Facial Action Coding System.

The Facial Action Coding System is simply not accurate; it does not cover a wide range of emotions and it can simply be deceived. Furthermore, students would unconsciously imitate other students, which would the Facial Action Coding System would interpret as an emotion. Hence, there is no value in using the Facial Action Coding Sytem to read students' emotional expressions.",4,7,0.8658815622329712
cfa2cd5,"In this essay in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System I was talking about how are the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

First on that time some computers are creating to recognice emotions, in the text say, "" Mono Lisa at least acccording to some new computer software that can recognize emotions."" She was according that she wanted to find ways to humans express they emotions, but later the Dr. Huang was developed a betters ways to humans can be communicate with others. In the text say, "" Dr. Huag and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humas and computers to communicate"" this mean that the Dr. Huag he is trying to find how calculate the feelings of humans and he is a expert at developing a computers that way people will be have how they communicate with others to the place and another pleace.

In addition this process begins with a cumputer 3-D this was called an "" action unit"" this is how they is trying to find how are the humans emotions. The Dr. Paul Eckman was a creator the FACS ( Facial Action Coding System) he creater this, then he classified whats are the emotions that he is trying to has. In the text say, Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic of the facial muscle."" This mean how the Dr. Paul uses this six category to see how the students express their emotions. I think that this is help us because they know when the students are sad, fear, happy , anger or samething like the Dr. Paul saids. These emotions is classified to find the emotions of people.

Now the new emotion they use in people and then they compare with the real face , in the article say, "" Using video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa,"" and "" Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" they use videos imagery to show the emotions when they use the creation that they creater to see how are the ractions, and then they compared against the neutral face with the face that they have.

Also there is a lot ways that they have to use in emtions but not all the ways are express the same ways. Some ways that they use are bad beacuse some humans don't wanted that people know their life and another humans wanted that they help them to find their emotions because they don't know how they feel or how are their emotions.

When they uses with students is so confused for them. Students is becoming confused how Dr. Huag predicts, in the article say, "" A classroom computer could recognized when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Haug predicts. "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The same make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" this mean that for some students are boring but fr the others students are good and they used one and other ways to recognize the emotions and finally they found and they know when the students used a lot the computers to compared animated face or something like that.

In conclusion I learn that they are different ways to humans express their emotions that is hard for the Drs. to find the emotions for recognize how humans feeling. Also this ways a lot of students use to compared their emotions with someone else.     ",2,7,0.7831767797470093

I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions because the author gives a lot of detail from the texts and lets us know that ""the software can even identify mixed emotions."" It even lets us know that each expression is compared against a neutral face.

For an example, you can most likely tell how you're friend is felling simply by there look on his or her face. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" They even let us know that his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrikling at the corners of your eyes Finally raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes.

The last thing is that in the end of the text it let's us know that the author says ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

cff4abf,"Whats the Facial Coding System you asked ? What does it do ? how does it help ? there are many questions for this new software that was invented by Dr. huang. The FACS is a software that dectect the feelings that a person have at that moment from their muscles. Many people have more questions to ask about the FACS that will be answered later in the story.

""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". How did they find that out it starts off when the comuter creates a 3D model of the face and its speaks about what is going on throught that persons head. The software can identify mixed emotions cause each expression is compared against a nuetral face which is showing no emotion. Do you think that the FACS could be used in a classroom ? is it a good idea? I honeslty feel like it would be a waste of time because i dont see how determining feelings have anything to really do with school. I feel like its losing money when there are things that the kids could use on the laptop and computers that will further their education in being better in a subject.

We are all humans all of us make the same facial expressions not much of our expressions change from one another. By us just looking at a close friend we know when theres a problem when they happy, mad and sad so why would we need a system for it to tell us that. "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" says Dr. Hang so if we could have emotional communication can the comuters have the same thing. Communication is always key but having to use a system to detect a persons feelings when they could just tell us. The FACS in school I just dont see where does it fit in with education.

If FACS was to be in schools what would it be teaching children? will they find it interesting. the things that are taught in school are taght for a reason and a software that just shows emotions I dont see anything that the kids will be learning from that. I feel like if FACS on a school computer or laptop on a software it should be more of a activity than something they are just learning. I think the kids would enjoy for it to be a activity for high school it would be a big difference because people have careers and finding out emotions and what people are thinking would be a great idea to use FACS as a software.

""humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday"" although we do have the same expressions when we do things but a person dont even know when their showing an emotion when doing it. only your close ones would really know how you would feel about something but moral of the story i feel FACS would be great for high school for those who would like to have a career that involves more with knowing a persons feelings.

d0127a0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author introduces a new form of technology, the Facial Action Coding System. The new technology allows computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology will not be valuable to students in a classroom because it will be expensive, communication skills will be lost, and technology is not always accurate.

As it is now, without this new technology, some schools barely have enough money to buy basic supplies needed to provide a proper education for the students. If the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is added in the classrooms it will be another expense that is not neccessary. In the passage it says, ""Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisas smile."" This statement implys that, in order to use FACS, the school will have to buy not only the software, but also new computers that will support the system. That is a lot of money spent on unneccessary items when it could be spent on the basic supplies that most schools can barely provide now.

In today's world communication skills are bad enough already, with the current technology that students are surrounded by each day. In the passage it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" If the new technology is added into the classrom and, to a point, taking the place of a teacher, communication skills will be further taken away. Teachers teach more than just science, math, or english to the students. Having a teacher in the classroom also teaches students how to communicate properly with adults and how to carry on mature conversations. Taking away that human interaction will have a negative effect on the students.

Technology is not always accurate. If this software makes an appearance in classrooms and students start using it, it could give false information. The pasage states, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Each person's face is compared to the exact same neutral face, which will not be accurate. Each person has a different neutral face, so in order for the information to be correct, it will need to be compared against each person's neutral face.

There are multiple reasons that the new software will not be beneficial to students in the classroom, however, there are a couple reasons that the technology will be valuable. In the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" The computers telling the teacher that the student is confused could be beneficial because most students will not tell the teacher if they are confused, which causes them to get bad grades if they do not understand the material. If the teacher knows that the student is confused, they can take actions to make sure that they help them understand. Later in the passage it says, ""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" The new technology could help students understand and have empathy, which will be a good thing. Lots of people do not have a lot of empathy in today's world, which is part of the reason why the world is a very cold place. Students having empathy could result in everyone treating each other better, if they can try to understand the things that their peers are feeling.

Overall, FACS will cause people more trouble and headaches than anything. After considering both sides of the argument, it is safe to say that the new technology will not be beneficial to students in the classroom because of the combination of it being expensive, taking away communication skills, and not always being accurate.

d018ccb,"Students go to school everyday,and throughtout

their day their mood and emotions can change. Ever wondered what their emotions was? No need to worry anymore there is a new technology that has just came upon us. Its called a Facial Action Coding System which allows computers to identify human emotions. Which is a stupid tool to be used in a classroom.

The FACS or readers reading this know it the Facial Action Coding System in my opinion is a not a tool that should be used in classroom for many reasons why. One of those reasons is that students go through various amounts of emotions in a day. One minute they can be happy then the next minute they can be upset. I feel as if it would be too time consuming for teachers to stop class and run a students face through a computer program to get how they are feeling. That would take away learning time not just for the child that is getting his face scan but the other kids in the classroom who would have to wait while the teacher runs the childs face.In paragraph three we can see that the process might take some time to do when the author says,"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscless this in the model must move like human muscles."" This shows that before you can even run the test the computer must be a model of your face which will add on to time.

Also another reason that the Facial Action Coding System shouldn't be used in classrooms is because its not gonna change the emotion of the kid. The teachers spends all of that time scanning a student face to get his emotion for no reason at all. Wether or not the kid is mad,sad,or whatever the case may be it won't change how her or she is feeling.

At the end of the day the FACS should not be allowed in classrooms.It takes away valuable time in the learning enviroment of a classroom. Not only that but it doesn't improve the mood of the child. The Facial Action Coding System is a pointless tool in a classroom because it doesnt help to improve anything or anyone.   ",3,7,0.865591824054718
d093ede,"In this story about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" They talked about alot. In the first two paragraphs they talked about Face Expressions. Dr. Huag and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. They can caculate Emotions like a math homework. How can a computer recognize subtile facial movements we humans use to Express ourselves.

Then it gets into Facial Expressions that could be recognized. In this paragraph it said ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeeling simply by the look on their face"". Some people havr a natural mean look and some have no expression. Dr. Huag predicts that a calssroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused. He says the same technology can make computer amimated faces more expressive live video games, video surgery.

While looking in the mirror they give instrctions on how to make a smile. 1. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. 2. Then squint your eyes slightly, they will like like crows feet at the corner of your eye. 3. Hold all of that and then raise the outer parts of your cheeks up towards your eye. Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?

A Facial Feedback tells the person emotions. You could make a smilling face but are you really happy? Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but help produce them. People actually practice smiling and frowning on stage for them to create emotions. Whoevere would oof knew that making faces would reveal sos much about the science of emotions.

My conclusion of this that i never knew computers could caculate your expression. I could look and tell something is wrong with him or her by their facail expression. I could here their emotions through their voice not their face too much. You couldn't do this back then about 20-50 years ago because we didnt have thi much of technology. Now that we do its so much you can do with it.",1,7,0.8338617086410522
d0a6d84,"Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 perccent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The softweare is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleage are experts at developing better ways for humans to communicate.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major musceles in the model, Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness with each characteristic movements of the facial muscles, your front lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eye brows and when you're surprised; your obicurlaris oris (around your mouth) would tighten your lips to show anger.

d0b5ffb,"Peoples emotions can be hard to detect most times. Personally, my friends have gotten very good at faking emotions. Detecting how someone really feels in nearly impossible for the human brain. For example, in the article it states that the Mona Lisa is, ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" Being able to detect all of those emotions in just looking or talking to someone just isn't as easy as it seems. Thats why they came up with ""the Facial Action Coding System."" This system has been developed to improve the accuracy in perceiving ones emotions.

Frst, the way this system will work is when the computer constructs a 3-D compter model of a face. The computer will be able to detect the emotion of a person when they see the muscles in their face. To be able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom will be very benificiary when it comes to how they feel about the thing the school is teaching them. If we continue to advance in technology like we have, then using the computers for lessons will be able to detect weather the child is interested or not. The article states that, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomming confused or bored."" That way when a child is confused, for those who are too scared to ask for help, the teacher could be alerted and try their best to help the child or maybe even change lessons.

Secondly, the computer system could also be very helpful in a school because of teenage kids and their problems. If a student is feeling very down, then the computer could detect that and try to get help for them. In the world today there are many kids who suffer from depression and anxiety, sometimes school can be too much for them. Therefore, when doing school work if the computer can detect the sadness or overwhelming confusion causing their anxiety to rise it could help them out a lot. The article states that, ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth, while a fake smile the mouth is stretched sideways, using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This would help the computer detect kids from being actually happy, or just faking it for everyone else.

Third, the computer system could help with kids who struggle with anger. Maybe school makes them angry, or they struggle with the work. With the school fights in the past, and future, i belive this would help detect how kids feel. The computer could watch what the child proceeds to look up on the internet, while also detecting how the child feels. This way, if a child shows signs of harm to themselves or to others, the computer could inform the school and try to give help to the kid. I believe this would only improve the safety of schools while also offering help to the ones that need it.

Fourth, I believe the computer system could help those of us who tend to get very bored or tired. This way when a child is bored or tired the teacher has a way of fixing the problems, or doing more interesting ideas to help you stay focused. Personally, i tend to get very bored when school comes up to topic, so if my teacher had a way of making it interesting for me that would be awesome! I also tend to get very tired so if my teacher is alerted of a child getting sleepy, we could do exercise or stretches to help wake us up.

This computer system would help school coorporations tremendlously because of all the problems kids go through. I believe that every school computer should have this sytem, because i think the techers could have a chance to keep children interested and awake. This could possibly improve attendance and graduation percetages. Getting a kid engaged and interested can be very difficult but i belive this stystem would help a lot! As the article states, "" Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!"" Truly amazing and helpful!",5,7,0.9102184176445007
d0f0e91,"Guessing how someone is feeling is hard sometimes which can make it difficult for people to connect with eachother. If we only knew someone's feelings, we could improve how we communicate with people and how productive we are.That can all change with the new technology that can read the emotional expressions of humans. The new technology called Facial Action Coding System, made by Prof. Thomas Huang, can change the lives of students drastically. The use of this technology is valuable in classrooms because it can make it easier for students to process information and keep the students engaged.

Students will be able to learn a lot with the help of FACS because of the way the information is displayed and taught. In paragraph 6 of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it says "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" If a student was getting tired of the lesson, FACS could detect that the student is losing interest. So, it could change the format of the information and keep the student focused and keep going during the lesson. This will help students a lot on understanding the knowledge that is being given to them because not everyone learns the same way.

The emotions of humans can be hard to detect because most people don't want to verbally communicate or some don't know how to. Students can feel good or relieved if there is a lesson that is not stressing them out and that can actually make information more understandable. Also in paragraph 6 of the article, it says "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that too.' "" Some students may have trouble talking to teachers or asking questions about certain information. With FACS, they no longer have as much anxiety when learning which keeps the student from drifting off. The FACS will be able to keep the students engaged in the information because it is going into their head

more easily and it's less stressful.

Some might be against this innovative technology and argue that students might not learn as well or they might have a decrease in social and verbal skills. The thing is that it will help all students learn because everyone is different and the FACS will allow different students to be exposed to different formats of information. Since lessons could be modified, it will be more understandable for students to process given information. With FACS, students won't be as pressured and can actually be interested in the lessons because it is the best fit for them.

In conclusion, FACS is valuable for students because it will help them improve their understanding of new information and keep them interested. Thus, the FACS would also benefit their mental state because they are considering emotions of kids which could be hard to tell sometimes. FACS could be a new beginning for schools to improve education and engage students in lessons. ",4,7,0.8722987174987793
d136a52,"The Vaule or No Vaule in the Facial Coding System

What is the point in the facial coding system? If you think about it what can it be used for in our daily lives. Or what affect does it have towards us if we use it today. The facial action coding system is a new software thats developed to improve accuaracy in perceiving the emotons of others. Although, it seems that it might have a value, but in reality it does not because three reaosn on why it's not vauleable is because money is being wasted towards an invention that will not be used, if they are trying to hide their emotions what is the point in making it if they do not want to show them for a reson so they should not be forced to use it, and how can you porve it is accurate how would you ever know if that is really how you feel when it shows you because your the only one that knows how you really feel.

First reason on why its not vauleable is because money is going to be wasted toward something that will not be used in future. Instead of using money on things like this sytem and adding more unuseful things on this world.

Maybe we should invest on a invetion that would be an affect in our lives and would benifit us in a postive way. Yeah it may be cool to mess around with a system like this for fun but using the money wisely is better on using it on soemthing that is not uselful. For an example making or putting in moremoeny to help get more supplies to discover more ways in finding a cure for cancer.

A second reason on why its not vauleable is because if someone is trying to hide their emotions its for a reason. Why should soemone be forced to use this sytem when they do not want to express how they feel. Most of the time poeple do not show on how they feel towards things that they do not show no face expessions. But on the other hand if you are in a good mood I would understand on why you would want to try it. But if you are in a situation that is putting you down but not wantng to express it. Then why make it harder on them and make them feel even worse because their emotions are being out there and seen by others when that is what they do not want.

A the third reason on why its not vauleable is because how can you prove it is accurate. How would you ever know if that is really how you feel when it shows you because your the only one that knows how you really feel. Yeah it may take the 44 major muscles in your face and recognize an expression. But is it really accurate? There really is not a percentage of feelings you can have. It is just how you feel. A machine should not be telling you that you feel 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 pecent fearful, and 2 percent angry. You should just be able to determine yourself and express or know how you feel cause they are your own emotions. You do not need the facial coding system to tell you.

What is the point in the facial coding system? The system does not have an affect on us that would be valueable. Although, it seems that it might have a value, but in reality it does not because three reaosn on why it's not vauleable is because money is being wasted towards an invention that will not be used, if they are trying to hide their emotions what is the point in making it if they do not want to show them for a reson so they should not be forced to use it, and how can you porve it is accurate how would you ever know if that is really how you feel when it shows you because your the only one that knows how you really feel.

Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness; yes it is like the that one movie we've all seen Joy. Even the smallest smile you give can indecate how you are feeling.

Or some people don't even have a smile and people think that they are mad even though they could be happy, some people just don't like showing it.

There are many reason why people may not like showing how they really feel, some people don't like showing it because they may think they look weak. It is fine showing your emotions. Maybe they can let people know how they are feeling and it will get a lot better to let everything out, some kids don't like telling their parents how they feel, so maybe they can talk to a teacher who they actually trust.

With new technology called FACS(Facial Action Coding System), it will be able to detect when kids are feeling this way.

The computer makes a 3-D model face of a human and have all 44 major musles that operates like human musles, then it scans the face of a real human which will then identify what the person is feeling right now such as happy, sad, tired, scared and many more. Using this type of technology will be very helpful in classrooms because when a student is feeling bored or tired then the computer will be able to detect that the the teacher will be able to make the topic more interesting for the students. Most teachers have about 28 students per class for seven periods everyday which can be very stressful, so it can be very challenging for them to recognize when students are dealing with a certain type of emotion but with the FACS it can recognize that and the teacher will be able to help the student or students.

In conclusion, FACS is an amazing creation that will be able to help students and teachers. Kids learn the most when they're happy and when the subject they're learning is fun and very interesting and when they're in a good environment. With FACS, it not only detects a humans emotion but it will be able to communicate with a teacher to notify them when a kid is not doing well.           ",2,7,0.8592888116836548

Most humans tend to not stay engaged in something if they aren't having fun. The software would be able to make the lesson more engaging and would want students to learn more.

""Empathy (feeling someone else's emtional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression""(Ph9), when the author states this it shows that not all of our humanliy facial expressions give off our emotions.

The system of recognizion is based to describe your emotions on certain things like as, if someone is not feeling well or if they need help with their work. We as humans, have a different variety of emotions that we can easily detect just by looking at their face. Most people will have the same face reaction all day meaning, if someone has a angry face and someone ask him if everything is ok, his respond is yes, is that his emotions and feelings do not interacts with his face reaction. In the Mona Lisa smile you can see like a pervert smile but at the same time, an inoccent. Determining different emotions associated with the facial muslces can truly help teachers to ditermine basic and normal emotions but also to see mixed emotions.

d227acb,"Have you ever wondered what someone else was feeling on the inside? With the introduction of the Facial Action Coding System; this allows you to do just that by having it interpate someone's facial expressions, and then having it respond back with a variety of emotions from that specific person. The Facial Action Coding System should be enabled across the United States since the mechanism allows you to figure out what someone is feeling at a given time and since it allows an instructor to make alternative lessons if their students are proven bored from FACS.

Firstly, the FACS does not allows students to hide themselves and pretend to be someone they are not. The FACS will pick up emotions that a student is feeling and teachers, parents, and or consoulers will be able to get the help that that particular student aqquires. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This same concept can work with students too. If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System can change the way lessons are tought to make them more encaging and exciting for students. If the FACS picks up that students are bored out of their minds; instructors will be able to change the lesson for future students so that they are paying attention and actual learning from the lesson. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" and ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This example from the text illustrates that the FACS will have have a trememdous effect on students' learning capabilities in a good way because with the FACS; instructors can modify their lessons so that students can obtain information better and learn more from their class. If the students are learning more from classes with the effect of FACS; this world will have a brighter future because the students now across American are the world's future, and with brighter students comes a brighter future.

In conclusion, FACS should be incooperated in all classrooms nation wide because how many times are a kid did you tell you parents at the dinner table that you did not learn anything at school? With the FACS that topic at dinner can be changed because the FACS can modify lessons if the students are bored or confused so that students develop more information in a days work at school. The able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is also valuble because if a student is struggling with mental problems, rather than being bored or confused, the FACS can detect what he or she is feeling and that particular student can get the help he or she needs to succeed in life. As one can see, the FACS would be an incredible improvement in all classrooms across American and over seas because with the effects of the FACS students will be able to learn and take away more from a lesson than before.

With the new technology that Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman are developing, you can tell how your friend in schools are feeling. In the article, they said, ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" The technology can give you way more details that just saying ""mad"", ""happy"", or ""sad"".

Another reason why the technology will be good in school is because the students can also tell how the teacher is feeling towards them or the lesson. The student will be able to tell if the teacher is bored or having fun, when they're not showing it. For example, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcuding emotional communication."" Sometimes the teacher doesn't verbally say how thye are feeling.

d254bc7,"The use of Facial Action Coding System provides insight to the many complex emotions we use every day, and it also has many hidden uses. The Facial Action Coding System would be very important to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom for two main reasons, detecting our true emotions and modifying what information we will see.

The first reason that shows how FACS will be valuable in classrooms is that this new technology can detect our true emotions while we may be unable to. Paragraph five shows how real people can probably tell how others are feeling by only seeing the look on their faces, while we would have trouble actually describing why we came to that conclusion. While in paragraph three it is shown that FACS uses the work of psychologists that classifies the association of emotions and their distinct movements of facial muscles. This is important because the raw ability of FACS compared to normal students and teachers is far greater because it uses information that they most likely don't have access to.

The final reason FACS will be important in classrooms is that it will be able to adjust the information we recieve according to our current emotion. Paragraph six provides a situation where a computer will know when you are happy or sad and uses that information to decide what the next ad will be. Another situation is provided where a classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored, and then modify the lesson accordingly.

FACS does still have to prove itself; just the use of it in a classroom may offend people. Some people may be bothered with having some computer program analyze their face and categorize their childrens' emotions, as of today some people don't really like to be put into categories. However, when they see the positives of its use in classrooms and that there is no malicious intent, they will soon begin to appreciate it.

In short, FACS has many different uses that can cater to both students and teachers, as it can adjust to our specific needs at that moment.

The integration of FACS into classrooms will be extremely valuable as it will bring more flexibility and bring insight into all classrooms around the world.            ",4,7,0.8664518594741821

In conclusion it is better to have a computer to help us create a emtion reading enviorment. It can help us in many ways and make the world more happy. This way would be so much better to show the way a mind works and help mpre scientist undrstand the brain. This can even lead to more dsicoveries that us human haven't reached yet and maybe make us a smarter country in return.       ",3,7,0.6016923189163208
d272aa9,"I think that this is pretty cool to be able to read for face experssions. Like you can tell if someones happy or mad by a computer just reading your face. It can tell because how your cheek bone and moves one way and they can tell your emotions. Its crazy too how fare we came to be able to have a computer be able to tell if your mad or sad or any emoetions you have. So I think its a good idea to have to something that able to do something like this.

I think this is a cool thing that your able to do like how they knew Mona Lisas emetions. How she was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". There will still be people like how they are in paragraph 2. ""How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movement we humans use to express how we feel?"". I think alot of people will like it because its something so cool and new and everyone would want to go try it out and go buy one to do it. ""The faical exoressions for each emotion are universal.

Its something thats really cool alot of people and little kids would like it. Everyone would want to try and see what their emotions say. So if they did come out with something like this alot of them would sell quick and i know they wont be cheap. We have came so fare from having to wait 5 minutes to take a picture to now being able to tell a persons emotions by a computer just reading there face.    ",2,7,0.8095409870147705
d29cf7f,"Imagine being able to know a person exact emotions even if they are trying to hide them. A sotfware made by Thomas Huang can do just that! With just a simple look at your face it can detact all 44 major muscles. the sotfware is called Facial Action Coding System or FACS for short. Now if we could bring this in to the class rooms it could chang the way we learn.

To explain in depth if we where to have this system in a class rooms it would help students learn. ""If you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" this would help in class because if a student gets confused or bored the system would be able to pick that up and change the lesson to make it more enterating or easier to understand. witch would make this system so effective with everday learning. This syatem could also be helpful for teachers to be able to tell if a student is not felling well or needs some time to him/her self. The best part about the system is that it is all nonverbal, so there are no words needed for the shy people that struggle when asking for help or feel ebrassed to. when all said and done there are many wasys this system can be effective to all kinds of people in school.

Emotion make up a big part on how our day will go and what we will do throught that day. there is a unique system that can read emotion and that can work arounrd that. To illustrate my point emotions is what makes up who we are and shape us as a whole wouldn't you wanna know how you acutal feel and all your peers?  ",3,7,0.8132624626159668
d2d423b,"In the classroom, a teacher may not be able to fully understand and realize the feelings and emotions of the students in their classroom. The teacher will not be able to meet with every single one of their students to make sure that they are doing okay and understand everything in class. However, with the Facial Action Coding System, things may change. The Facial Action Coding System is extremely valuable in the classroom because it may allow teachers to focus more on students that are confused, sad, angry or fearful. Furthermore, the system can be used to make sure everyone understands what the teacher is teaching at their own pace.

First, the Facial Action Coding System can help students learn at their own pace. The computer would be able to recognize whether a students thought the subject was too easy or too hard by their countenance. For example, in the text, Dr. Huang predicts,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" So, since a teacher usually teaches everything at the same time, these computers may be better because some students excel where other students don't. These computers would help the excelling students have a constant challenge while students that take time could slowly grasp and understand a particular subject or idea. Evidently, the Facial Action Coding System is something that can be valuable to a class and help everyone learn comfortably.

Another benefit from the Facial Action Coding System is that the technology could inform teachers on how their students are feeling. In the article, Dr. Paul Eckman associated six basic emotion- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness- to specific facial muscle movements. Through this technology, the teachers may be able to help support students that are feeling sad, angry, or fearful. The teachers would be able to become a counselor figure for those students that are feeling unpleasant emotions and help them overcome the difficulties that they are having. Through the removal of unpleasant emotions in the classroom, all the students can be happy and work together to bring knowledge and success into their lives.

Also, the Facial Action Coding System could help create a classroom atmosphere in which all students feel welcome and happy. To certain students, the way they like to learn or study may be different than how other students may. To solve this, a teacher could try out different types of classroom settings, lesson plans, activities, etc. Then, the technology could help the teacher determine what the students liked the most by their facial analysis. This could help create a classroom where all the students are having fun and engaging with the subject rather than being bored and reluctant to study.

In addition, this type of technology could help provide a safe learning environment for students. Through this technology, teachers could see students that are feeling malicious and angry, which would allow them to prevent future problems or consequences by helping them through couseling. If teachers were not able to understand or see the feelings of a very angry and upset student, consequences could occur such as fighting and misconduct. So, the Facial Action Coding System can also provide safety to students and teachers alike.

Some critics of the Facial Action Coding System may say that a student has their right to their own personal feelings. However, although it may cost a minute amount ot privacy, the Facial Action Coding System may save many lives. For example, by knowing a student is sad, teachers would be able to prevent suicides by giving emotional support and making sure everything is safe. In addition, teachers could help prevent child abuse or bullying by knowing if a student is constantly showing fear. Preventing the abuse or bullying of students could prevent a gruesome future and allow them to pursue their dreams and be themselves without fear.

The benefits of the Facial Action Coding System substantially outweigh the negative aspects. The Facial Action Coding System may be the key to successful education where all the students grow in knowledge while having fun and actively enjoying the subject. The teacher may also be more aware of what is going on in the classroom through this technology, allowing them to meet individual needs of their students. Because of the benefits that would come from such a technology, the Facial Action Coding is a valuable tool for the students and the teacher in a classroom.",6,7,0.8468022346496582

I dont think that this is very vauluable for students because some people may feel that they are happy but the computor may say they are diffrent because of the way they controll there emotions.

The computor is supposed to read your mood by scanning facial exspressions but some people have difrent ways of reactiong to the way they feel.

What if the computor had read your mostly hapy but inside you feel that you are angry, sad, or confused. I do think in some places there could be something like this but do not see the use for it in a school.

Most of the time young kids and teenagers will say how they feel and explain why without asking them.

I dont see the need to hae a achine in school for students to be able to tell what there own or someone elses mood is.

The computor could be easly tricked into thinking that your mood is the opposite of what you are actually feeling.

If the computor goes by facial movement then someone could easly smile at the computor and make it think that they are happy. The computor may work in some situations but is thee proof that people cant make a diffrent face to maybe trick or comfuse the computor

into beliving that you are feleng something that you are not.

Although I dont find this computor helpfull in a persons life I do find it interesting.

The computor is obviously very persice when the picture or human displayed to it is actually makeng the emotion they feel or maybe not making any faces at all. But theres nothing saying that it wont read correctly if someone makes a didfrent face or acts a diffrent way thatn they usally do.

I feel that the computor will be pretty neat and may be usefull in some situations. As the technology progresses in the mzking of the computors I think things could possibly change and make to where you cant trick the computor as easly and the computor is always acurate. At this stage I feel it could be very usefull in some situations in the future.    ",2,7,0.806167483329773

If a person was told to follow those instructions wouldn't that be considered a forced smile. What if a student has a bad day during school and in a lab they have to follow these instuctions in a mirror that would be a foced smile. I think that we should not deal with others emotions or try to figure them out because it there life and if they want to let there emtions out they can.

The first line of the article says, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This is the article speaking about Mona Lisa's facial expression in the famous painting. The article goes on to speak of the process.

They say the movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". Continuing in the article, Paul Eckman, the creator of Facial Action Coding System, classified the six basic emotions. These emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He further associated each characteristic with the movement of certain facial muscles. They generalized emotions with muscles because ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" The software they use can even identify a mix and range of emotions, which is why they gave percents for the Mona Lisa. Further in the article it is said that the computers are simply soing what humans do everyday. We can tell when someone around us is upset, simply by their face. They say that this would be helpful in the future in terms of sadness or happiness based on the ads we see. If an ad pops up and it sees we don't like it, the ad will leave and a new one may appear. The same thing goes in recognizing if a student is bored or confused. It may change the teaching style in order to adapt to the way the child learns. A few paragraphs later, the article basically says if you smile and use the muscles that automatically trigger when you're happy, you will start feeling happy because you are tricking your brain.

Dr. Haung says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too.""

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. To tell how someone is feeling whether or not they are using facial expressions with a computer is kinda of a cool thing. Although, some people just have a straight face and not feeling any type of way. But, in a way it might be weird to others.

Imagine a computer telling you how you feel at that moment and trying to help you feel better. So COOL right! "" The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" That was created by Dr. Huang that now just relies on the psychologists. Also, the text states, "" Dr. Pual Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions-- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness--and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles."" The invention was a very smart invention. If they can brighten someones day, it'll make the world so much happier. Knowing people are always on there phone when they are upset or angry or, evening smiling, that is by far the greatest idea. The text also states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lessons, like an effective human instructor."" Also, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them."" That is amazing progress and who ever would of thought something like this could be done. I believe you could get alot of things done faster, because being bored, confused mad or upset while trying to do work you really dont want to. So something that'll chnge your facial expression to happy is wonderful. Think about all the positivity.

Now. some people like there privacy and dont like sharing or telling peoiple what the problem his. Alot of people are blank faced or like to fake a smile and go on about their day. The text states, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried,etc."" In the meaning of sometimes we dont know how we feel, again sometimes we juist want to be left alone in a situation and figure it out ourselves. The text also states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. "" So computers need to understand that too.""

Facial expressions for each emotion are universal, accoriding to Dr. Huang. Though most of individuals often show varying degrees of expression, using the new technology system would use the video imagery for a new recognition software tracking their facial movements. This would not only be available for the face but also for painting which would make it very intresting to see how the persons face that is on the painting was feeling at the moment or occasion. It could even identify mixed emotions between the expression used to compare a neutral face. For example, te humans perform the same impressive ""caculation"" every day. When you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on the person's face. Much of the people that would try to tell the actual facial trait that would be happy or worried the person would be feeling at the moment.

Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, it shows of how much the computer is able to do with just having the face but still obtaining the right predicament of what the person was feeling which for Mona Lisa was happy. To an extent the system could help even more than just getting to know what people's emotions are. In the passage it had said that if you were to smile or frown on an ad then it would determine what kind of ad would pop up. Thats honeslty great because wouldnt just help the person but also the ads company that had provided it. Another show of creation by the system is that it could make a computer-animated faces more expressive for like video games, or video surgery. This could defentiley have an impact on many workers or company's hoping to improve their software not only themselves but for the people that are into it. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also even could help produce them. Even for the people that are into drama club, could help improve the way they act. This is proven by even an exprienced drama coach, his actors caredully reproduced smiling and frowing as a way of creating these emotions on stage.

I feel like the Facial Action Coding System will or would help students to stay awake and more aware that their computer can read their emoutions and change to how they are feeling like with ads and if you smile when you see one then more would come up like that. When you look at a website and perhaps you smile a lot on this website then the computer could adapt to wedsites that you like.

This means that the computer can calculate which emotion is showing the most by calculating the muscel movement. The emotion that has the most percent is the emotions that your freind or someone is most likey showing.

I don't think that this will help in schools, or the future. Why would we need FACS when you have your own mindset that can tell you how your feeling? Also friends can tell when one is up or down there are many ways to know the humans emotions without using a computer. I think it's just going into someones personal life without asking and thats never ok. There are many things that we need on Earth but, the creating of FACS is not one.

My introduction is respect others the way you want to be respected.",2,7,0.7020637392997742
d5c8caa,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author, Nick D'Alto tells the reader about new computer software that can identify huma n emotions. This new technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. D'Alto portrays this new science as very benificial to the world in many different fields.

One way this new technology can be used, is as a human instructor in the classroom. Dr. Huang states, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Detecting these features would then lead the system to modify the lesson to hep the students who are struggling in the class, or struggling to stay awake in class.

I disagree with D'Alto's claims of this new system being benificial to students. No computer software can replace a real human teacher. No computer software can detect human emotions as well as a human can. There is something about real human connection between teacher and student, that can't be replaced by technology. Also, with multiple students in every class room, the software would have to detect the emotions for every student in the class. Not every student will feel confused during the same time. Some students will be confused during one part of the lesson, and others at different times. This would lead to a flaw in the system, because the software wouldn't know when to change the lesson plan, because it's getting several different readings' from the students.'

In conclusion, no technology can replace a real human teacher. Not only would this new technology take away thousands of jobs across the country if put into classroom's, but students would lose the connection between themselves and their teacher. Sure, some teachers are better than others, but it is still a relationship between two people that a student gets to experience and mature in. Respecting your teacher as a student, will lead to respecting your boss when you get a job in the future. You can respect a person, but you can't respect a computer. This is still true even if the Facian Action Coding System could detect the emotion of ""respect"" one day. ",4,7,0.8390778303146362

it a waste of time because i think we could be able to do more thing then finding out people emoitions instead we could have be able to help out people with cte of any other major pshycologic disies instead its just focussing ono emotion and yes i understand emotions can help us diagnos people with those issues but all i hear i this passage is about emotions nothing else . this is also a huge waste of money,why the technology being used sound like its cost a bunch of money to produce.",2,7,0.783530056476593
d60b8b5,"Making a claim against reading students emotions. In my opinion could be a bad idea. That might be taking technology a little too far. They caculated what the painter painted Mona Lisa feelings would've have been. Thats insane and just a little too far. If they can read a paintings expressions from several years ago. I wouldn't want them reading a humans facial expression. Thats my thoughts on that.

It says they can caculate humans expression like math hoemwork in paragraph 2. It begins with a computer that constructs 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 muscles of the human face must move like human muscles. Each humans facial expression is universal according to the statement in paragraph 4. It's pretty amazing to think about then again it's kind've scary humans can do that reading. I perform the same expressions every day well every one does it isn't just me. It isn't very valuable in my opinion either because maybe if their emotional problems are different then they need to be what are they going to do about it. It will just read his facial expressions won't change anything. That would also cost a lot of money to have in each certain classrooms and also a bunch of money to make the 3-D computer.

In paragraph 6 it says if your frowning and a ad pops up it can read that and if you smile a certain ad would pop up. Just crazy to think about. It says in paragrpah 7 your home Pc couldn't handle reading that of course and they are expensive enough. So that would be much more costly even.",2,7,0.7982519865036011
d62b9c4,"It's safe to say that almost everyone on Earth has tried to hide their emotions on at least one occasion. Humans do this for a reason, and that reason is that they do not want others to know about them. Trying to pry those emotions out can lead to anger, frustration, and confusion. So a person being surrounded by emotion-detecting computers might not be the greatest thing. Now add the factor of millions of emotional teens being faced with them in a place where they are already strained. One of the worst things one can do is assume about something they can't truly understand. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to students in a classroom.

The first obvious elephant in the room is that everyone shows emotions in a different way. While Dr. Huang points out that human facial expressions are universal, he does not deny that ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This stands to be an issue when it comes to reading a persons face. If everyone has different facial expressions, how effective can a computer be at tracking them? It isn't a valuable resource to use if there are so many unreliable factors that play into the performance.

In this day and age computers have taken over in classrooms. Students ranging from elementary to college use them on a daily basis. By adding FACS, Dr. Huang predicts that "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Paragraph 6). This sounds great, but it just isn't reliable. When using a computer in a classroom, students aren't exposed to just the computer. Their environment can effect the way they feel as well. A student could be having multiple conversations that spark emotions like anger, boredom, or confusion. If FACS picks up on those emotions that don't accurately reflect how the student feels about the lesson content, then it isn't providing valuable information. Without it providing useful information, the technology isn't valuable in a classroom.

One aspect of FACS that is useful is that it would create a system that appeal to individual users. A nice example used in the article is ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (Paragraph 6). This is extremely helpful and great for getting rid of those pesky ads. However, it has nothing to do with students in a classroom. Students aren't exposed to ads, and this would provide no benefit for them. The value of this is nonexistent in a place where it can't be used, such as a classroom.

While FACS may be an extremely impressive software, it just doesn't serve as a benefit for students. There are no truly reliable elements that will improve classrooms in a meaningful way. It may be useful to some, but when it comes to students it is not a valuable piece of technology to have.      ",6,7,0.8526387810707092
d640a12,"Hello readers my name is PROPER_NAME and, today I'm gonna dicuss the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman that enables computers to indentify human emotions. Also I'm gonna support this claim about the new human emotions technology,and I'm gonna use details from the story to back up this claim so you readers know ""this new"" technology is legit. So now let's get to it shall we you readers out there.

A Renaissance painting by artist Leonardo da Vinci called Mona Lisa was studied by a scientist named Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who innovated some new computer software that can recognize human emtions, working alongside with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr Huang and his colleague were developing a better way for humans and humans to communicate with each other.I agree with this claim, you wanna why? Because technlogy in general has come a long way, and the fact it's taken to the next step is phenomenal. Like it might be a chance that a computer software can determine how we feel and not just humans in genreal, but even old paintings so long ago isn't that incredible. But in part of the story i feel like tihs software could actually work out was that it said that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one oe more muscles is an ""action unit."" which means that they need to scan the face of a human like features in order to scan the face. When works on thigns like this he normally relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, he is the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Edwin has classified six emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the muscles. For instance when you raise your eyebrows you're surprised, but when you raise your eyebrows down by your mouth you're angry.

Another good reason why i think this technology is really good and it can help is.That when facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Use videp imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements- from a real face such as Mona Lisa. If u weigh the different units' the software can even identify mixed emotions. So cool that just shows you how advanced technology can be. Also each expression is cmpared against a neutral face.

My final defense to back this claim up is that computers got so advanced over the years it's kinda like it knows who to set up your mood of what you wanna see. For instance, if you smile when a Web ad appears on oyur screen, a smilar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different. Hell a classroom computer could even detect when a student is becoming confused or bored. Well in that case it could vhelp modify lesson for the student to make them become more intertested in the assignment.

Well thank you readers i feel like i backed up my case with tih claim, we know computers or even technology in general might've changed in a jurrasic way but we will wonder what the future has in stored for us. We just gotta find out what's next in technology. My name is PROPER_NAME and this is my claim for FACS.      ",2,7,0.783869743347168
d64be3d,"Have you ever wondered how schools can help students who struggle or don't understand the material they cover? Well, the development of the Facial Action Coding System could very easily help with that problem. The Facial Action Coding System could be used in school computers to help recognise when a particular student is struggling, or when the entire class doesn't understand. With its facial detection, it can detect every human emotion, happy or sad, suprised or mad. Not only could the Facial Action Coding System help teachers to know when students aren't following, but it can help computers become more personalized to the student, making it easier to learn. Due to its capability to read faces, the Facial Action Coding System is practical in schools because it can help let teachers know when students are struggling or confused, and it can make a computer more personalized, making the learning process easier.

One reason that the Facial Action Coding System should be used in schools is because of its use in informing teachers when a student really knows what they're doing, or when a student doesn't understand. This could allow teachers to know when they sould review their material. Not all students are verbal about understanding the material, so putting the FACS in school computers could help let teachers know who is good and who is lagging behind. In paragraph 6 of the article, it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This shows that the creator of FACS had uses in school in mind when he invented it. Another reason that FACS should be used in school is its ability to make learning more personal. In the article it says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" A computer knowing your emotions would make it more personal to you. It could know how you feel about some things, and how fast or slow it should go to make learning more personal. With greater use of computers in schools, personalizing computers could only make them easier to use.

In conclusion, due to its capability to read faces, the Facial Action Coding System is practical in schools because it can help let teachers know when students are struggling or confused, and it can make a computer more personalized, making the learning process easier.

Putting the Facial Action Coding System into computers in schools could benefit students and teachers. It could let a teacher know when to slow down or speed up a lesson. The FACS could also make computers more personal to the user by telling them when someone is enjoying a lesson, or bored of a lesson. That is why the Facial Action Coding System should be used in schools.",4,7,0.8110957145690918
d64db4d,"Have you ever wanted to know how someone was feeling, whether it was a student, family member, or even a friend? Well with the help of the Facial Action Coding System, now you can do just that. Facial Action Coding System or ( FACS ) for short is a new computer program that can classify up to six differnet emotions by the movement of all 44 major facial muscles. This invention was created by Prof. Thomas Huang. But here is the real question, would this technology be valuable in a classroom?

For us humans, some may find it easy to tell how someone is feeling based on the look on their face. But for others it isn't so easy. Say a teacher for example, is teaching a science lesson. With this type of technology the teacher would be able to tell if his or her students are understanding the topic being taught, or if they are bored and about to fall asleep. This could change every way that a lesson is being taught in every classroom around the world. This could even raise test scores for kids and teens around the globe.

With this type of technology, you could tell how someone is feeling based on the muscle movements in their face. FACS works based on what's called muscular action units. These action units are all of those 44 major, as well as some minor facial movements. This system is the most accurate system out there for telling how someone is feeling based on their muscle movements. For example, take the zygomatic major. This is the muscle that begins at your cheek bones which helps you create your smile. Or the frontalis pars lateralis muscle. This is the muscle above your eyes which helps raise your eyebrows when you are surprised.

Based on all the research, there is the six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All these emotions happen in a classroom more then anyone would ever imagine. If students were having trouble understanding a math lesson, then this technology could pick that up if the student didn't say they were confused. This technology could be very useful for teachers because it could give them feedback about what they need to do better, or go over more throughly. It could even give them the chance to even change the whole lesson all together and slow it down for students to understand.

So how valuable would this technology be in a classroom environment? Well in my opinion it seems very important. I say this because the technology could tell whether a student was comprehending a lesson, and if they weren't. This technology could also give feedback to the teacher to show if they need to show the lesson over so the students could understand the topic better. This technology could possibly even raise test scores based on the feedback it gives teachers, all based on the looks on the students faces. This new technology known as Facial Action Coding System could help teachers comprehend their students and if they are learnig, confused, or even excited.",4,7,0.8784996271133423

In Paragraph 6, it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could easily make test scores go up in many of our schools.

In Paragraph 1, when describing Mona Lisa, it says ""She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". If it can truly see emotions that specifically, we would be able to find out if a kid is feeling depressed, which would definitely drop the suicide rate thats spiked over the years. We could also identify if a kid is feeling angry, and find a way to calm him/her before there are any fights, or even worse, shootings.

Also, if we can see how a student feels about a particular lesson, we could adjust it accordingly.

d6b3e06,"I am usually a bit skeptical about new technologies like the Facial Action Coding System, but I am opened to the idea of new technology. In this case I support the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. It is pretty interesting how the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can determine the emotion someone is feeling by examining the muscle movements in the face. The FACS could be a very usefull tool in many ways in the near future.

The FACS uses facial movents to determine whether a person is feeling happy, sad, surpised, angry, disgusted, fearful, or sad. The interesting thing about the FACS is that it can determine whether the person is faking an emotion. For example, the article stated,"" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius"". So by examining muscle movements in the face, the FACS can determine whether the person is faking an emotion or actually feeling it. In the future I think therapist could use the FACS to help determine how his/her patent is actually feeling. Dr. Huang stated,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". I think that this would be an effective way to futher advance eduction in our society.

In conclusion, I agree with the use of the Facial Action Coding System. I believe it will help us advance as a society and make things less dificult. I feel as if the technology could be used in many ways besides schools. Many professions, such as pyscologist could use this technology.      ",3,7,0.8296834230422974
d6c80ef,"In Making Mona Lisa Smile, there are really great points toward technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. In the first paragraph it talks about the start of the computer program. In the last sentence of paragraph 1, it states ""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comminicate."" In this case the communication is showing the computer how you feel and the computer doing something to change.

This new technology of being able to tell how you are feeling on the computer is called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). There are 6 classified emtions- happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear and sadness- and you can tell all of this with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. There are different facial expressions that you can tell if a smile is fake or not. In your real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at cheek bone) lift the corners of your mouth. The other muscles is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus and that makes the corw's- feet around your eyes. If it is a fake smile, the mouth is streched out sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius. You can easily tell how anyone is feeling just by looking at their facial expressions.

I believe that you could use FACS to help with a lot of things. For examples, when a kid is broed at shcool or they are falling asleep in class, the computer will sence that and change up what is going on to the computer to make them stay focused or interseted longer. You can simply tell how one of your friends are feeling just by the look on their face or their facial expressions and sometimes you don't really know whats wrong you can just feel it. Now that they have came up with FACS you don't really have to worry about the expressions because sooner or later it will come out of them about what is wrong. ",2,7,0.8109242916107178
d6ca3a3,"In our technological advancements today, the idea of withholding a laptop that has the ability to read your emotions is mindblowing. Using this type of technology could potentionally put smiles of faces to people all around the world. The use of the Facial Action Coding system would greatly benefit the students' views for technology, the students' view for themselves, and most importantly the way that students' view their peers.

The Facial Action Coding Sytem has the power to change technology as we know it. It would forever change the way we use and percieve technology in our day to day routine. According to Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad....'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored'"" (D'Alto). This would bring a whole new light into classrooms. You would find students more engaged and intrested in their studies. Just as D'Alto metions, teachers will be able to critique themselves and better their teaching skills.

If we had the acces to this type of technology on our home desktop or laptop, it would help the user and the laptop or desktop to learn more about what the prefer and what they dont prefere. According to Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto,""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smililar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different""(D'Alto). These simple tasks can make technology smarter and bring smiles onto any individuals face.

Lastly, the most important reason why withholding this type of technology would be the benefits of teachers and students knowing the emotions of their students/peers. According to Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto,""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression'...'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...'"" (D'Alto). Since facial expressions are universal, being aware of others emotions will bring people together and could bring about new or stronger relationships between students and or other students or student to teacher.

Imagine a computer can tell how you're feeling just from your face, like for example you go to a computer and ask her how am I feeling today, then the computer will say= 83%happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, 2%angry; And you'll be like WHAT?, how can a simple computer make such a thing?.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, with 44 major muscles this is called ""action unit"".

Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)

BODY: Dr. Huang observes that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal and humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day; How?: you can probably tell how is your friend feeling just looking at him or hearing his voice.

This software could change the whole world; For example imagine you are in the ethernet and then a web ad player pop's up, if you smile at it a similar ad might follow; But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts.

CONCLUSION: Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also can help produce them; we unconsciously imitate person's facial expressions. So in conclusion I would say that we can start using this magnificient software and his technology to read student's emotional expressions because it could also help teacher's to see how their student's are doing and if someone is distracted or bored the computer will notice the teacher so he/she can move on into another thing or go talk with the student.

This new software is called Facial Action Coding System and was created by Prof. Thomas Huang, from the University of Illinois, with colaboration of Prof. Hicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. These two profesors are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate.

The purpose of the Facial Action Coding System is to recognize the subtle facial movements that humans use to express their emotions. The process of creating this new technology began with a 3-D computer model of the human face; all 44 facial muscles were included. With the of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman. Eckman classified six basic emotions such as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

Have you wondered if this technology would be useful for a classroom?

It would certantly be useful in some cases, for example, an investigation. Imagine there has been a case of bullying that ended up with suicide. Everyone who is connected to the victim, which is a student, had to be tested with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to whether tell if the student was telling the truth. In these kind of cases would be useful.

However, if this techology, the FACS, was used for only classroom purposes the would only be for Pscychology. This is a High School level class, it wouldn't be used for Elemtary or Middle School. Unless the staff of the schools introduces this technology to the kids. Unless there is a study for kids emotions at school when presented in various different situations.

In conclusion, there are many uses for this software but not exactly for classroom uses. The government, the police, investigators, and phisicans may use these to determine many things. Crimes would be sloved by studying the expressions of a suspect in a trial or interogation.",3,7,0.863196074962616
d72abd4,"There are many ways for a human being to convey an emotion with a facial expression. Someone can indicate happiness by smiling, sadness by frowning, or, confusion by furrowing their eyebrows. Each facial expression signifies someone's emotions or thoughts to others. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology that allows computers to recognize and identify human emotions. Although the FACS is a creative and unique way of identifying human emotions, using the FACS to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

The main reason why using the FACS to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable is because of the importance of expressing human emotions to others. In a world full of new technology that is constantly being improved, it is appealing for people to try out new gadgets and devices. However, as people are connecting with technology instead of connecting with other human beings face to face, the social aspect of humans is failing. In Nik D'Alto's article about the FACS, he excitedly asks readers the question, ""Hold on! Can we actually 'calculate' emotions - like math homework?"" The FACS's goal is to ""'calculate' emotions - like math homework."" The FACS denies students the chance to feel empathy for others. If students are constantly concerning themselves with what the computer ""calculate[d]"" their emotions to be, then students feel like they can only express themselves through technology. As a result, no human connection is made when students are having a conversation face to face. Emotions are meant to be shared and expressed freely so that friendly relationships can be made; they are not meant to be solved like ""math homewrk"" in a classroom. The FACS takes away the human and social connection between students, which is extremely important for students to build healthy relationships and make smart decisions.

Although the FACS is a creative and unique way of reading human emotions, it is not valuable for students to use it in a classroom. The new software would cause a lack of empahty for others, confusion about how students should express their emotions, and poor social interactions between students. Many new inventions of quicker and higher-quality technology is exciting to test out at first. However, placing the FACS in classrooms causes students to conform to ideas that cause their emotions to not be expressed healthily to others. Students would begin to find it normal to share their emotions with a computer screen rather than the student sitting right next to them.",4,7,0.8766430616378784
d73b983,"A new technology, known as the Facial Action Coding System, was developed by Doctor Paul Eckman. This system attempts to decipher human emotions, which is simply unneeded. The technology detects movement of the 44 muscles in a human face and uses this to label the emotion the person is feeling. In a classroom, this technology is not valuable because humans already calculate emotions more accurately and quickly than the Facial Action Coding System, because common comptuers cannot use the software, and because the system would needlessly waste class time.

First, this technology is completely pointless because humans already calculate emotions quicker and more accurately than the Facial Action Coding System. The only thing the system does it add an extra step to calculating emotions. In the article, it says ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.""

With the new technology, the computer creates a model of the face, detects movement of muscles on the face, then compares the expression on the face to a neutral face, then after all of that, it finally tells you how the person is feeling.

Why would a person look at a computer to learn what another person is feeling when he or she could do it? This can be applied to the classroom because teachers can tell how their students are responding to a particular lesson. For example, teachers call on students who are not paying attention just to get their attention. Teachers do not need this new technology because they are already great at sensing when a student is confused or bored.

In addition, this technology would be hard to put in classrooms around the United States because it cannot work on a common computer. In the article, it states ""your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that in order to put the Facial Action Coding System into schools nationwide, new computers would be needed which would cost a great amount of money that simply is not worth is. As it is, schools already run tight budgets so the money that is needed for the new technology would take away from other neccessities that schools need. The teachers of schools that have the system would have to be trained on how to use it, not to mention the Technology Department employees. Frankly, the ends do not justify the means in this situation.

Finally, the technology would waste a great amount of class time, for no good reason at all. Multiple times throughout my day at school, teachers cannot figure out how to turn on the Smartboard or projector to teach a lesson. How would the Facial Action Coding System be any different? Teachers struggle to use simple technology like Smartboards or projectors, so using the Facial Action Coding System would just be asking for more problems. The amount of class time that would be wasted trying to set up the system would be ridiculous. As is, my teacher teach until the bell rings, and any wasted time would be time wasted that could be used for teaching.

Although the Facial Action Coding System is a cool new technology, it would not be valuable to classrooms. This technology is pointless because humans already can calculate emotions base on facial expressions. In addition, the system would be hard to implement into classrooms nationwide because the system cannot work on a common computer. Finally, class time would be needlessly wasted. Simply put, the classroom is better off without the Facial Action Coding System. ",5,7,0.8927080035209656

d786da7,"Do we need a Facial Action Coding System in our classrooms? I agree, with using a Facial Acton Coding System in our classroom. The Facial Action Coding System could help teacher know what their students' emotions are, and if the students emotions are in negative mood or positive mood they can change their lessons so they are more interesting for the students. Not only could this help the teachers but, this may help the students be more engaged in the classroom and participate more duriung lessons when they need to. Classroom computers acn already dectect how a student is feeling by giving teh student a certain AD depending on their mood.""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts(Paragraph 6). If you make a facial expression it not only shows how you are feeling, it can also help you produce your facial muscles. In conculsion, it woulcd be a great idea for teachers to use them in the classroom, and they probably put them in work areas so managers know how their emploees are feeling in their work area.",2,7,0.8821248412132263

d80032d,"The Facial Action Coding System is it useful? Yes, it would be useful because people might be able to be into things that they would probably get board with. Students may finally be willing to learn stuff on thier own instead of being forced to learn something they are not intrested in. this can all come true if we make the facial action coding sytem available to stores around the world.

The Facial Action Coding System is a program that can read a person's emotions. When a person is frustrated the program can alter the screen to help the person better understand something or to help them become less frustrated. This program can also inform a teacher that a student does not understand what they are doing. This also can help the teacher do his or her job better. the advnced science at the university of illinois working in colaboration with prof are developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate.

This program is able to help read emotions and determines what a person is feeling. It does this by reading complex algorithms that were also used to decode mona lisa's smile. This program picks up the smallest details like when you raise the corners of your lips. Also it can pick up when you squint your eyes you produce a wrinkle called crowsfeet at the croners of you eyes.

This program should be available to stores world wide because it could create a solution to much confusion and frustration. This program could make people want to learn stuff. Also this program can be cool and fun for people to try. Another thing would be that Ferinsics caan use this to tell what people are feeling and determine if the are nervous about somthing or not.

d8361b9,"Body actions say more than words could ever say. This can simply be tested by taking a glance at any individual you may come in-contact with; almost immediately, our brains can process exactly how the other person is feeling. In recent years, this process we do ourselves, has turned to technology. Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckam Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has worked close by Professor Nicu Seb from the University of Amsterdam, to accomplish creating a computer program that can capture and explain human emotions. After some time, this work in progress became a reality, and was named the Facial Action Coding System. This invention has sparked interest in many different groups of people and in many varying fields of work. One of these fields is education. The Facial Action Coding System can positvely be used in the classroom to improve overall student experience by effectively and accurately catching a glimpse of their nonverbal communication in hopes to result in lesson plan alterations and opening prime opportunities for vulnerability in teacher to student relationships.

This new technology advancement has been found to provide very accurate results based on anatomy; therefore, would be sucessful no matter where it was used. Creator, Dr. Huang, definitely did his research when creating the Facial Action Coding System. The text reads, ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to convery specific emotions."" Based on this information, it is easy to see that our body language, and simple expressions are simply coded in our human anatomy; Da Vinci knew it and now so do many others. All of the human muscles work together to deliver our innermost feelings and thoughts. The text reads, Eckman has classified six basic emotions -- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness -- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" This information is essentially the way in which the Facial Action Coding System calculates human emotions in hopes to cause other people to potentially act differently. All humans use the same facial muscles, so this product can be effective on anyone.

Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This piece of text is important to comprehend in order to fully understand the capabilities of the Facial Action Coding System. By using this structured and prepared system the results relayed back to an individual are extremely accurate. As a result of this accuracy, not only could the product be used anywhere; one of the most effective uses would lie in the classroom. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System uses a sytematic process to determine any individual across the world's emotions; which is an important piece of evidence because many individuals may not believe its' accuracy.

The Facial Action Coding System can effectively used in the classroom to adjust lesson plans based on student preference. One aspect, Dr. Huang mentions is the prevelance of nonverbal communication; especially for young children who are in the education system. He says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, includimg emotional communication."" This quote is significant when in the context of the Facial Action Coding System. Within the walls of a classroom this computer program could be used to dig deeper into a students emotions and feelings in order to understand them better and adjust to specific needs. For example, after using this program on a group of kids in the classroom; red flags may appear that gear toward frustration, stress, or confusion and this would give way for a teacher to step in and make a difference. If a large group of students were confused, the teacher would then know they may need to review the topic more thouroughly or by taking an alternate approach. If the computer system can reveal that a student is frustrated, the teacher would be able to console them positively in hopes they would be willing to take part in extra help or practice wihtin a subject. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student in becoming confused or bored."" As previously mentioned, by using the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher will be informed of the emotions and feelings of their students that they are unwilling to first hand share with an adult. Overall, this computer program would offer many positive advancements to the classroom that help teachers better prepare for individual student needs and preferences.

As the Facial Action Coding System could contribute to a teacher's knowledge of student reaction in the classroom, it could also make the classroom a much happier place by opening up chances for vulnerability and positive emotions. As previously stated, as a teacher becomes more aware of his or her students' emotions and takes practical steps towards fulfilling their individual needs; a door to vulnerability is quickly opened. Within the walls of a classroom, the relationship between a teacher and student is very important and can make or break a students learning for a short span of time. If the Facial Action Coding System was able to spot a negative emotion, and enable the teacher to step in and help the student walk through that struggle; vulnerability happens in the classroom and can make it a much better place to be. In additon the text reads, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" As the FACS enters into classroom usage, many students will become more aware of emotions they may be unable to verbalize. With this knowledge they may be able to better combat their negative body language and work on recognizing when their emotions may be going down a wrong path and be able to change it quickly. Just as that quote said, making a specific emotion may allow the individual to rapidly improve. Overall, the usage of FACS in the classroom would allow for students to have much more realistic and intentional relationships with their teachers and improve their emotions everyday.

All in all, the Facial Action Codign System is a computer system created that could have many important usages in the future. However, one of the most essential would be within the walls of a classroom. This opportunity would open many positive chances for emotions to be relayed accurately to a teacher in hopes that they would be able to alter lesson plans and change other aspects of their teaching style to better suit individual student needs. In addition, other studies and research completed with the FACS shows that this system can and will relay accurate results because body language is universal and our human anatomy does not lie. Lastly, allowing students to better understand their emotions will help them react to them before they may get out of hand. With early detection and acknowledgement of negative emotions the classroom could become a much happier place to be. This system is going to change the way many programs work, but mostly within the classroom. Teens emotions are always changing, body actions always say more than words could ever.

There are so many emotions; bored, happy, sad, angry, confused, scared, and your telling me that this ""Facial Action Coding System"" can detect them all? Putting ""technology to read the emotional expressions of a student"" is a big NO. Even at times we don't know how we feel, how can a computer tell us what we feel.

These computers being able to identify human emotions is scary if you think about it. Over the pass ten years the interenet has become a real popular thing. People use it to socialize and play game, but what happens when someone loses in a game or doesnt agree with what someone else is saying. We have a reaction thats not exspected. People can be very agressive verbaly through the interent. Because of the interent there have been more suisides now then there has ever been. Knowing how you feel could increase the risk of suside and/or thoughts of suiside considering over half of the worlds population has depression. (which can lead to suiside)

Even if this ""Facial Action Coding System"" can detect our feelings what actions are going to be taken. Even though ""Alto"" did say ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

They didn't give any imformation on how they are going to do that. It sounds like when they say ""like an effective human instuctor"" they are refering to a robot which has no expresion in its voice. That would make someone not pay attention even more the voice would be very boring causing the student to doze off even more.

Sometimes Schools are more poor then other and have no way of paying for computers. This softwear ""Facial Action Coding System"" could cost money they never adressed cost in the article. This would also be something that the teacher and students would have to adapt to as well. Where just now getting laptops and Ipads into schools to ""better push education."" I read a study over E-Learning vs Paper. They took a group of students of the same grade level, and split them into two groups. Gave them both the same exact passage with the same exact questions, but one was all on the computer while the other one is on paper. When the results came back from both groups more kids on paper did better. Not only do kids learn better using paper we save money from having to buy computers that may have been broken or damaged.

People need to experince all of these different kinds of emotions to be able to handle these experinces. Without these experinces when something where to happen we wouldnt be able to handle it. If we continue with using ""Facial Action Coding System""

Suiside rates could go up. Using this in classroom could also make students get less infomration by not being able to focus on what's being tought to them.

Not everyone lives in the riches places would this program be able to be funded to schools or pay through the goverment.

This is somthing that we should not go on forward with because doing so may make us suffer the effects of the future causing the people of our future to be looked down upon.      ",5,7,0.831740140914917

To which would let the teachers be able to switch up how they teach that student . This device also uses a very reliable computer program to calculate the face muscles. This would make it the most relatable to human facial muscles.

Finally, this device has many benefits to it such as, reading emotional expressions and even telling if there faking that expression.

This use of this technology would benefit teachers by letting them know how the students feel. ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions""(D'Alto).For example lets say a student is feeling fustrated on a test, so he might show he's happy so the teacher wont come question him. The teacher can use the FACS device and understand exactly how the student is feeling. Instead of him thinking that the student is happy he could look on the device and it would tell him exactly what he feels and what percent of all the emotions take up. Overall, this Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in the classroom.

Another way this technology is benefical would be the calculations of the muscles of your face. What this means is the device would "" constructs a 3-D computer model of the face""(D'Alto).

d8d429b,"The value of using facial action coding is not completely accurate. We can not rely on an computer to analyze our emotions and expression. A computer is able to recognize all fourty four major musces in the face, but what if its off by one. Computers are able to mess up just like how a human can. There are only six basic emtions that technology is able to detect such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. But we know that there are variety of emotions and feelings for humans. What if the emotion the computer gives us is not how we feel?

The technology can also help people see what kind of emotion other people are feeling.

The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can help a teacher understand how their students are feeling. For example, if some students are bored, the teacher can try to do something more exciting. In paragraph 6 it states, ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This shows that a teacher would know if a student is confused and could explain to a student more to help them. This new technology helps both students and teachers.

The text says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.""(paragraph 9) This means that moving your facial muscles can help you be in a better mood. It may help students smile more, which can make them feel better.

The Facial Coding System can help friends and family recognize each other feelings. Instead of wondering if someone is not in a good mood, the technology will tell you.

Technology, such as phones, laptops, or any devices, is not always true. They can predict about how people feel or their emtions. For example, in the second paragraph in the first sentence, it says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"".

Every people have different types of emotions. It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? Computers are like robots. Computers can't prefer if someone is smiling or upset. Computers don't understand if someone is really smiling for real or faking smiling. It depends on someone's face. For instance, when a friend talk something fun, I smile but when a friend talk something boring, I smile too so they can be happy.

Is putting on a happy face actually work? I prefer not because it depends on someone's emotions inside instead of the outside. Not everybody can read someone's mind. In the last paragraph in the second sentence, it says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"".

In my opinion i think that they should use The Facial action coding system because you never know what someone is hidding or what they thing about the lesson in class or the work in a job. Also most of us will probably know how someone is feeling but some of us will not and that is were the Facial Action Coding system kickes in.

The most important thing about his machine is that there has been people that committed suicede and if the machine can detect what you feel i think that it can detect those people or kids and that way thier parents or teachers could know and stop it from happening and that machine can save a life or two. The machine can be also be used for police officers that need to slove a case or thing that someone is lying so they will just have to put the machine in thier face and ask questions and that will beb a win for th epolice officers. The article also said that the drawing of Mona Lisa was not only smilling she was also, ''9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 83 percent happy and 2 percent angry''. So if that machine told them all those percents in just a smile that the painting did that is amazing.

The best way to put this is that anything is posiblie you just have to do it, Because in the article it says ''Moving you facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help prduce them put on a happy face.

The Mona Lisa one of the most known peice of art from the Renaissance area made by Leonardo Da Vinci's is said to be the only painting at that time that seems to be a woman smiing but that is false. The Mona Lisa was actually showing more then just a smile she was showing three more different emotion besides happyness. The reason that is because when they took a picture of her and put her face in 3D humans face it showed that she was disgusted,fearful,and angry.

This technology is called the Facial Coding System. I believe the Facial Coding System would be valuable to students in a classroom or anywhere else for that matter.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."", The reader is being told that with this new software scientist can now ""caculate"" emotions. Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of the Facial Aaction Coding System and he has classified happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, and sadness as the six basic emotions. Manypeople would ask how can a computer see or feel those six basic exspressions? Well, according to the text Dr. Huang stated,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". They used video imagery recognize a real face and even the painting of mona lisa. There are more steps that go into the Facial Action Coding System.

After the different units are weighed out the software will identify mixed emotions. According to paragraph four,"" Each expression is compared against aa neutral face (showing no emotion)"". In order for the third step to work it has to be compared to a non-facial exspression. We as humans do the same type of steps when making an assumption. Think about the way we can tell if our friend or family member is feeling. Nomatter if they are sad, mad, happy, or glad we usually can see or feel how they feel.

We can tell how they feel based off of the facial expression they chose to give. According to the text Dr. Huangs new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. This means that the computer code uses algorthms to figure out the facial expression just like artists do when they paint facial muscles to give off a specific emotion in a painting. Computers have rules or instructions to follow in order to complete something. Its called encoding. Encoding is not jst used for computers but, it s also used by us as humans. We tell ourselves how to feel, walk, talk, act, and many other things. Our brain sends out instructions to our entire body just like the motherboard does for a computer.

In conclusion the

Facial Coding System would be valuable to students in a classroom or anywhere else for that matter. We already have a system we use everyday as people to see how other people feel. Knowing how somebody feels can help us help them. If we could have the knowledge of definetly knowing how a person felt scientifically it would realy help us help them in understanding the trials and tribulations they might be going through.",3,7,0.9040811061859131

Many people might just not want to let know what is behind that ""Fake Smile"" people just dont really want theire own expression to hurt other peoples feelings. This is the way i can think one one example, say you take a picture with a celebrity thats maybe tired or realy mad but still has to take a photot with you and make a fake smile. You wouldnt even know until you get home and check on the image to see whats behind that act and whats behind the image,thats wheb you get upset and find out about the trusth because maybe its the not the moment that you wanted to capture in for that photot with a person you admire. Another example, we now know or think we know what Lisa was feeling behind that image but nobody will eventually end up knowing the actual truth behind that. Anatomy is a great thing to know about because you are learning nealry evey single thing about the body such as the mucles and the organs and all the small things nody would have even known of before. Eventually technology could get so better as these generations change, people now know better ways of acting and making themselfs feel a way they might not want to feel but yet can lie to others. Not all cameras on a computer might be able to detect much from a face. What would be the point of doing all this research and finding ways to know whats behind an image. What are people now doing about the photo now that they ""Know"" what Mona Lisa was feeling. Will ther be changes and speeches about what behind photos now?

The new software that has been developed and is being used on humans is the Facial Action Coding System. The first subject was the Mona Lisa painting, to us it is just a portrait with a woman in it smiling, but to Dr. Huang he uses a coding system to find out that she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2% angry (D'Alto 1). This was all figured out by a computer, now imagine being able to read a whole class room full of students real emotions with just one click of a button.

If teachers and other students knew how a whole class room of students were actually feeling deep down inside everyone could probably end up having a good day everyday. Most people like to keep their emotions privite, because living in this world today anyone can put a smile on their face and pretend they are okay. Not everyone is really ever always okay. Which us humans are aware of because we can tell how someone is feeling just by the looks on their face. Yet humans are not experts so to us, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" (D'Alto 4). No one ever truly knows how one another is feeling, but this Facial coding system can help fix that. Evidence states in paragraph 8, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celbrity isn't being truthful."" With this new technology humans can physically no longer lie about how they are feeling. While joining this experiment it is said by, ""the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them."" So if a class room of students just joined this experiment it could actually make them much more happier.

Concluding, that this tecnological emotional experiment being used on a classroom full of students could help everyone have a good day every day. Everwhere around the world humans can put a smile on their face and predend they are okay, but with this new coding system it could truly help prevent that. If a student in the class room was pretending to be okay, and then stood infront of the computure to be coded it would pick up the real emotions on the face just by obseving a mouth being streached sideways using the zygomatic major and risorius revealing the student isn't actually happy. With the help of Science and Dr. Huang it could reveal so much more about the real emotions in someone elses life that no one ever knew about. ",3,7,0.8771595358848572
da550db,"Reading emotions is done on a day to day bases in the minds of people. That is how we can tell is our friends are upset or happy about something. The author of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto, talks about new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students would be valuable so the teacher can see how well they have to students attention and what they can do to change things if they need to. If teachers had the ability to use the FACS, they would be able to see how many students enjoy the class and that they are focused on the class. Also they would be able to see how many kids aren't happy to be in class and no paying attention. The FACS can read the emotions happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. A teacher wants to have all the attention of their students but, it doesn't always happen, teachers knowing when students start to fade out of the topic can help them change how they are teacher to help the student want to learn and stay on task. All around students need to learn and teachers need to teach, it would be very useful to have teachers be able to access the FACS to be able to teach to the best of their abilities so that the students car and will learn. Reading others emotions easily would make everyone's lives easier beacause they know how they really feel about something. So, people can change what they are doing to help other people want to do things. ",2,7,0.8772736191749573

This conclusion was drawn from a new computer software that can recognize emotions.

While that's a pretty awesome example of what this technology can do, there's the lingering question of if this technology should be used in classrooms.

While it could read emotions to decide if lessons need to be easier, there are more cons to this technology than pros.

Therefore, this technology is not valuable enough to be used in classroom with students because humans have more complex emotions that can't be explained with six emotions, teachers are already in classrooms to assess these emotions, and this technology is just not practical enough yet.

First of all, the new emotion-reading technology cannot read enough emotions to be valuably used in classrooms.

The article stated that the software can only recognize happiness, surprise, disgust, fear, and sadness.

How can a software only recognizing six emotions effectively judge if a student is struggling in class.

Humans have more complex emotions than what can be defined through different percetages of just six emotions.

Also, struggles bring upon different emotions in humans depending on how someone takes that struggle.

Some people may feel confused, while others will be indifferent and just move on.

While this software can't even recognize these complex emotions, how will it effectively assess someone's feelings of confusion in class?

Secondly, classrooms are composed of a teacher and students.

The teacher is there to carefully assess the learning of the students and adjust the pace of the course.

Teachers can read emotions of students better than computers because they are human just like the students are humans.

Humans can relate, recognize, and comprehend other people's feelings better than a computer software. Also, having difficulties understanding new ideas is part of the learning process.

When one does not understand, they go to their teacher for help.

This helps students learn how to form relationships with other people including their teachers.

If a computer analyzes how a student feels and adjusts the lesson, the students will never learn the valuable lesson of how to face struggles and overcome them with help from other people like teachers.

Lastly, this technology is not developed enough yet to be valuable to use in a classroom.

The article stated that a home PC can not handle the complex algorithims of the software. If a home PC can't handle it, the laptops at schools probably can not either.

It would be quite costly to implicate this software into the educational system making it lose its value.

The high cost is not overweighed by the outcome, so it is not practical enough.

In conclusion, the emotion-recognizing software is not valuable enough to be used in classrooms.

The software can not recognize complex emotions, teachers are already there to find these emotions and adjust the lessons, and it is not cost-effective to implement this technology in classrooms.

While emotion-recognizing software is a great leap forward in technology, it is just not valuable enough to use in classrooms yet.",4,7,0.81746506690979
da6836e,"The Facial Action Coding System or known as ""FACS"" is a software that 3-D prints the picture exactly how it is with all the 44 major muscles that are identical to the person in the picture. From there it goes to psychologists and they classify the type of emotion that they see in the 3-D model. The psychologists refer to the six classified basic emotions which are Hapiness, Surprise, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness.

Having this in a classroom would be a cool idea but in my opinion i think there is no need for something like this in a classroom. The students may find it interesting but it wont teach them anything unless they are studying to be a psychologist or something related to that. The students may or may not like this but if they do come out with something like they were talking about when they said an ad popped up and the computer sees yout frown and puts a similar ad on the screen the computer will recongize that you are getting bored or not liking that so the computer would change the type of ad. If they come out with this then i can see it being used in the schools where students can learn what makes them mad or happy.

When it comes to ""FACS"" in the classroom it might not be the best option for students to learn about that unless they want to have a career similar or like a psychologist they should keep the ""FACS"" to the people who made it to make technological improvements and release it to people who would need this to help patients and then release it to students who are in college or a type of school that have students who want to be a psychologist or to people like video game designers who need this to make better improvements to characters int the games they are creating.",2,7,0.8283637762069702
da89a81,"Is it valuable to know a student emotion during class time? Yes, it is valubel to know how a student is feeling. Most teachers would actually like to know what every student in the class room is going threw there head and how they are feeling. Thanks for the technology called the Facial Action Coding System would make this job easy for a teacher to know what their student is feeling during class. Eventhough there might be some down sides. Like for example what if a student is going through a rough time in life and they do not want anyone to know or even just privacy that vcan be an issue but having that new technology would help a lot more than not helping.

One of the reasons that this technology could help out, is to know your student. This will help out a teacher a lot because not only they can know what a student is feeling, they can alos help them. In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it stated ""Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS..... Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sandness"" all these emotion can help out a teacher know what a student is feeling. It can also help a teacher porform a better calss because they know how the students feels and like by the exprisions of their face.

Many students go through a lot of things out of school. A teacher my not know whats wrong with the student or what is happing in their lives. This technology can show you if the student is sad, anger or fear. Evey school wants each student to be happy and to feel safe. The school can know if the student feels fear for example. Then the teacher can help out the student and make it feel safe and not feel fear. That also goes the same for every other emotion that is not good or happy. Schools can help out more in the student life if they know what they are feeling.

The last reason is that it can not only make it easy on a teacher but also a student too. This technology can know when a student is confused, bored or not happy. In the article it states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" by this new way of teching it would make a big difernece because then students would want to learn

by cathing their attention on what they like and makes them happy. Now schools won't be boring and be enjoyable to the students. Teachers wont have to fight and argue with students that do not like schools on paying atttention to the school work. It will benifit both teacher and student.

In conclusion this next technology ""FACS"" can impact a school, tecahers and students in many good ways. Like knowing what a student is feeling or has issues. It can make it so much easyer for a tecaher as well to a student during school time and work. Yes it is valuable to read the emotion expressions of students in a calss room.

But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives.

Thomas Huang said that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major bones in the model move like human mussles.

What did they do to make the Mona Lisa look different? What the have done here

is weighting the different units, this software can make mixed emotions. The new computer software stores simliar anatomical infomation as electronic code. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intened to bring a smile to your face. Just imagine a computer can tell if your happy or sad, for example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow.

At home are Pc can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode the Mona Lisa's smile. Do you think that in the mirror suggest an emotion? It's all about those muscular action units. The can see the difference between a genunie smile and a forced one. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, a different mussle, the risorius. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

In the end all we talked about here is that technogly has gone along way to make people happy, sad, and mad. They are making new ways that can show weather you are fake smiling or have a real smile. They also made it to were thet can change the Mona Lisa to not look so mad. So after all the technogly has involed a lot to making people happy, sad, or mad.   ",1,7,0.728639543056488

But not such that. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everday. For instance you can probably tell if a friend is feeling simply emotion by looking at thair face. But for some people painting portraits can help them express their feelings through painting. Sometimes people express their emotions through music by singing or making music. Then in the Mona Lisa, no one knows what feeling she is expressing and what is she feeling. For instance, some artists say she is happy but no one really knows what emotion she is feeling. In conclusion, I think classrooms shouldn't use Facial Action Coding System to identify the expression of students an how they are feeling. But some people have hidden talents that they use to express themselves or their emotions. Also not many people icluding students express themselves through painting some use dancing, acting, making music, singing, cooking and their are many ways of expressing your emotions through many things.

There is nothing the Facial Action Coding could do for people in the world if you ask me.

Putting up Ads that is based off your emotion is not a smart idea to me. So if im angry im most likely will have a negative vibe and if you put something up that is close to be negative its not going to make me happy. If I am in a good mood more than likely I would not want to see no Ad. Then there expression is compared against a neutral face, some people just look naturally mad.

Technology now is so innovative that now we may be able to use this in classrooms to tell whether or not to change a subject or not when a teacher is teaching.

So all of this begins when a computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 of the major muscles in your face. In the model all these muscles move like a actual humans. Dr. Paul Echman ,creator of the FACS, classified the face having 6 basic emotions- happiness ,surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness. Each thing is accosciated with its own characteristic movement. Each and every single person has the same universal emotions on there face, they are all universal. Dr. Huang said that "" even tho individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" The real question is tho is how this can help us when it comes to school and teachings in the classroom. What I mean by this is that teachers could know when the students are not finding interest in a subject of a disscussion anymore. This technology can scan the room and see what peoples emotions are during the subject and if they are not good then the teacher could try a different approach and if that worked then they would know that is what they need to try for the next class. Everyone learns a certain way and if you have a class that has a majority of people that learn a certain way then you know the sense of direction you need to teach based on this technology.

Sometimes people can´t always tell is someone is smiling or not, maybe that could happen to the computer.

It might be usless in the classroom on students because Dr. huang said you cant wlays tell the full trait of happy. The computer might not be able to tell the whole trait of any emotion.

Imagine you are sitting in history class, and all of a sudden you start to fall asleep. You start to nod off because you are learning boring old history, when all of a sudden the lesson changes its tone to be more interesting. In return you do not fall asleep, and you learn plenty of new information. This technology is called Facial Action Coding System, and it should be used in the classroom. If this technology is used it will lead to less boredom, more engagment, and a general improvment in the school's atmosphere.

Firstly, this technology can be used to make school less boring. With this technology installed it would be able to detect when you are bored, and be able to change the lesson in order to make it less boring. This can lead to more learning being accomplished, because teachers would not have to spend time reteaching a subject. History is not boring, and if a computer could make history appealing to students then it should be practiced. People who oppose this technology may say that it is not advanced enough to detect human emotions. In rebuttle, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" (D'Alto)

Secondly, this technology can be used to increase the student's engagement in the school. If a student is excited to learn new information, then they are engaged. If students are activily engaged with their learning they will do better in school. With students preforming better in school it could lead to an improvement in life, and to the advancement of the human race. American schools are also lagging behind thier counterparts, and this increase in engagment would benifit the American Educational System.

Thirdly, this technology can be used to improve the general environment of the school. Everybody goes through rough patches in their life, and sometimes students want to talk to administrators. Even if a student talks to an adult, they do not always tell the truth. With Facial Action Coding System they will be able to tell if you a telling the truth. For example ""Meanwhile, muscles called oribicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius.""

db534ee,"Prof. Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe collaborated to innovate a computer software called the ""Facial Action Decoding Sytem"", which recognizes facial emotions. The software can construct a 3-D model of the face and is programmed to recognize specific traits. Basic emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, fear, and sadness can all be detected, as well as a mix of them all. This innovation has the potential to be revolutionary if placed in a classroom.

Many emotions are portrayed by students every day, and they can be a key factor in student effort. For example, a tired and bored student is more likely to lose focus and be less attentive than a well-rested and pleased student. The Facial Action Decoding System has the abillity to detect boredom. Dr. Huang stated , ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" He sees the educational benefits to students if his software were used in a classroom. Students would be able to stay focused longer and continue to do so without boredom. A happy student would be much more willing to learn with a software that kept them focused and happy.

With the Facial Action Decoding System in a school, or at home on a PC, everyday computer activities will get more and more interesting. For example, digital advertisements are just about everywhere nowadays, and some of them can be annoying an even disturbing. However Huang's software can process the facial reaction of a user to determine which adds to allow them to see. ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" Huang predicted. Putting a software with the abillity to do this would benefit students and teachers. Ad's can pop up in school that may not be appropriate or have anything to do with a desired subject. If the reaction of the student teaching that subject is negative, the ad will not be seen again. On the other hand, a teacher could find an ad that would benefit a lecture or teaching segment, and more educational ads will appear.

Others claim that the idea of a software that constantly watches a student's face is bizzare. They claim that humans can already detect when something is wrong with a student, or if they arent participating well. While humans can observe a student's emotions, it is not as precise as Huang's software. Given that some may be feeling well but prefer a calm and relaxed demeanor, humans will not know what these students are feeling at the time. However, the software will use all of the facial muscles to determine how these students really feel emotionally.

Huang and Sebe's Facial Action Decoding System truly demonstrates how facial motions can show mental feeling. This is why it would be extremely beneficial to have in schools. Students and teachers would get to experience a fully customized day at school based on their emotions for that day.

The Facial Action Coding System can help students learn something new: for example the muscles in their faces.

dbf756e,"I think that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" may actually be valuable. The machine detects emotions from using a picture and that can help with knowing how a person feels. The machine uses the muscles in your face to detect your emotions, it calulates all emotions found, and has most of the common emotions so the FACS has a very good chance of being accurate and valuable.

The machine uses the muscles in your face to detect emotions. This is useful because different muscles makes different emotions, In the article the athour explained how the machine can tell if someone was happy or not. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" That explains that even if the person tries to change their emotion the real one will still be seen because of the muscles that they are using.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" calulates all the emotions found in the persons face. Since the machine can calulate all the emotions it has a better chance if getting the right exact emotion the person is feeling and get all the emotions. This machine would be about to detect how any person is feeling and can show up at 6 emotions.

This shows how many differnt emotions she had and the machine was able to pick them all up.

The Facial Action Coding System is usefully when it comes to trying to figure out someone elses emotions. The machine uses the muscles in your face to detect your emotions, it calulates all emotions found, and has most of the common emotions so the FACS has a very good chance of being accurate and valuable.

dbfb38b,"to my opinion i think that we should not be practiceing to find out a eay if we could use a computure to read our emotional expressions. to my point of view as a student i woldnt like if s computure would look at me nd say oh shes feeling happy. because computers does not have a soul do when i hear that they should have computures to se if they can read emotions well i think thats is redundunt. now as they said in the story paragraph 3 sentence one, they can begin the process when the computure constructs a 3-D computure model f the face; all 44 major musclesin the modela must move like a human muscles. now in other words make a robot that looks exactly like a human and can do human things. i think that why are we trying to make robots to be like human do we serously want another thing on this planet that might ruin it even more. now some people believe that we should have robots to help us etc. but they also say what if they become evil and they go against us and take over the world and kill us all. i think that if they ever make robots and that were to happen then it was all planned because this bings me back to my point. robots dont have souls which means that they cant procces haterate in them. unless they were programed to feel hate but they are sensative so if they actually learn how scientist wants them to learn then i believe that they still wouldnt take over the world unless they were programed to. i think that if a student actually thinks that it would be nice to have the computure read your emotions and you could talk to it and stuff then i feel lik that would seperte our world even moe ut this time is seperate from eachother from our closest friends and family because they would become our friends and they will become our family. i think if you want to end bulling and family problems etc. then is still not a good idea. like i said this still leads to segragation within ourseleves. so if ou ask me do you think that we should make robots to read our emotions. i would just simply say no its to complicated and learn to comunicate with people to fix problems and dont try to be the ruler of evrything cause you will fail and if the world ends ill blame it on you.",2,7,0.6049582362174988

That being said it can also be just as effective in the classrooms as well.

Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

In paragraph 2, the question asks ""How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movement we humans use to express how we feel?"" Paragraph 3 then goes on to explain the answer to that question. They said that the process begins when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Eckman. This doctor classified 6 different basic emotions.

I claim that the technology doesn't do anything with the Mona Lisa because, she is smiling in the painting because, it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomine confused or bores"" in the text. While looking in a mirror, you see your own reflection of yourself because, it says ""Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth bacause, technology can't do that. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (""crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes"" in the text.

I conclude that the technology can't support the smiles of people's faces because, there are muscles, tissues, and cartlige in the humans head. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corner of your mouth.

dcda789,"Personally, I feel that the technology called the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable. It may seem interesting that a computer can tell what emoitons someone one is feeling, but it doesn't make it valuable. We can also tell what emotions people feel too.

This technology that they are using only calculates what emotions they feel. For example, in the first paragraph it says, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" They've used a computer to analyze what the Mona Lisa was feeling in the portrait. The computer predicted but is not all accurate. She might have felt more fearful than happy. Most facial expressions are universal. That meaning, that if someone smiles you can't think right off the bat that they are happy. They may feel hurt therefore not so happy as you thought.

What's the point of the technology if us humans can tell how a friend is feeling, based on the look of their face. We may not be 100 percent accurate, but we may know how they feel. For example, say you've known someone for a while now, you would probably know what their expressions look like. The only thing you won't know what their thinking but you will know what they feel. Another thing we have an advantage on, is the way our friend speaks. Emotion isn't just based on our looks, it can be based off of the way we speak too.

On the other hand, I also feel that the technology can useful too. I feel that it can be well used in painting espically in a portrait. I say that because it can be difficult to see what a person felt in the portrait. The technology that they use can be used to scan the portrait and tell us what they might have felt. It can go though a deep scan and could scan the 40 major muscles that we have on our face that shows our expression.

In conclusion, I personally feel that the technology called the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable. Eventhough we can't fully tell what somone is feeling we can still predict. The technology that they use is also predicting. It's just more accurate. Therefore it's not all that useful to us.        ",3,7,0.8707523941993713

FACS can have many different effects on an individual person. One example would be ""...in a false smile, the mouth is stetched sideways using the zygomatic major and...the risorius....these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". Using the FACS people could tell whether or not someone is lying; this is especially helpful if the person lying is and important politician that could one day be leading a country.

FACS could also be used to help understand emotions better. ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"". This could help people better understand one another. Say there are two beggars living on the street one of them is a real beggar with no money and the other is faking it just to get more money; FACS could be used to identify people who truly needs help by studying their facial muscles.

dd41e75,"FACS or Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions so when they used it on the Mona Lisa it said that she was eighty three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearfu, and two percent angy, in which I dont think is true. What I think about FACS is that we dont need it and that what is the point of using it when we can just figure it out our selfs. So for that I think that FACS is not needed and that it should have been invented for something else.

There are many resaons so why I think that FACS should have not been invented to figure out the emotions of pictures or humans. One reason is that they have to begin by making a 3-D model of the face in order to figure out the emotions which I think is a waste of time and the use of the 3-D printer and because all fourty four major mucles in the 3-D printed model must move like human mucles. Also it says in the first paragraph that when they found the emotions of the Mona Lisa that they say "" at least according to some new computer software"" which means that theya re not one hundred percent sure.

My second reasons is Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise. anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, but then Dr. Huang has said that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal which make the whole thing confusing because Dr. Eckman said six and Dr. Huang said that their are many more in those six which makes it more complex because they have to had figure out those other ones.

Another reason that I think that we can just uses our brain and eyes for find out there emotion or just tell them which is better that using a computer to figure that out. In the artical its says "" Perhaps Dr. Huangs's emotion algorithms are different sort of "" Da Vinci Code"" which mean that they probable have not figured it out yet which can lead to having wrong answers.

In conclusion I think that FACS is a thing that we do not need because you have to go through many steps which can be a waste of time and also that they may have not completed to figure out all expressions which can be tough and because we have the ability to figure emotion out our self and not in need of a computer to help us. That is why I think that we can just use us and no computer because we have the ability to do what we can do.       ",3,7,0.7361546754837036
dd4c541,"Facial Action Coding System is a potential and valuable way to read students' emotions while in class. Through the use of this technology, it could bring forth various opportunites. The system could open doors to the genuine thoughts of students to let adults better understand a view into their minds . Utilizing this technology will illustrate a positive change to the school by giving instructors insight to a students mental health, engagment with certain topics, and learning style.

The mental health of a student is a vital piece of information that a teacher should know. In the text, the author states that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that too"" (Alto 6). By writing this, he conveys to readers that the software can process your emotions. Therefore, if a student demonstrates a pattern of unhappy emotion, an administrator can then speak to the student and find out what might be going on in their home life or if they need to see a counselor. If a computer could give insight to happy or sad emotions, what other emotions could it detect?

The knowledge of how a student learns or the level of engagment they have within the classroom is a key component to modifying lessons and ensuring the most enriching education for a certain individual. Within the article, Alto inserts a quote from Thomas Huang, a professor, in which he says, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (Alto 6). This means that opportuinities for a student to get a more indivualized education increase, and teachers will have the ability to revise lessons in order to adjust to level of understanding majority of students have. It would also create a tremendous chance for the students who are falling below average to be identified and recieve the propering tutoring needed. Would these new adjustments then lead to a better understanding of learning styles?

Each individual in a classroom has a unique way of learning that requires attention and adaption on the lesson in order to fully let the student reach their potential to excell with their education. The author claims that the technology could, ""...modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Alto 6). This gives the information that the system could be able to analyze the way students learn, and give access to various learning styles of their student. This would enable them to then adhere to the students education needs, and therefore open doors to make break throughs with children that had been struggling.

There are many factors to consider when contemplating the use of this technology in the classroom. Although, the overall result of putting this system in place would be positive. The ability to detect students emotions will enable instructors to teach more attentively to each indivdual student, causing the childs achievement level to rise snd their education to strengthen. Enriching education and making it personal to the student will in time increase passing test scores, the number of college graduates, and literacy rate. Schools should consider encorperating the FACS technology in order to obtain a brighter, better future for their kids and country. ",5,7,0.912296712398529

Well now that may actually be able to happen. A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), has come up and has the ability to detect emotion through subtle expressions of your face. Something like this could be a huge asset for a classroom, and getting students to engage with their own learning.

The FACS system can help a classroom in a variety of ways. A quote from the article states ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions"" (D'Alto). This shows how the software can recognize different emotions at the same time. By weighing which emotion is effecting you the most, the software can then modify your lesson.

Another way for FACS to assist a classroom environment is the ability to modify a lesson based on your facial gestures. The article states ""A classroom computer could recognize when as student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'alto). This quote explains how the software can recognize when a student is confused or bored, and best determine how to modify the lesson in order to more benfit the student.

Another reason, specifically for an Anatomy type class, is the software's ability to make facial gestures, based on surgery. A quote states ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery"" (D'alto). This quote shows how students who are performing surgery, or are observing, can perfect their strategy to allow for the least amount of pain from their patient.

Why use a computer? Using a computer to find people's emotion is uneccessary because Alto mentions the brain does this calculation everyday with even more acurracy and it will help build comunication skills and put oneself on a deeper level of thought. There is a person that this boy likes or has a crush on and he wants to talk to her, but he doesn't know what to say. Later he notices that she is obviously down about something, and he walks over to her and says ""Hey, are you alright you look kinda down?""

Also it could help teachers more on understanding their students so they can buils a more positive and stable relationship. By knowing what people are feeling it could effect the mental state of the mind and body and not cause stress.

Overall the effect to this product would be not having the ability to actually depict how one is feeling without using the coding system which could make human intereaction almost artificial.

Humans are wired to be able to tell the emotions of another person. Humans dont even have to see the actions of a person before they know the emotion they are expressing on thier face.

The technological advantage of computers being able to read emotions can be dangerous. Machines with ""personalities"" could use the emotion scanning technology to their advantage. They could do so by decieving us into doing bad things. Machines could also use the information given to copy our facial expressions. If they copy our facial expressions the robots could communicate on a wholenother level.

In conclusion the technology to read emotions through facial expressions would not be valuable to students. Since humans can already know the emotions another person is expressing, the computer detecting the emotion cant change it, and machines may be able to use it to thier advantage in the future the technology is not valuable to students in a classroom. This technology is not valuable to anyone at all and should be destroyed.",3,7,0.8279112577438354
df380ff,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" the auhtor explains the development in new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that enables coputers to detect human emotions. As humans do this almost everyday attempting to figure out the mood of the people in their surroudnings.

Computer technology is now able to do the same actions but on a higher level inclduing percentage and specific musclesthat induce the face of happiness and other emotions. This technology in a classroom reading the emotional expressions of students would be very valuable becuase teachers can adjust the lesson accordingly, they can help them and try to relate the lesson to them, and they could act differently according to the person's mood.

The first reason why this technology would be useful in a classroom is so the teachers can adjust the lesson accordingly. For example, if a teacher had planned to talk about Romeo and Juliet which is a morrid tradegy inclduing death, they could switch the lesson and avoid conflict if they knew a student was sad and possibly had a death in their family or relations. If the tecaher had gone into the lesson talking about the death and such upsetting events they could have upset the student and made issues. Another example would be if the teacher saw the student was not understanding the material they could explain the lesson in a different way. One of the main reasons for schooling is to learn and this could help teachers teach their students more efficently. The teacher would know if a student was confused and they could provide them assitance.

The second reason this technology would be useful in a classroom is so that the teacher could try and relate their lesson to the studnets so they understand it better. For example, recently children are very drawn to technology. If students in an english class were reading a book and their homework was writing a summary over each chapter some wouldn't complete it becuase it's 'hard' or 'boring'. If you flip the perspective and have a class twitter page and the students would tweet each day something about what they read they would take to it better. A teacher could see that a student is very happy they do do a lesson that is along the lines of knowing what happiness is and explaining emotions. If a teacher tried to do a lesson like that while their students were sad they could most likely not explain happiness.

The third reason this technology would be useful in a classroom is so that the teacher could act differently according to the person's mood. If a teacher was planning on having a debate in class but then realized that some of their students were already angry and flustered they might change the plan. The students would go into the debate angry and it would only make them angrier resulting in the class getting out of control or hurting a student's feelings. If a student comes in and the teacher notices they are sad and upset they won't be as harsh on them. If the said student had a missing assingment that had to be turned in the teacher could wait until the next day or aproach them in a kind and understanding manner. If the teacher hassaled the student about a missing assingment when already upset it could escalate the situation to an uneeded extent.

Many people focus on their emotions and feelings, teenagers at a higher level than most. People are led to act on how they feel about the situation or in general. Emotions lead the world and without them it would be a boring and grimy place to live. In many situations multiple peoples feelings get hurt becuase they say something to a person in a bad mood and the person explodes on them. School inhabits alot of stress onto teenagers so if thier teacher knew how they felt it could help them all. This technology in a classroom reading the emotional expressions of students would be very valuable becuase the teachers can adjust the lesson accordingly, they can help and try to relate the lesson to them, and they could act differently according to a person's mood. Emotions are a large part of a tenneagers life and if schools could help reduce stress, help students comprehend, and help rather and hurt the students emotions the school systems could have a largely more postive impact.

This software is an innovation from Prof, Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Sciense at the University of Illiniois.

dff8a22,"Knowing It All -and Changing the World

Although humans often think of themselves as ominiscent, it is sadly not the case when it comes to reading emotions on human expressions. In this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, the author describes the abilty to detect humans' emotions through a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). By the use of this system, educational expreriences can be enhanced globaly; therefore the use of FACS to read emotional expressions of students in a classfroom is vaulable.

FACS is a reliable system that can scientificly read human emotions accurately. The software is developed by credible professors, ""Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Insitute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois"" and ""Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam"". A system created by two college professors promises the credibility of the software, for professors often are valued as a unbiased, credible source who dedicate themselves into new innovations and such. Also, the complex programming of FACS adds another layer to the reliability. For example, the software ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles"" which must behave and ""move like human muscles"". This anatomical system suggests the high accuracy of this system, for humans tend to read emotions soley based on the basic features of the human face such as lips and eyes while on the other hand, FACS is able to analyse the all the muscles in human face and draw a conclusion based on its calculations. Therefore, this well-developed system must be valued to read students' expressions in a classroom for its accuracy and reliability.

FACS is not only able to classify the six basic emotions but also identify mixed emotions of an individual. FACS relies on ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" to identify ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". This suggests the software's advanced ability to read human emotions soley based on facial expressions but also the practicality of FACS. The accuracy of this software will allow teachers to know, change, and enhance the educational system based on how the students react to certain methods of teaching. Often, teachers are not able to read students' emotions because they are focused on teaching the material. However, through the use of FACS, this software can distinguish how the students feel without disrupting the class while the teacher can focus on teaching the material. Furthermore, FACS can identify mixed emotions as well. For example, using this system, Mona Lisa by Da Vinci was found to be ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". This perplex programming suggest its ability to recognize human emotions in details, which can be used to allow a detailed analysis of the educational system and transform it in order to make the eudcational system more practical and enjoyable at the same time.

Although the evidences are evident and clear, some might bring up the concerns regarding a 'fake emotion'. However, FACS is abilty to detect fake emotions as well. For example, it can detect when ""zygomaic major or risorius"" is moving, and depending on the muscle, it can identify the falselyness of the human emotions. This system can spot a truthful or not untruthful faces, and base on such emotions, it can be used to alter the educational system into a better one, therefore the system must be valued.

Many doubt about the capability of the modern educational system. However, by the use of the latest technology called Facial Action Coding System, the educational system could be altered into something at a different level in terms of practicality and helpfulness all around the world. This system must be valued to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom for such reasons, and the world might be changed by this.    ",5,7,0.8728899955749512

e036b6a,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa smile"" the author describes how a new technology Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think this technology would not have much use in a classroom. There are so many emotions that go on in the human brain on a daily consistent basis, there is just no possible way that artificial intelligence could make an accurate reading on a student. For example humans are not these focus machines that only think about school work while they are doing it, a student could easily get side tracked and think about somthing else, whether it be a sad or happy emotion this could theoretically set off the Facial Coding System and give the student an inaccurate reading. Another real life example is, say a student is working on his math problems and the student totally gets the problems and it is a breeze, but say he gets sidetracked and thinks about something else earlier in the day that puzzled him, what if the Facial Coding system picked that up? It clearly would not give an accurate reading, hypothetically it would pick up the students confusion and move him onto another question. The problem with the Facial Coding Systerm is that it wouldn't be analyzing a perfect subject, what I mean by that is that humans clearly have error, what I mean by that is if the Facial Coding System were engaged on a student I feel like it would have a hard time getting an accurate reading on how the student is ACTUALLY doing on their school work. Not only would this system most likely be very inaccurate, but what about the cost of the Facial Coding System. Technology and artificial intelligence like this would be outrageously expensive, so not only would this system most likely be ineffective but it would also be very pricey, imagine the thousands of kids in each public school, then add the expense of the coding system on each of their computers, school funding may not even be enough to fund all of that let alone the students who would be paying for them, it is just not realistic at all. In conclusion I think that the Facial Action Coding System would be both an ineffective and expensive product that schools certainly could not utilize or benefit from it at all.",4,7,0.7938318252563477
e046c43,"While the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto talks in great depth about the science behind how we make certain expressions and what a computer can do with that, the author does not mention what is really causing these emotions, whether it is happiness, anger, or disgust. However, the truth behind emotions like these is human interaction. Without it, a person might not feel anger or sadness, but they might not also feel happiness or joy. One movie called ""Interstellar"" shows a character who has spent years on a foreign planet without the ability to communicate with any other human being. When he is finally discovered, he mentions the horrible pain and loneliness that stemed from an absence of other people. Technology and robotic machines are being slowly integrated into every part of humans' lives, and perhaps there will be no more need for certain professions to be filled by actual people. While the use of the Facial Action Coding System might prove to help identify emotions, it would not be worthwhile in a classroom because it would require one-on-one interaction with a teacher and even transform the classroom into a robotic impersonal environment.

Even if the program would successfully be able to indetify emotions in a student, it would be near impossible for a teacher, robotic or otherwise, to react to each individual students' feelings. Perhaps the technology of facial recognition will eventually become efficient enough that it can read the emotions of a person in less than a second, but what good can this really do? A teacher only has so much time every day to interact with his or her students, and definitely not enough time to talk in length with each one individually. Dr. Huang, an expert mentioned in the article, tells the reader, 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" But what if there is only one student in the back of the class who is confused? The teacher cannot be expected to slow down the whole lesson for this one student and force the rest of the kids into boredom. The only time this might actually make a difference is if the entire class, or almost everyone, was confused and the teacher would then take the time to explain the lesson in greater detail. However, most teachers today already have the ability to read their students' emotions. It is not hard to discern when a full room of high schoolers, for example, needs further clarification. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.'"" However, what he does not mention is the other portion of nonverbal communication: body language. That is, body language outside of facial expressions. A very large portion of the way humans express themselves is through body language such as crossing the arms across the chest, bouncing a leg when he or she is bored, etc. Technology doesn't have the capability to analyze this yet. Perhaps it will someday, but for now, attempting to bring this program into the classroom would be unnecessary and potentially expensive and time-consuming.

Additionally, for this program to be most successful, teachers would likely be gradually phased out and replaced by virtual or robotic instructors, an idea that, while perhaps more efficient, will create an impersonal environment in the classroom. Using this program or not, there is no doubt that many people have speculated about the use of robotic teachers sometime in the not-too-distant future. Even Dr. Huang mentions it in the article when he says, 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" The use of this program would encourage the replacement of human teachers. However, is this really the best direction to go? If a random student was asked to think back to their favorite class period, it is fairly plausible that they would mention something about an actual teacher. Maybe the teacher participated in a fun activity with the students or told a funny joke. Either way, the experience of interacting with real human teachers is simply irreplacable. The author, Nick D'Alto, later goes on to state, ""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" As mentioned in a previous paragraph, human interaction is one of the most significant reasons humans are capable of feeling true emotions. Ask anyone what their best memory is and they are almost certain to mention something with another person whether it be a family member, spouse, or close friend. Empathy, as D'Alto touches on, is essential to feeling emotions with the people around one another. So much of these necessary actions would be taken away once real teachers are replaced by artificial ones. It would take almost all remaining enjoyment out of school and form an environment in classrooms that is lacking feelings and is uninviting.

In summary, integrating the Facial Action Coding System into the classroom is impractical and unnecessary. That is not to say that the program does not have many uses in other areas of the world, but its uses in the classroom are minimal. It would waste time and effort for a result that is not notably helpful. Perhaps the developers should first focus on its other uses such as on a website or in video games instead of in the classroom. Schools do not need programs like this and they will only eliminate the living breathing system that is already in place.",6,7,0.8604646921157837

For example if a student is having the emotions of being happy, sad, angry, or even disgusted about something the machine could really help let someone know that the student is having these emotions going through their body.

e0a82f7,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. There are many ways that this can and cannot work. It would be great to have the students potentially have the best classroom experience possible, but that is not always the case. The system is a great idea, but it may not work for everyone. After all, it is technology, so it is not guaranteed to work one hundred percent of the time.

Many things can go wrong with the FACS. Not everyone has the same shape of face or the same shape of muscle in their face, so can it really tell the exact emotions of everybody? Computers are great things in our world, but they do not always work the way you would want them to. This software would most likely have bugs and glitches for a while before they even come close to perfecting it. Many things can go wrong.

The article states that humans perform these ""calculations"" everyday. Why do we need a computer to calculate our emotions when students can go to a classroom and have an actual human teacher? The article provides much great and helpful information and pros to this software. Logically thinking, people can come to the conclusion that they do not need a computer software such as the FACS to cope with their emotions. The FACS may be valuable to very few people.

The FACS is just showing how people are not developing the social skills they should have. In the article, Dr. Huand states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". Students should just go to class and have a real human teacher so they can ask them for help if they are confused or bored. Computers should not have human qualities that sounds ridiculous. Dr. Huang also never mentioned what the FACS would cost either, it could be hurting peoples' pocketbooks.

The use of the FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. As stated earlier in the essay this is what real humans are for. This is also coming from a high school student who does not take online classes. This software would not be much help to the students who go into school everyday and see real life teachers and not computers. Dr. Huang could have mentioned much more in this article, he focuses on all of the pros of the software but none of the cons. The article is quite biased and its purpose is to hype students up for a cool new software. ",5,7,0.8939330577850342
e0d868d,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify 6 different human emotions: happiness, anger, surprise, sadness, fear, and disgust.

This program has been tested on Leonardo da Vinci's art of the Mona Lisa and has proven its accuracy.

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because most students are afraid of asking questions, a teacher can see if the students are comprehending what they are teaching, and they can tell how the students feel on an emotional level.

As students get older their courage of asking questions diminishes. In the article Alto says, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions.""

When students are afraid of asking questions they often display many emotions. When one is confused they can feel frustrated, disappointed, and helpless.

If the student is unsure of a certain a topic and is afraid to ask questions a teacher could quickly tell and have more time one on one with that person. Although some might say students should learn to not be hesitant of asking questions we must take inconsideration that some students do not have that level of confidence and won't in a long time. By going next to the student and helping them, the student should feel reassured and probably gain more trust in the teacher.

The Facial Action Coding System is essential when trying to learn when students need questions answered in different subjects.

Another benefit of the Facial Action Coding System in schools is that teachers can have a better idea of what to work harder on when teaching. For instance Dr. Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""

This would allow for a teacher to know what amuses their students and they could try to implement that technique in further lessons. Students hate being bored and learn better when they are actually enjoing what they are doing. In contrast, teachers might think that knowing if the student is actually enjoying the activity is useless and unimportant.

By being aware of the students' engagemne t teachers can improve their teaching styles and thus students can learn more efficently.

Knowing the emotional state of your student is important when trying to guide them and teach them. Dr. Huang states, "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.""

Students usually are not open about their emotions but still need to be reassured that there is someone there for them.

Some might argue that knowing their emotional state is not something that they do not need to know. However, school needs to be a place where one feels safe.

Having the Facial Action Coding System in school could help alleviate bullying and help students emotionally.

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because most students are afraid of asking questions, a teacher can see if the students are comprehending what they are teaching, and can let a teacher know about the students emotional status and well being.

that would be unseen for there to be a computer of any such to even exist.

the other thing is why would there be anything that has to reand a persont feelings thats not the why it should be in some case we all assunc some time how he person is feelings every are has there won why of showing that emotins in different waya.

This idea can be actually kinda wierd too because you can be on the computer just minding your own buisness but also knowing the computer is watching your every move to detect your emotional expressions. One thing I do like about this facial action coding system is how they use science to make this work. Proffessor Thomas Haung says that the computer constructs 3-D model of the face and it scans all 44 muscles of the human face and can tell what your emotional expressions are. Another good thing about

this technology has that is pretty good is that when your on the computer and the technology is scanning your emotion , that can determine the ads that pop up , so if an ad pops up that you dont like and the technology can detect that you dont like it the next ad will be something that you like or will be even better. I think this is pretty good for advertising because advertisers are always trying to figure out what people are interested in , want or need and what puts a smile on their face. Overall I think

this technology is pretty good to me so far based on the information I am given. Other people may disagree with this technology and may not like it because not everyone wants there expressions to be known or used because some people may want to keep there feelings to there self. At the end of the day this technology hasn't been realeased to the public yet and people haven't had a chance to use it yet, but until then this is just an idea.",2,7,0.8152183294296265

It sometimes can be use for just certain things and if that person gives you permission to look at the Site, then yeah it can be used to determine how they are feeling. Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology but some other people may also think that is just as same as other technology. For example, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This means that this technology mostly works only when your smile like it said on the text. Yeah it may be awesome to other people but like i said it should be banned because there is no point on having that techology if that person tells you how they are felling.

e288d9b,"What if we always knew what everyone was feeling? It sounds like it would be great if we could always detect one another's facial expressions. However, every human being has a different individuality which sets them apart from everyone else. That individuality is what makes that person unique, and can effect the way that a technological device percieves them. Everyone thinks differently, learn in different ways, and expierence different things.

While it seems like reading the expressions of one another may be a good thing, you cannot depend on the technology when you do not even know how accurate the technology is. By the way that the technology is described, it seems that the process reads one's emotions based off 6 basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. However, humans feel much more than these 6 emotions. We can feel emotions such as confusion, passion, and boredom. If the technology is basing some one's emotions off those 6 universal emotions, the data cannot be completely accurate because those emotioins do not work together to create boredom or even confusion. The feeling of confusion is a comeplelty different emotion, it is not affected or made up of one's happiness or anger. A person cannot detect confusion simply from reading only 6 universal emotions.

""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'""(D'Alto). While that would be particularly useful in an academic field, it may not work as well as anticipated. Every human being is unique and different, so therefore, they can become confused for different reasons or get bored of different things. What one student may find boring, another may find quite interesting. If that lesson plan changes for the student who is becoming disegaged in the lesson, it will affect the other student who use to find the lesson interesting, it may cause that student to then become confused or disinterested. That is a flaw with technology, it cannot benefit everyone equally because every human being is uniquely different and can be affected in different ways.

Many tend to hide their true feelings simply because they do not want others to know their true emotions. To read students' emotions in that way is an invasion of one's privacy. When people are sad, they hide that feeling because they either do not want to think about what is making them sad, or becuase they do not want to make the people around them sad as well. Reading the facial expressions of people, especially those who conceal their emotions, is similar to reading one's thoughts, which invades their private thoughts and emotions. When some one is hiding their emotions, that is their private feeling and should not be shared nor invaded unless with permission granted by that person.

All-in-all, the technology cannot be proven to be accurate since it can only read 6 emotions and many people expirence a much more vast variety of emotions, than the simple 6 universal emotions. Including the fact that everyone is unique in the way that htye think and project emotions and thoughts differently. The technology also cannot change the plans for students effectively since a change for one student could harm another student academically. And finally, to read one's emotions, including the emotions that they conceal would be invading their privacy. People hide their emotions for a reason, and those emotions should be kept to them, they should not be read because they are considered one's personal thoughts. ",5,7,0.706361711025238

Teachers could know how there students feel about the topic there learning or how much the get it or not.

Another one is when your a manager at a store you can see how people feel about your store if theres alot of stress going on in their head.

The text states that "" Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them "".

Which means it helps them com alive in the real world.

If your sad and was to put on a happy face it would probably help you get happy or to get a better attuide for the day. In this story it says a "" Drama couch, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emothions on stage"" to better them when they had to come on stage infront of people to peform. The actors had to make it come real for people to enjoy it. He would also put them in other peoples life to see what there emotional state was and how they were feeling.

The muscles are called "" orbicularis oculi par palpabraeus"" these muscles are acting when you get mad,sad,happy,frustrated and other emotions. So yes, i think you should have this in the world to see what people are feeling around you . It can do what computers can do . Like if you were to smile at a ad they could bring it up to make you even more happy or to get you to buy something. If you were to frown you would get a ad to help you smile or to laught.

When Eckman said that he classified 6 emotions and gave the example of what controls what, the problem arises as in that it maybe false information due to a blank type of facial features that are unreadable. Also, if the person is capabale, they can hide their emotions by faking a different facial feature to put forth a positive type of vibe in such a way machines cant read. This is most likely going to backfire and have mis information due to errors and exploits. Emotions arent an algorith, they reflect us as a human and shouldnt be exploited to some company to make some big bucks.

The human is a complex entity to study because we are adapting over time so much, we change on a daily basis and thats what is the issue, if we were all like minded, then it would make sense a robot can understand us.

e34416f,"Facial Action Coding System allows computers to identify human emotions. Websites could use this technology to keep people interested in ads. Teachers could use this technology to identify the emotions of students in the class. I believe that the use of this new technology, on students, would be an invasion of privacy.

Most students do not want their emotions to be known, especially by a teacher or their classmates. Emotions are meant to be something that is willingly shared by a person, not taken from them by a software. If a teacher believes that a kid is confused or bored, then they should ask the student not a computer. Often an emotion that is felt is not shown on the outside. A person might look completely uninterested, when in reality they just naturally look bored.

The Facial movements do not tell every emotion as it truely is. Some emotions are easily confused while others are an odd combination. A person cannot always show their true emotions plain as day. There are disorders that give people permanant smiles or frowns. Some people naturally look angry or sad. If all emotions were clearly stated by facial movements, then there would be less confusion in the world.

Dr. Huang said that a computer could change a lesson based on the emotions that a student is ""expressng."" (6) If a student appears confused during a lesson, modifying it for that one student is a terrible idea. Classes are made up of more than just one student. If a lesson is changed because one kid is looking confused, then a few more kids might not understand anymore. It is impractical to try and keep every child interested in a class. If a computer kept changing the lesson because one kid was bored, then the entire class would never learn anything.

Logically, computers that are used to detect emotions in a class and change lessons beased on that are impractical, illogical, and a hinderance to learning. Students can ask a teacher to explain a lesson in a different way, but a teacher will not change an entire lesson based on one student's needs. There are many other resources that schools can use to help kids excell, but invading a child's privacy by analyzing their emotions is not the correct way to go about it. ",4,7,0.9133129715919495
e3499a3,"A facial action coding system sounds very confusing. A software that can detect emotions. Could this be useful in the classroom? I say not yet. I think it could be valuable but not now because it is not devopled well enough yet.

The value of a teacher being right in front of you is not matchable. Many people learn different ways and a lot of them like a teacher teaching them instead of a computer. Kids, like myself, learn better when a teacher is making sure you stay on task. The idea of a computer being able to change its lesson based on your face and emotions sounds cool in theory but sadly the computer will not be able to keep the student on track and focused on school work.

Another issue with this technology is it has not been tested futher them just on a painting according to the article. The facial system needs to be tested further until they plan on rolling it out to online schools to be used in. So far all we know is it can detect a face on a painting very well but we do not know how well it would work on a student. The program could even read the students face wrong even if the student did not want that to happen. That could cause huge problems for the student when they like a lesson but the program read their face poorly and it changed the lesson.

In conclusion I think the technology is certainly cool and could seem usefull but I do not think they have researched about other uses as much as they could. Once the technology is perfected then it could be used in online classrooms but I do not see the uses for in a regular school yet.          ",3,7,0.8518979549407959

e3d327c,"""Facial expressions for each emotion are universal even though individuals often show varying degrees of expresions"", as observed by Dr. Huang. A new software called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The process starts when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the person's face. Each characteristic movement of our facial muscles is associated with six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The use of this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it will help teachers know when their students are confused, awares the teacher if the students are going through something, and help the teachers make learning more enjoyable due to them knowing when the students are bored.

This new software can be useful in a classroom environment because it will help the teachers know when their students are having difficulites or are confused. There are times when students are too afraid to speak up about not knowing the material because others might find it more simple than them. The Facial Action Coding System will allow teachers to know when their students are confused about a topic, and it will help them give that student the assistance they need. Some students can have difficulties when it comes to learning new material and take longer than others to grasp it. This new software will be of great use in the classroom because teachers will be able to offer help to the students that need it or direct students who do understand the material to those who don't. The system could also be used to notify the teacher when their students do understand the material, so they don't continue to go over it and be able to move on. Overall, this system will benefit both the students and the teachers.

Another reason to why this new system will be valuable in a classroom is that it will allow the teachers to be aware of other emotions the students are having besides confusion. Some students could be dealing with issues at home, and when they come to school they aren't in the best mood. When students of any age are dealing with an event or issue, it can affect them when learning.

The Facial Action Coding System could be used to detect a students emotional expressions, and in doing that it will allow the teacher to give his/her students the attention they need. When students have the right mind set, they are more prepared to learn and give it their all. When students are filled with sadness or even anger, they will not make the best decisions both in and out of class. Making sure the students are an environment where they feel safe and comfortable is important, and this new software can be of great help with that.

The Facial Action Coding System could also be helpful of letting the teacher know when his/her students are bored, so they could find a way to make it more enjoyable. There are students who have more trouble learning when the material is presented to them in a lecture format. Many students learn easier with more hands on activities or discussions. When students become bored in class, they can tend to get distracted or stop paying attention. The Facial Action Coding System can be used to recognize when a student is becoming bored or unamused with the lesson. This will notify the teachers that they may want to try new ways of presenting the material, so that their students don't get bored and stop paying attention. The system could also let the teachers know when their students are actually entertained with the material or how they are teaching, so they can continue to do it the way they are. When it comes to younger children or teenagers, it becomes harder for teachers to keep them involved and listening, so it is important to keep a classroom and teaching simple and enjoyable for the students. The more they want to learn about the material, the more they will understand it.

Although this new system is of great use, it is possible that it is not the most reliable. As humans we are a more complex system to understand at times. Emotions are difficult to control at times and even understand. As individuals, especially at a younger age, we can have trouble understanding our own feelings and how to deal with them. At the end of the day it is a machine that is telling you how you feel, and it cannot always be accurate. It can be helpful in many situations, but we should still be carefu with how credible the data is.

The use of this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it will help teachers know when their students are confused, awares the teacher if the students are going through something, and help them make learning more enjoyable when the students are becoming bored. This new software can be of many uses in a classroom environment, and it can better prepare students for the world around them. Technology has changed and advanced over time to the point of being able to recognize emotional expressions on people.

Within this time span it is easy for students to lose attention and not focus or just get confused. using the Facial Action Coding System it can show the teachers how well they are teaching. If it shows that the students are not quit getting it, the teacher can have them stand up walk around or go get a drink. In paragrpagh six it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""

""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" The Facial Action Coding System would reduce the amount of time it takes to resolve a problem with a student. If you know exactly how they are feeling you can give them what they need to cvhange thier mood. There would not even be communication. You can just look at all his emotions in the system and know how to fix his emotions or change them.

The system can also tell if they are comfortable with the people they are around or what they ae doing. If someone is not comfortable they wont do their best work. So, if you can see that they are uncomfortable with the system you can move them or ask them why they are uncomfortable.For example, paragrapgh five says, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instnace, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Humans can tell a little bit of emotion but, not 100 percent of it and what to change of it.

In conclusion, i think we should have the Facial Action Coding System in all classrooms. It helps with telling students emotions. Whetther they understand the informatiion being given.

e4fff57,"A new technology called Facial Action Coding System claims it can scan a face and tell how much of each emotion the person is feeling. There are some negatives and some positives to bringing this new technology to personal computer. The author of the passage seems to only give a positive outlook on this system, when all aspects should be explored. The negatives to this technology would not be the end all be all of this product, but they should definitely be taken into account for the creation of a better system.

The Facial Action Coding System is a computer software that scans a face and recognizes what emotions are being displayed on the face. It uses codes to see which muscles are being used to move a face. For example there are certain muscles to show anger like the orbicularis oris which tightens your lips. The system uses these muscle movements to determine which emotion is being displayed and/or felt.

Although there are a few negatives to the FACS, it could potentially be a useful product. The passage says that the Facial Action Coding System could be used for relevant advertisements and a more engaging classroom effect. This system could be very helpful for ad agencies that don't know how to reach their public. If a computer scanned a face the instant it sees an ad, researchers could figure out whether or not to show an ad again. For example, an ad for cat litter with a picture of a cat could potentially produce a smile or a look of disgust depending on a situation. If the person doesn't own or like cats their face would not show happiness, and the ad agency could show a different ad. This system would also aide online class courses. If it was constantly scanning a person's face, the creator or teacher of the class could modify which sections seem to bore a student.

The system may be helpful, but the negative sides to it should be also considered. Because the FACS can only guess what someone is feeling by what is being displayed on a face, it could potentially be inaccurate for people that are prone to hide their actual feelings from their faces. The FACS only does an outerscan, it never sees what is happening in the brain. A scanner of the brain would be more accurate, expecially for people that can not or do not want to show their true emotions. Another possibly negative fact about this system is that it would need to constantly be scanning a person's face for accurate readings. This could become innacurate if used for a very long time. If it were used for an online course, the system would need to be running during the entire class, and the person could get distracted and show emotions for the distraction that are not relevant to the class. This is also potentially invasive, especially for a company using FACS to show relevant ads. People might not want to constantly be scanned for their emotions. There would be a paranoia of always being watched and unless the software company promises the facial recognition would never be used for anything other than for the ad display or for fixing a class, people would feel uneasy.

It seems evident that the author of this passage is giving the readers a positive look into the new Facial Action Coding System, but it should be taken into account that there are negative aspects to this software. People may not always want to be watched for their emotions, and the system could become inanccurate. Although it seems that the passage points towards effective and positive outcomes, the negative criticism should be taken into account and modified for a better FACS. ",4,7,0.8310281038284302
e52a741,"I am against the value of using the Facial Action Coding System because some people may try to hide a feeling like be upset or sad because they don't know how to tell someone why and how they feel. Just because they are hiding what they feel doesn't mean that someone can take new technology and found out what their feeling, because if they wanted people to know how they felt they would.

On the other hand if you use the technlogy you could change a lesson if a student was becoming bored or confused to help them do better in school. This technology could help more students pass classes so they can graduate. But some may not like the thought of someone being able to look at a computer and finding out what they are feeling.

They need to respect what people feel and not try to figure what is wrong because they didn't want to tell. If they found out they person may get upset and by confused at what happened. Using this could cause people to be disapointed in what people are feeling. This could cause people to get angry at others. Just because the technology exists doesn't mean that you have to use it.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding Stsyem shouldn't be use. This is because people may not want others to know want they feel, if they did they would tell them. But if they just told they wouldn't need the Facial Action Coding System. Some students may be struggling with things and may talk but what they are feeling but if they are confused they could just ask for help. Just because students dont show their feelings doesn't mean that they won't when they are ready. You should let people express their feelings at their own time not by using technology that could tell what someone is feeling. Using this technology would cause to be frustrated even more because they can't tell people what they feel on their own because the technology would tell people ins't and not when the person is ready to tell people what they feel.

According to Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe you can tell how people are felling through a computer. The computer can scan your face and tell you if you're happy or sad. This is very interesting considering not even humans can tell exactly how you feel, but a computer can. There would be very mixed emotions about this throughout the world. They use all 44 major muscles, movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"".

In the article they talked about putting this in schools. This could be very useful in many schools. If teachers knew how everyone felt by just looking off a computer screen it'd help them a lot. Most teachers can't tell how they feel all they can do is ask and students can easily lie. So if the Facial Action Coding System was programmed in all the computers in the school it'd be very helpful. In the article it says that it can even tell if they are faking emotions by the way the muscles move. You can even use this program to see the emotions off pictures and paintings which is insane.

This program could be very valuable in school classrooms. Teachers could tell if a student is undertanding it or not or if they are just bored or angry. This could help education a lot across the world. The longer they work on this the more emotions they could get the computer to scan. The teachers could see what interest the students and what students don't enjoy learning about.

Most teachers go off of what most kids want to do and some kids just lie and say they want to do a certain thing so they look cool. This program could show what every kid in the class wants to do by scanning their face. Which is so valuable for teachers.

I agree that using technology to read students emotional expressions is valuable because you can communicate more with your expression not just with people but also with computers. For example from text,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communtication,""notes Dr. hang.""

It helps students because it shows the computer your emotion when you don't understand something and it's like a teacher seeing your face while you do work on something sam way it works on a compueter. Text from paragraph 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"",Dr. hang predicts.''

In conclusion this invention is revolutionary program will have a huge inpact in every social aspect. The world wont be the same every thing will be diffrent because we will now what the presedent is really thinking and when he is lying or when he is scared and then we can better protect our selves .",2,7,0.44253724813461304
e603fea,"Do you think it would be easier for technology to do the work for the teachers and identifying their face expressions during lessons? Some think it would be better ways for humans and computers to communicate. This could be a big step for the future.

In my attention getter or introduction, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" This shows that someone somewhere can be inventing something like this to help students in the future and can also upgrade technology into a better cause.

Facial Action Coding System also knows as FACS has been invented by Dr. Paul Eckmen, ""The process begins with the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" (D'Alto paragraph 6). This just shows the way it works and how it has to be human muscle movements, Eckman has also classified six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

Overall, the value of technology should be for a better cause and can help many people in different ways such as students by looking at their facial expressions on a teacher's lessons if they don't understand the topic. This is another way it can change to computers and humans to communitcate.",2,7,0.8767402768135071
e6149d1,"Well for the facial expression software it is a good way to look at someones faical expression. In the story there are many ways to look at someone and then they know how you feel. its all in your facial muscles they move on the way you feel. by the way the software can look at art to find out how they would feel. its a spectacular way to look at technology.

The feeling of sadness can be shown when your frowning. the muscles on your face can make a frown. The way the computer software works is by scanning the muscles on your face. so you frowning causes your muscles to move and create a frown. the way of scanning is just a little process and then your done.

Say for the expression of happiness it can be scanned. the computer will track the way you look and the muscles on your face. the smile on someones face can be detected by the scanner. The smile actually uses less muscles than the frown. the smile can be felt as a feeling and that is one way people who do drama perform.

The facial expressions are a unique thing for everyone and it is a good thing for people to feel in its correct moments. the scanner can detect them from the muscles on your face. also the way you can be also used to be shown just like the mona lisa smile.",2,7,0.7836323976516724
e67b702,"Ever heard of using technology to read students' emotional expressions in a classroom? Of course not, because it is not necessary. What good would come out of scanning a student's face? The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" does not give many reasons on how this technology would benefit people. This technology is also a little confusing with giving information. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is unvaluable because it serves no real purpose, would cause confusing emotional problems, and we shouldn't have to rely on it.

By human nature, we can already tell or sense how someone around us is feeling. Why would we need the technology of reading someone's face when we can do that by looking at a person? Maybe not always, but for the most part we can tell when someone is feeling down or happy. In paragraph 5 of this article it states, ""...we humans perform this same impressive ""calculaion"" every day... you can probably tell how a friends is feeling simply by the look on her face."" This supports how this technology is not exactly needed.

""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Which is it? Is she happy or angry? Why is she disgusted and fearful when she's mainly happy? This technology would describe several different emotions that one is feeling. Because of this, it would be confusing to really understand someone. In paragraph 4 it states, ""Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly)."" This supports how people do show various emotions, so it would be confusing, whereas without the technology, people can question each other and converse.

Why rely on this technology instead of actually communicating?

We are people, and in a classroom, bonds can easily be made. Therefor, we can talk to each other in order to discuss emotions. Paragraph 6 states, ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" Even though having this technology where ""it could modify the lesson,"" would be helpful, it's not something we can't do ourselves by talking. Paragraph 6 also states, ""...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows the technology would be beneficial in a way, but it's not valuable nor necessary.

This technology to read the emotonal expressions of students in a classroom is not valuavble due to not having a good enough purpose for use, it's confusing; almost unreliable, and we can communicate without it. In a classroom, we should be able to express our emotions without the technology. We can verbally discuss topics and share. This technology would not be as valuable as a good teacher, tutor, or instructor. ",4,7,0.8590461611747742
e731a0d,"Is technology that can read your emotional expressions usefull or valuable? How can this benifit the classroom? A computer being able to read your emotions doesnt seem pleasent, but it could benifit you. Maybe if the computer can tell if your feeling a certain emotion such as anger, it can help settle you down by bringing up something of your interest. Or in a classroom, if a student becomes bored or even consused and the computer can sense that, then the technology could pop up a instructer, to help the student concentrate.

How do you know that a compuder reading your emotons is safe? Studying of emotions have been practiced for decades, mostly starting with Mona Lisa, the painting done by famous Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo studied human anatomy to justify and express certain emotions on well known art pieces. Emotions can be very unpredictable because people have so many different reactions to certain things.

The Facial Action Coding System, an innovation from Prof.

Produced at the Beckman institute for Advanced Science in the University of Illinios. This technology was made by Dr. Haung and his colleagues. This technologgy was invented to help computers and humans connect more on a personal level, helping the computer undertsand more, and to better help the human. The technolagy can construct a 3-D model of the face in the systen and predict certain emotions by little behaviors that the person does. Such as, rasing your eyebrows when you suprised or interested, and tightening around your lips when your emotion is anger. While some people my be for this, others may feel againt that kind of connection between technology and a person. Others may feel danger with that sense of curiousity. If a computer can sense a ceratain emotion and can possibly change that emotion, you dont know if the computer would cause you to feel worse, or even isolated. There could be a glitch in the systen that could cause danger to the person. Or even a hacker could be able to go through a computer, causing a virus that can make other people look through your camera. With the pros also come the cons, through if this type of technology is used approprietly it could really benifit society.   ",3,7,0.8654276132583618
e74239f,"The human face itself can determine someones expressions within seconds upon looking on the person. You dont need no computer telling you whether if they feel happy or whatnot. It is a waste of time and money to buy the technology and put in time for basic things we should know as humans. The human face is easy to decode by your own self.

as in the article is says lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry by just a computer telling you these things but not off facts but off programs it was given to work. its programmed to tell whether you are feeling this or that its set off a data base of emotions all in one. the article even states theyre all just calculations and not fully correct theyre going off basic emotions.

therefore i see as in it not being valuable to profit in. you dont need all this to decode a persons face. you dont need a man made program just a for a computer to tell you what you already know. people arent just subjects to test on for emotions you gotta know this in life. take the hints, and gesture.",2,7,0.8070026636123657
e76990c,"To start off, I think the technology to read emotional espressions of students is vulnerable because in todays society not a lot of people are great at socializing, their faces and actions speak louder than theirown words. Basically saying that students and teachers should know somethng is wrong with the person just by looking at their face and the expressions they're portraying.

In the article it states that the peoples faces don't lie and that this is a pro because it helps detect wheather a person is lying or not. On paragrapgh #8 it sites ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Clearly, right there it states that we could know wheather a big person we look up towards to like our president could be lying to us or not just by simply using this advance computer technology to recognize human facial expressions. This is also a gret opportunity for humans and computers to develop better ways to communiacte. It's a great big step forward in society too. If you're not great at expressing how you feel verbally maybe you're better just facialy expressing it without saying a single word. This amamzing technology can even identify mixed emotions. In the article it staes that ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" says Dr. Huang. This means your computer could know how you feel without saying a single wrord. I also think this an advanatge to school consuelors because students sometime have trouble in school and don't really like to talk about their feelings.

To conclude, I think the technology to read emotionals expressions should be vulnerable to students and the teachers as well. Why? Becasuse a lot of people can struggle with anxiety/social problems and they just need somepone to talk to but just don't know how. This is why computer science is helpful to when it comes to situations like this. ",3,7,0.7114171385765076
e76e2af,"The using of of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding Systems should be used to read the emtional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This technology can help many students in need without having to ask the teacher or professor for help. The students wont need to feel ashamed about asking a questionfor help because with this technology it'll make things more clearly for you to understand.

In the text it states it explains to you how this new technology can scan your facial recognitions and can tell how you're feeling. First the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face and all 44 major muscles in the modele must move like human muscles. In the text it states, ""Eckman has classified the six basic emotions which are happines, surprise,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" All these emotions are associated with the characteristics movements of your facial muscles. Some examples he talks about is when you're surprised your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes are raised; another one is when your orbicularis oris, around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger. This software can identify misex emotions and each expresion is compared to a neutral face that shows no emotion.

This new technology advancement would be able to recognize one's emotions but we can't always rely on technology. For instance we don't need technology to know when a friend is sad but we can just recongize their expresions by simply looking t their face. This technology can also be misleadng, In the text it states, ""A classroom computer could recgnize when a student is becomine confusef or bored..Then it culd modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor."" Yes this technology can read facial expressions but can they truly understand why we are feeling this way or whats going on through our head. We can be in class learning a lesson but you can be confused about not what you're learning but of something else that's going across your head. Like any other technology. this new technology can work both ways a student it can either help them or bring them down.

Much of the human communication is nonverbal which includes emotional communications, so computers need to understand that too. This technology is basically based upon the muscular action units one gives away. In the text states, ""They even indicate the difference between a geneuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sude ways using the zygomatic major and and a different muscle, the risorius."" They say faces don't lie, so this technology would be able to read even the fake smile you put on.

The Facial Action Coding System may help the students in many different ways. It can help them with a lesson that they don't quite understand or confused about. It can recognize if youre truly happy or faking or any oter emotions you may be feeling. Yes you know how you are felling but this technology can help give you the confidence you need. This system shows how it can improve one's life by it understanding your facial muscles that give away your expressions. You won't be ashamed to ask questions nor be laughed at because this technology will help you without you realizing it. While you're confused on the lesson this technology would modify the lesson like an effective human instructor so you'll understand the lesson mre. ",4,7,0.8608623147010803

e7e826b,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the use of Facial Action Coding System technology to read the emotions of students ina classroom is valuable.

This is shown through the author's description of the benefits of being able to read expressions of students, as well as the increased understanding of emotions that can be uncovered due to this technology.

Recently, Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague have developed ways for computers to better communicate with humans through a program designed to calculate noverbal human emotions.

This technology has proved able to recognize expressions of humans, and so has expanded the frontiers of human communication with technology.

In particular, this advancement could provide benefits in the education system.

The reading of expressions in studnets would prove beneficial to the educational process of understanding what content best suits a student's learning ability.

Dr. Huang predicts, ""A class Room computer could recognize when a studnet is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6).

This shows how the technology would allow a computer to effectively ""recognize"" a students emotions, and correlate or ""modify"" the corresponding lesson to better fit his or her learning.

It would provide an ""effective"" tool for intructors to be able to better understand what their student needs in order to succeed.

Expressions or feelings such as ""confusion"" or being ""bored"" would allow teachers to better invest time and effort in teaching topics that best fit with these emotions, and so it would help make teaching easier in response to the needs of students.

The technology would also continue to increase knowledge of human emotions through interpretation of the many expressions such as nonverbal communication.

In turn this would help with the education of students, as an increased understanding of human feelings would allow the system to acknowledge issues or needs that specific students have.

Being able to match their emotional abilities with the best subject for them to succeed in would be an option.

This would provide teachers with a system that best maximizes potential and limits issues in the classroom that involve expression or emotion.

D'Alto writes, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto 3).

From this we can see that if implemented, this technology could help identify primary human emotions such as ""happiness"" or ""anger"".

This would allow computers to identify ""characteristic movements"" and translate this into emotion.

With this technology at our disposal, we can better understand how people in general portray their feelings through the anatomy of their face, and better understand the identity of these emotions in the physical aspects of expression.

This understanding would in turn allow students and teachers to better understand their emotions, and so best match their tendencies to educational programs or classes.

Continuing with the idea of better understanding emotions in the technology would also prevent issues relating to student behavior such as academic honesty or problems with stress or anger, as understanding the emotional expression conveyed by students would help implement systems to better prevent these unwanted actions.

For instance, the author writes, ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle... To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"" (D'Alto 8).

This is an example of the increased benefits of this technology, and particularly pertaining to education, it can be used to detect whether students are being honest or ""truthful"" through their expressions.

Although it is not guaranteed, the technology would still provide another option in understanding what studnets feel or what they are truly going through.

It would allow schools or instructors to change their teaching or development programs in order to relieve studnets of unwanted emotion, and it would also help benefit the disciplinary system, as being able to detect true emotions could help distinguish one issue from another.

Overall and in conclusion, a better understanding of human expression by technology provides an improved tool for instructors to help with the learning and development of students, as this allows them to fit learners' studying emotional tendencies with that of the best option or way of teaching.",4,7,0.8676073551177979

e88655c,"The use of technology to determine the emotional expression of students in a classroom is not valuable. I personally do not think that a computer can analyze a human face and determine in percentages what their emotions are. A human can not be 2% angry and 75% happy. A computer can only determine what looks like on the outside, but not in the inside.

We humans can guess by looking at someone if they are upset, furious, meloncholoy, or estatic. Humans can determine that by their body character or their facial expressions. We cry when we are angry, sad, or happy. A computer could not know that. We ask how they're feeling and most of the time humans can lie about their emotions. They tend to hide them within a smile or a laugh. People may look angry, but that's their natural face expressions. In a room full of students, you are going to get many different emotions depending on what time it is during the day. If it's the morning, students will most likely be tired or sleepy. If it's around noon they may be hungry. During the afternoon students will most likely to be ready to leave school. The time of day can have a mega impact on a person's mood.

A computer may have an estimated guess on a person's mood, but it will never determine it. Us humans are special. We have many different ways we express emotion. We may feel many emotions at the same time, but a computer system could not determine that. We change how we feel all the time. We may not express it either. The FACS system may mistake our emotions through one picture. They could see a picture of you crying and decided that your sad, but in reality you're crying of laughter. In my opinion, you can not decide the expression of Mona Lisa just by looking at one painting. If they had a document saying she was happy most of the time her portrait was painted, then would believe it. Since they don't, I don't believe in anything FACS has documented.

The use of technology can not determine ones emotion(s). Only we can decide on what we feel or how others feel. I strongly believe that we are the only ones who can see emotion. ",3,7,0.8057158589363098

This technology that can read emotional expressions will make learning better.

The process of the computer reading your emotions starts by making a 3-D strcture or model of your face.Using video imagery thenew software reconize and treacts the facial movements. It uses all 44 major muscles in your face. It reads the movement of the muscles to detect weather you happy, sad, scared, angry, suprised, disgusted. It then takes those emotions and apply them to the movements of your facial muscles. An example from the text is ¨Your frontalis pars laterails muscles raise your eyebrows when your suprised; Your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger.

Facial expressions are universal, they are also being used so the computer can give intresting things that you would like. an example from the text ¨ A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.¨.

If your smiling when an web ad appears on your screen an similr ad might follow, But is you show an unhappy face the same ad will not appear next time. Most human communicationg is non verbal and that is something that is hard for the computer to understand.

Humans preform this calculation that the computer is trying to do on a day to day basis. For intances as it says from the passage¨ humans can tell how their

friend is feeling, Most would have trouble describing each facial expression.¨. That is something that Dr.Huang has made an algorithm for. The algorithm will be cnstructed to read the muscular movemnets of the facial structure and create an respons suited for they expression or feelings.

This essay was to inform you about the different ways computers are being advanced. Our technology is being shaped in many different ways, The most modern way is the reading of an facial expression made by a person from a computer. This technology will be used world wide it will help education, entertainment.

e95a2a6,"Technology is extremely helpful in our everyday lives and is a great way to interact with people. We use it to gather information and learn, as well as overall communicating with people all over the world. But do we really need it to guide us on human emotion? Emotional technology could actually keep us from understanding people on our own, and could make us too dependent on electronics.

Do you have a friend or family member who always knows how you're feeling even if you're trying to hide it? Analyzing other people's emotions is a good way for people to understand eachother and to grow close with one another. But technology takes away our ability to do that on our own. The author of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". This is clearly a way to show how humans minds naturally can do the same job as the Facial Action Coding System. If humans rely on computers and technology to tell us how we or other people are feeling, we don't need to figure it out on our own. And if we are always relying on technology and not using our own experiences and analytical skills, then we will eventually lose our abilities to understand others on our own. People in the modern day are already very dependent on technology, we can not let it tear down our social skills. Having an emotion generator can slowly tear at people's social skills and will make us less able to relate to people. Identifying other's feelings can give people a sense of closeness, understanding, and relation to that other person, and if we constantly rely on technology to do those things for us, it would seem as though we are losing connection from person to person, and are making it a connection from person to technology.

Some people believe that technology is keeping us from the simple things in life, and we are more engaged in our cell phones than engaging with people or nature or any of our surroundings. So in that particular case, would using technology to read people make us to connected with electronics, or would it allow us to further connect with people? The answer is fairly simple. Nobody knows you better than you know yourself, and that means that nobody knows people better than people themselves. We have been able to read people's faces and emotions since the beginning of time, and are still currently able to. No technology can read the psychology of humans as well as humans likely can. So why would we add the element of technology to interfere with person to person contact? It is important that people are able to associate with other people without depending on other resources, and including technology to help us would in the long run actually hinder us. A person had to understand humans enough to create this kind of technology, so instead of making everyone dependent on technology, why don't we allow people to understand humans more on their own?

In conclusion, although technology can be useful, technology determining emotions could effect our generation in a negative way. Humans were born being able to understand basic human emotion, and we should not take away that skill from others through relying on technology.      ",4,7,0.7611420154571533

However, it is clear that this technology has a great amount of value because it helps us better understand the muscles in our face, it improves communication between people, and can improve the quality of faces in computers.

First of all, the experts of the software are constantly experimenting on different parts of the muscles in our face. By doing so, the experts are better understanding the part's of the muscles. On paragraph 3, the author cleary states that, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This shows that the experts have noticed these odd movements of the muscles. The muscles function similarly to legs. Also, on paragraph 4, the author talks about how this new technology can even detect ones mixed emotions. The evidence that he uses is the painting of Mona Lisa. The painting was filled with different types of emotions such as 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Next, the technology has played a major role in improving our communication between people. On paragraph 6, the author shows us that most communications between people is through nonverbal. The technology can help ones understanding of emotional communications, thus improving their nonverbal communication. The technology can tell when someone is zoned out or just completely bored. On paragraph 6, the author states that ""A classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This machine could better the communication between teachers and students.

Not only does this machine improve communications, this machine can improve facial expressions in our games and our technology. At the middle of paragraph 6, the author states that ""The same technology can make computer-anmated faces more expressive"". This will improve the quality of our video-games. Video games will become more vivd and realistic. Also, in the medical field, this improves the video surgery. With a better video surgey, more lives will be saved.

Lastly, the facial technology will and has played a major role in our lives. This machinery is a huge technological discovery and should be continued. This is because the technology has helped us better understand our facial muscles, has improved nonverbal communications between people, and has improved the quality of our computer-animated faces. This technology can play roles in almost every thing we do. From video games to hospitals, this machine does it all.                       ",4,7,0.8215801119804382
e964d63,"In the article, facial recognition software called the Facial Action Coding System allows for computers to better understand and identify human emotions. The software was created by Dr. Paul Eckman, who is a psychologist. The FACS technology is used to analyze several muscles upon the face to determine the current emotion of the person or people who are using the software. Many feel like this technology could possibly be used to change up the education system by analyzing the faces of students who appear bored or uninterested in the cirriculum that is being covered. But, the cost to run and maintain the systems that are needed to run the FACS within schools and other facilities may create an issue because it is costly, and not everyone is going to have the funding to put into such a system.

In a classroom, every student is taught the same lesson and given the same lecture in the same exact manner as every student sitting around them. Their faces, just like any other human being, can determine their current emotions towards the subject they are learning or the topic that they are covering. FACS has the ability to analyze all 44 major muscles in the human face, which are responsible for showing emotion every single day. Dr Paul Eckman, a psychologist, created FACS to analyze the facial muscles on the human face and determine the current emotion of someone behind a computer screen. Along with Dr. Eckman, Dr Huang explains how facial exprssions play a role in human emotion, ""The facial expressions for each human emotion are universal"",oberserves Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling broadly). With the invention of this technology, some feel that it could change the educational system by analyzing the emotions of a student towards the subject they are learning.

In the article, Dr. Huang explains how a classroom computer could analyze the emotions of a student during a lesson or lecture, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" And while this may seem like a good idea, the technology used for FACS cannot be run on a home PC due to the complex algorithims that it uses, and the results may be the same for school computers, which run on similar or less capable software than that of a home PC. This is mentioned in paragraph 7, where it explains the same reasoning why the software cannot be used on a home computer. Another possible issue could come when schools do not have the funding, nor the room for computers in every classroom to adjust the education system. While the technology may be an innovative way to change how students learn, the cost to update compuers, install software, and manage it would be very costly for a school system to continue with doing.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding system is a great way to enable computers to communicate more clearly with humans, but may not neccessarily be ready for common use within schools or other places just yet. The algorithms used in the sofrware are too complex for most operating systems used within homes and schools, and may need further development before it is released to the public for common use. In addition, the idea is good for the future, and may change the way the education system works for generations of students to come. ",4,7,0.8410794734954834

It also will help if they see a student unhappy or depressed we can tell there parents that they should get help to see if there ok. Also it can find if the students are understanding the work and so they can help their fellow students with work.

The facial coding system might help know if the students are being bullied to see that they are afraid to go into the classroom and help the student stop the bully from hurting him. this technology could also help to see if there will be any trouble makers if they have a smirk on thier face and see that they will do soming bad.

The use of FACS to read expresions given off by students would be valuable because it is very advanced in technology, can scan a real face or a picture of a face, and can tell if a person is being truthful.

the use of FACS to read expresions given off by students would be valuable because it is very advanced in technology. ""For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens up to show anger."" (paragraph 3, lines 27-29). FACS can read the smallest detail produced by the human face and connect that to an emotion.

e9e1f6a,"The Facial Action Coding System would have value if used in a classroom. Not only would it benifit the teachers, but it would also benifit the students as well. The Facial Action Coding System in a classroom would have positive effects.

Applications of the FACS within a classroom are varied and vast. Just one use of FACS would be a survey. The student or teacher could be shown a video of controversial topics while the FACS would scan them. You would already know their thoughts about it without even asking them. If you wanted to perform a group survey, you could see the difference in their emotions when surrounded by friends and when not. And if the FACS wasn't fully tested, you could survey people and then compare the answers of the FACS and of the person. And even if none of the FACS surveys worked, there is still a chance that the survey subjects could learn more about human emotion. Even the world as a whole could gain from the FACS and learn more about human emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System could also be used on a much broader term. It could be used for online internet use as well. Virtual Reality could be integrated with FACS to create a more accurate representation of a person's face. Not only would that be amazing by itself, but it could also get humanity closer to full-body VR.

The FACS could help students and teachers realize their own emotions better about simple things like homework, or even eachother. A student could be playing an educational game to learn a new language. The student is trying his best, but the question is too hard for him. The camera would see this in his face, and change the difficulty of the question.

Although there are potential flaws with using the FACS technology, the positives completely outweigh the negatives. One potential flaw is that we could end up relying too much on the FACS tech and eventually won't be able to see human emotion by ourselves. This isn't a problem though. If we don't use the technology out of laziness, we will retain our social abilities, like empathy.

If we could have FACS technology integrated into classrooms, the positive possibilities that could open up would be so benificial for mankind, the internet, other students, parents, and even teachers.                ",4,7,0.7497889995574951
ea158b1,"A classroom with the use of this technology would be a classroom of supieriority. This new techonology could greatly improve students´ abilities to learn. Often students are protrayed as being happy or content during a lesson, but really, they are confused. The FACS, Facial Action Cosing System, is an advanced piece technology that can help students with their school work and can be very valuable in the classroom.

The FACS is a computer coding system that allows computers to be able to read the facial expressions of humans. According to the passage, the process in which the computer recognizes the feelings of a human begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face. Each and every muscle movement of the face can detect the exact emotions of any person. For example, the zygomatic major, a muscle that begins at the cheek bones, lift the corners of the mouth when someone is genuinly happy. The FACS system is incredible at calculating any person's emotions and can cause the computer to adapt to anyone's liking.

It is not unusual for a student to ""fake"" their way through a lesson just to make it seem like they are ""okay"" when really they are misunderstanding everything that is being taught. According to the passage, this new techonology system is able to recognize the facial expressions of students as they work through an assignment on the computer. It interprets if the student is understanding the material or not. Through a slight frowny face or a confused face, the computer can tell that the student is not able to comprehend what is going on. In return, the computer program may change the lesson to make it slightly easier on the student until it detects a content face. This face will trigger the computer so that it is able to recognize that the student is now understanding the lesson. The program can act as an individual instructor for each student in order for the student to meet their needs.

From this technology, the student will not only have an advantage, but the teacher will as well. Instead of individually tying to speak to kids if they need help, the computer can do it for them. Sometimes, it can get tough and frustrating for a teacher to try to meet the needs of each unique student. With the help of the technology, students can obtain their specific needs on their own. This will relieve a great deal of stress that teachers may carry on their shoulders, and would be very beneficial towards them.

The FACS is a valuable piece of technology that can assist many in the classroom. Lessons will be adapted to meet the students needs when they are confused, becasue the facial recognition program will pick up on their moods. Also, teachers will no longer need to try to teach the lesson several different ways for each different student to understand it. This program greatly advances the students´ learning and acts as a helping hand for teachers.       ",5,7,0.823986828327179
ea16a1a,"Why they invent Facial Action Coding System? Well in my personal opinion this is a good experiment for student, family, etc, because sometimes people do not want show they emotions or feeling, for example: If a girl of school that has depression or personal problems and she do not want talk abaut that with her teacher or consuler and this girl is thinking in kill herself, if the school have the Facial Action Coding System the professor can save her life, that a great experiment, but one thing is all school can't have it because are expense so this experiment can't help to all students or families that need.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, the Dr. Huang says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" he is trying to said that they experiment is not just for people, he is says that is universal so that mean is for all that have face or that the Facial Action Cording System can read emotions for example:The Facial Action can read the Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa.

The advanced technology could help modify a lesson on a computer when a student is showing signs of boredom, help with communication skills, and tell whether or not a person or celebrity is lying due to facial muscles.

In paragraph 6 the article explains how if the ""Coding System"" were to be in computers in classrooms, it could help modify lessons for students who get bored. Dr. Huang states ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor,"" and this technology could help ""make computer animated faces be more expressive for video games and video surgery."" Also in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too."" meaning that in day to day life humans interact by facial movements or gestures so if computers could read those expressions and gestures, life could be made easier. Finally, in paragraph 8 it reads ""muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risouris."" showing how ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" So in the classroom if a student was being untruthful the computer would be able to detect when the student is lying due to their facial muscles.

In conclusion, the technology to read students' emotional expressions known as the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is helpful and valuable.

eaacc19,"I think this technolgoy to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable because it wont just help the

teachers and but the students also, by helping us read our friends/peers how they are feeling. It will also helps the teacher know when we are getting uninterested on the subject. Not only that but also its really awsome and interesting to know

how the process goes.

Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr.Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles for it to work properly. Eckman has classified six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness,which then they are associated each with characteristcs movements of the facial muscles. But this technology does not just help with a real face but also in paintings. It even helps you know what the person is

feeling in the painting.

Some of us can probably know how to tell how your friends are doing just by looking at her facial expression.

Of course, some of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Just imagine to know how your friend is feeling, for example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different, and you get to know all this just by your school computers, Dr. Huang predicts. "" Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure,"" said Dr.Huang. We all have that one friend/friends that when you ask them "" Are you okay?"" they always say ""Im fine,"" and they say it so neutral with no emotions. That's how you know that they are lying and they just dont want to tell you, this is when this Facial Action Coding can come in handy, to just tell you if your friend is okay and just a little irrated thats all. Its like how Dr.Huang said ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.""

In the end I think the new technology ""Facial Action Coding,"" can come in handy once and awhile. Its all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.

According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.

We all want to know how someone is feeling whether its a friend, family, or even a stranger, we want to help them but we wont know how unless they tell us how they are feeling in the first place. I think the new technology is a good idea it will help us alot but remember sometimes its just as good to know how someone is feeling as it is to not know at all. Dont get carried away of knowing how everybody feels becuase we still need privacy and sometimes we just like to keep our emotions to ourselves. Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitata another person's facial expressions. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!   ",4,7,0.8895688056945801
eab2b06,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom setting. While at first I seemed a little skeptical about the idea, as I kept reading I realized that having a software that can read emotions of students in the classroom could be great. It could be a wonderful teaching tool. If a computer can read a students facial expression then theres no doubt in my mind that this is a valuable technology to have. There are some really great uses this technology could be used for to help students. Having this technology in classrooms could help students who are confused, upset, or afraid to ask questions.

If the software was correct about the emotions in Mona Lisa's face being ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" then the software is really good at what its supposed to do. If the software can recognize all of those emotions from a painting then why couldnt it be put to use in a classroom. The software could recognize if a student was confused and try to give the student easier problems to try and work them up to the more difficult problems. Or the software could just show them websites or videos that teach the student how to do the problem they are confused on. If needed the software could just ""modify the lesson."" The software could also help a student who is getting upset that they arent getting a correct answer, or that they don't know how to do the problem.

If the software can recognize when a student is getting upset at a problem, it could notify the teacher so they can help the student. Or the software could just help the student work through the problem. The software can try to calm the student down. If the software is successful then the student can go on with the problem. Or if the software can't help then it could just take the student to another problem entirely.

When the software can read fear or worry on a students face with confusion or anger the software could realize that the student doesn't understand the problem, but is too shy to ask for help. The software could find extra help for the student on the internet. It could find the student some practice problems. If needed the software could even find a video explaining how to work through the problem. As a last ditch effort the software could notify the teacher that the student doesn't understand the problem.

I dont think the Facial Action Coding Software can do all of these things to help out students now. I do think in the future that it should be used in a classroom setting. This kind of technology could be really helpful in making sure that no student is left behind. If the software would be put to use in the classroom it would need some extra work put into it so it can do what it needs to in order to help students.

eabad33,"Nowaday, the world of technology is really big all around the world. People start to use technology for everything in their daily life. From their house, their school or work. Phone, laptop, computer, cars, etc. Each day a lot of inventors work hard to produce their invention to make the world better. Recently, iphone company just release a new iphone called iphone X that you can unlock the phone without using your finger, you can just look at the camera and the phone will recognize your face and open it for you. That is a really popular invention that everyone excited to buy and love to use. People create many new technology for it to communicate with humans like iphone X as an example. Thomas Huang professor of University of Illinois collaboration with Nicu Sebe professor of University of Amsterdam created a software called :""Facial Action Coding System."" The software were created because Dr. Huang said that he want to develop better ways for huamsn and computers to communicate. The software can recognize humans emotions. Either, you happy, sad, fear or surprise, the computer just look at you and tell what is your feeling right the way. Because Dr. Huang is a professor at University of Illinois, beside the software he just look like every professior that have to go to class and teach. As many people know, not every time you attend the class you understand what the teacher teach you. Sometime you get bored, sometime you get confused or tired. But all of that emotions you are the only one that know about it. With that in mind, Dr. Huang wanted to bring the software to his class so he will know his lesson is actually go through students mind or not. He will know the time to change the topic to make student more productive, more happy and enjoy in his lesson. Not just only him, every teacher in the world need this sofware, everyone want their students to happy to learn. More happy you are, more focus you are in the class. The Facial Action Coding System is a valuable software for school that help teacher recognize students feeling and that can make the class better.

Here is how it works. According to the article ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles"" This show that, we can believe in the result of the software after its read the emotions. Because the computer created a model of the face, with all muscles that humans has. When you move your face the 3-D model of the face will form exactly the same as your face to help the software recognize what is that emotion. One of psychologist and creator of FACS that work with Dr. Huang is Dr. Paul Eckman has classified there are six basic emotions :""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" That is what emtions of a regular humans looks like. Either you happy because you got good grades, or anger because someone ate you ice cream that you save for a long time. They bring every emotions of humans in real life in the software to help help it easily recognize humans face. One of the example from the article is when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you are surprised, or your orbicularis oris (around your moth) tightens your lips to show anger. The computer is really smart, just look to your face and form the 3-D it can easily show how mad you are, how sad you are. Even from the painting Mona Lisa of Leonardo da Vinci, the computer show she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fear ful and 2 percent angry. You can see how smart it is. If you mad and angry or surprise at the same time, the computer will still know and point of the percent of each emotions. When you make a fake smile, the software still recognize it. According to the article ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" You cannot lie to them, they already know exactly how you give them fake or real smile. Go back with Dr. Huang classroom. Why is FACS is a valuable software for study at school? Because when you are tired, bored or mad about something you cannot focus on the lesson or what the teacher or proffessor teach you. From that the computer will recognize your emotions and tell the teacher your feeling. Teacher cannot make you forget about your problems but they will create or find another way to make the class seem more fun or do more activities instead of just standing and read ore teach boring stuff that you don't care about. That's help you feel more comfortable, in that way when you feel happy and relax you can focus on your work more. All of the stuff that you learn will easily come to your brain and you will remember it.

The FACS is a great software for school. It can help teacher/professor a lots in their way of teaching students and from that students will focus more on the teaching time. Not just classroom, this could help many people around the world with whatever they do. Because sometime, humans being never tell anyone about their feeling, they just sad and angry but noone now about it. Using computer to communicate with them is a great ideas. Like an example in the article, when it recognize your emotions and know that you sad, it will find an ad or something funny that can make you laugh right the way. Since many people around the world using technology all the time, people should create more things that could help technology communicate with humans. Because it could help the world more modernized, help the people without family or friends feel better when they communicate with technology. Growth more technology will make the world better.

People show their feelings by showing their facial expression towards others, but some people just wont show how they feel with facial expressions, they might express their emotions through words.

Emotional expressions are not always a true version of a person's feelings. People some times pretend to express something else then how they really are feeling inside. Everyone has gone through the same problem of having to fake a smile and pretend to be happy, but in the inside you might just feel awful. Also, there's no reason why a computer should tell us how we're emotionally feeling, the paragraph shows how a student gives his or her parthner directions on how to move the muscles to smile, which it shows that by looking at the muscles on someone's facial expression we can aslo tell their emotional expressions.

Facial Action Coding System is a ""3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human mucles"". It has to move all of it's muscles in the 3-D computer to determind a facaial a human is making while using the facial gagit. We come across basic emotions like sad,anger, happy, and more that this gagit says can can pick up when scaning peoples faces, through the Facial Action Coding Systems. It even says in phargraph 3 ""Eckman has cassified six basic emotions--- happiness, suprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness--- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"".

When Knowing that, i dont think the mushcine could tell the students' emotion in a classroom. I only say that because, the Facial Action System can always make a slight mistake on judging how someone in that classroom feels. Just think, yes people can see others faces and make thier thoughts on what the person maybe feels, but also sometimes their judgment is wrong. I know the acticle tells me, and the other readers ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facaial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect Yet Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facaial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" (in pharagrah 5). I still say it doesn't matter about the studies someone has done to, or on something, technology can make simple mistakes just like humans.

In parapraph two, you can even see the author asking the readers, ""Can we actually ""cauclulate"" emotions---like mathe homwork""? Then goes on with saying, ""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel"". When saying that it just shows that the author, and probly others that have read this acticle isn't sure about this facial computer tool, looks can always be desiving so it hard to even trust technologys judging something simples as someones facial expression.

Some people just may think the Facial Action Coding System is a very great idea, and some may not think so. It's just to hard to get a good answer on whomevers feeling it's the right technology to use.

This technology is valuable because we can actually determine what or how someone is feeling. However making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotions. Alot of us human beings hide our emotions either because of what other people might think or because

you dont want them to feel empathy for you, which is feeling someone else's emotional state. There's also a big lack of human communication. For example, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr.Huang.""So computers need to understand that too.""

Yes i know everyone is like how can we acually calculate our emotions or how can a computer recognize the facial movement that we use to express how we feel. I have prove from the article,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"",...all 44 major muscles in the model(face) must move like human muscles."" That detects whether its a human or not because of the muscles in our face. Even if we dont have the system just by looking at someone when they are sad there's a frown, when they're happy abviously a smile, etc.

The system and us humans can also tell the difference between a fake and a real meaningful smile. In the cite it states,"" In the real smile, the zygomatic(muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth."" And in a false smile,""..,the mouth is stretched sideways

using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" Using this system would really benefit all of us in whether there's no communication then with the system you'll see why.

Another example would be the Mona Lisa Smile theres alot of emotions going on its a pretty confusing picture if you look at the details pretty closely, but just looking at her like this in the painting we see a smile and we just think that she is happy which in reality there's more than that being shown. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", they used the system and these were the results,""she's 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry.""

This technolgy proves Mona Lisa's expression, "" 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". Do we know that for sure? That she was feeling that way at that time, it is a painting. The artist could easily make a mistake on her face and give the wrong expression. This technolgy can be right, but the exact percentage of the persons feeling, that person doesn't even know that so how can a computer tell us it?.

"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles"". There are six emotions this technolgy collects thats happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technolgy can be good for our future to tell us some what of the persons expressions, but I domt beleive it will give you the 100 percent truth in things.

Computers aren't smarter then the human poulation itself I mean we created them. It might be smarter then one human, but not at. Someone can move there face and it doesn't have to be an exact expression. Without this technolgy knowing all expressions how is it going to know are right one. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored; bored maybe, but some people don't show expression to those things. To an expert, "" faces dont lie"", but humans lie all the time and yes you can tell by there face most of the time. But people get a way with murder, robbing, stealing, all from lying I mean did they tell form there face there were? No, because nothings 100 percent and I believe nothing can be that powerful to come up with those kinds of calculations.

From the short description of my thinkings, you tell me what you thing? I make these faces all the time, but yet doesn't mean im having the expression on what they make. No body should need a computer to tell what your feeling. Ask that person ? Don't let technolgy make up the world. There trying to find a expressions, movments, and etc. all with computers. Robots are being made from us, are world is changing so fast. When is this going to change ? Soon there going to have robotic figures working in businesses or fast food resturants or resturants period. We are left with what ?",3,7,0.7533506155014038
ebb75d5,"Yes it is valuable to use the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. It's valuable because you will be able to see if they're happy or angry.

The technology is good to use on the students because it can show if they're happyor angry. For example in paragraph 5 sentence 4 you'll be able to read the muscles precisely to convey their emotions. Next, it's a good idea to use on students because what if they're angry and in paragraph 9 it states ""putting on a happy face actually works on a renowned drama coach"". Also using this technology is useful because in paragraph 4 sentence it says you ""facial expressions are universal"" ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" for example not smiling, the technology will pick up on what your emotion really is by weighting the different units.

The use of this technology would be excellent to use on students. To show what their real emotion is. To know if you need to cheer them up or talk to them. Lastly, the use of this facial expression recognizing technology would be useful because it can precisely paint facial muscles to know how you're feeling so you won't have to.

The process begins when the computer puts together a 3-D digital model. There are 44 major muscles in your face that the computer has to detect. Eckman classified six emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He then "" associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles.""

For example the frontalis pars lateralis muscle is above your eye which shows your surpried when it is raised.

Us humans alone can identify facial expressions on peoples faces. If you look at a friend you can tell how they are feeling at that moment. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint the facial muscles percisely on the Mona Lisa painting. Dr. Huangs has new computer software it stores similar info as electronic code. He thinks there could be a different type of code to the painting.

When facial facial expressions a made its about muscular action units. The school computer shouldn't have to know how you are feeling. What kind of problem is that supposed to solve? This idea is nothing but just a distraction for school students. It also may detect wrong facial expressions.

To conclusion computers in school shouldn't detect emotions of the students. I have proved my point on why it shouldn't be in school. I have given you several examples from the passage to prove this point. It shoudn't matter if the computer knows how your feeling.  ",2,7,0.9125344753265381

While some may think that this may not be a helpful system, this could help many others with their studies in school and others just in general to know what they may like or how they are feeling.

This system may not be totally reliable in the beginning of the process but by the time the bugs have been delt with and the researchers have maade sure that the system is precessing to the best of its ability this could potentially become the most helpful system in helping others in school and even outside of their schooling work. ""'A class room computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."" Many may think that this machine could cause problems with teaching but the upside is that this would be able to detect what the student may be strugglung with that the teacher may not know how to handle what they may not be getting.

Every student in school struggles with something that they may have been taught from English, science, to math all of these have at least one student that may have a harder time learning how to solve problems, write essay's, and even make certain reactions happen in science but with this system students may learn faster or at least it would help them learn in a way that they could understand. ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" If this could help students in school with what they are learning and help them understand it better image what could be done with this with a more advanced system.

The better reseachers can make the system the more it will be able to do. This could help disabled people with learning or even make them happier. If the Facial Action Code System can help students in school with understanding certain elements of what is being taught, this could ultimently help disabled kids and even teachers to know the best way to handle what the kids understand and what they don't. The teacher may doing what they can to help diabled children and even adults but these people work slower that normal people do and with this teacher can find out the best way that disabled children or adults can learn.

The Facial Action Coding System may not be valuable to some but this can be extremely valuable to other in schools and maybe even at work. This system can help many people understand what is being taught or even help diability children that may learn a faster way and the teachers may not know that.

ec094aa,"I believe that the Facial Coding System has a valuable future. With the coding system being able to read emotions almost aswell as we humans can, the system may be incorprated into security systems and schools. The Facial Coding System could advice teachers if students are bored or tired as stated in paragraph 6 ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Having a system that could do that would improve the teachers teaching skills for a more fun way of teaching rather than the old monitione lectures. The Facial Coding System can improve the lesson, like an effective human insructor.

If the Facial coding System becomes a valuable System in schoold it could not just improve students educatin but reduce the amounts of absent kids per year. Due to a more enjoyable education kids wouldn't miss out as much as they do. If The Facial Action Codig System is in computers students will more thn likely look up at their screens than their phones. Computers will aslo have to understand that most humans communication is nonverbal as stated by Dr. Huang. This leading to the system needing minor adjustments before a succesful future.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable system and has many possibilities of being used for schools and for various purposes. Not only is the system valuable, it gives others an acknowledgment of how you feel and in how many ways they can help. If you feel upset for any reason anyone could now help by the press of a button.

ec0b21c,"This painting is was made a long time ago. Many people found this painting weird because, back then there wasn't a lot of people happy, also poor. So when you see this picture this girl is happy and looks like she has nice cloths on. People took this picutre into inspiration. And brought a lot to the picture.

In my perceptative I like this idea but then I don't. It is pretty nice that we have a software that can be able to do something like this. it is pretty cool to tell people that we need a picture of you or someone and we will see how happy you are, how mad you are, etc. But I'm really not for it that much. There can be more things we can do instead of doing this. But doing this picture was preety cool.

In paragrpah 5 it states that people can tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on their face. I totally agree with it. If this is your best friend and they are the same to you when you see each other you should smile. But when they don't and still look down then you know there is a problem. Friends are there for each other.

One thing that I argue about this is on paragrpah 6. When you are happy then when a ad pops up then it should be happy. Same way if you were mad then a mad or something down ad will pop up. I don't really agree to this because when people see ads they dont really pay attention to ads. When they see an ad they look at the close button for it and they close it. But if there is an advertisment they of coarse people will have to watch it until the ad is over. I don't like the idea that computers should have computer appresions on what we do.

This article is very good. I like this but of coarse there are some down falls to everything. I like how they did this software on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" becuase this picture inspired other people. But the computer expressions isn't a good idea. They aren't doing this for a good cause. When people have a chance to skip an ad or an advertisment they will. ",2,7,0.4719924330711365
ec0bc1f,"The author describes ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" and how a new technology called the Facial Action Cording System enables compures to identify human emotions. Because the author is trying to tell us how the technology can make us feel differents emotions. In this article we can find too many differents emotions that the Mona Lise had. And how the techonology can do it too.

For example my first evidence that i found in this article is when said that ""Mona Lise is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". So, is trying to tell us that to making Mona Lise smile can be a difficult way, because she had too many differents emotions at the same time,but nothing is impossible. But also the people trying to describe a new technology to identify humans emotion. The new technology is called FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). This is the new technolody that the author wanted to used to find the humans emotions, , and see which one of the two option that they had can be more easy or more faster to find the human emotions.

My other example that also i found in this article is when said that ""according to the new computers softward can recogniza emotion. The softward is the least innovation from Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Backman institute for advanced science at the University Illions."" The author is trying to tell us to describes the new tecnology was little complicated because with he wanted to describe that technology to see if will be more easy to identify the emotions. Also in this article said that the process begings when the computer construct a 3D computer of the face, all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. That why i think that describes that new techology wasn't eassy because the new technology need to identify all about human.

In my conclution is about the computers and how Mona Lise demostration was really intended to bring a smiles to your face, while it show you just how the computers can do. If you smile when a Web ad appears to your screen , a similar somputer could regnize too. Like said Dr. Haunght he predicted that the computer could recognize when a students or another person is becoming confused or sad. And acording to the Facia Feeback theory emotion, moving ourfacaisl muscles can make us feel not only expresss motion, but also can even help us to feel like some differents emotions.

Eckman classified six basic emotions---happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness---and then associated each with characteristics. So in my opnion, this machine can read someones emotion.

This machine uses video imagery in a real face or in a painting, such as ther Mona Lisa. FACS can tell someonme your emotion but your frontalis pars lateralis muscle. This muscle is raised when you're surprise or happy (above your eyes). It can also show if your angry but checking out your orbicularis oris, around your mouth, this gets tighten when you of course, start getting angry. We humanas can calculate our friends emotion by just looking at them, when they are happy, sad, et., but we can't do it to people who we just met so that's why the FACS machine is good.

By just squinting your eyes a little bit and and rassing the sides if your mouth you are smiling. But nayone can smile and be fine. FACS can show if someone is angry or sad or showing onther emotion when us humans can't tell. Just barely raising your eyebrows you can be surprise something happen and no one would know that you are. Or if you're starting to get stress thiis machine could show it help and someone can help you release your stress.

ec9d365,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identfy the many emotions of humans. This was designed to improve the accuracy in perceiving emotions of people around you. This system gives better opportunities for humans and computers to communicate. By moving the muscles in your face, it creates a facial expression, which is then compared to a face that is showing no emotion. This system would be valuable in a classroom because it help teachers relate to students and how they can improve their teaching to make things more fun and understandable, as well as recognizing personal situations.

The Facial Action Coding System helps teachers relate to their students by knowing how they feel about a lesson and how the teacher explains it. The texts states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student it becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor.'"" Knowing how a student feels can help a teacher immensely. This can show what activities and tactics help students most and some things that do not help at all. This could result in the improvement of grades and understanding of what is being taught.

The Facial Action Coding System can also help with the personal life that may be brought into a classroom. If someone is being bullied or is having problems at home, this may be a way for it to be recognized if the person is afraid to say anything. According to the text, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang."" This gives teachers and adults ability to recognize and resolve issues that may not have been known about before.

ecd26ea,"Would it be fun to be able to know what emotion or emotions others are feeling, stictly off of facial muscle movement? Yes, it would be quite interesting to have the ability to have some insight on what other people are thinking and feeling. Although the Facial Action Coding System is a very sharp piece of modern technology, is it truly a valuable invention? Yes, it is impressive and intelligent, but it does not seem to serve a larger purpose within a classroom enviornment. Thus, although the Facial Action Coding System is an impressive piece of modern technology, it is uneeded in a classroom enviornment because it is impractical, unecessary, could potentially be very stressful.

To begin, the Facial Action Coding System is impractical in todays society, especailly within a classroom enviornment. In the text it says that, ""your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" So, in order to place this cutting-edge technology within schools would be a huge financial burden. Most schools only contain practical technology due to a strict, government driven budget. Attempting to fit such a modern piece of technology into the school system would not be practical, and in many cases, it would not be possible either. If the Facial Action Coding System was put into school systems, it could have to possibility to help decode bad mental health in some cases, but it could also cause the government to go even deeper into debt. Thus, because the Facial Action Coding system is predicted to be incredibly expensive, it is not a practical item for a classroom enviornment.

Next, the Facial Action Coding System may be neat, but it is also unecessary. According to the text, it has the capability of showing when ""a smile is not being truthful,"" but lie-detector tests have already been invented for that. The article also states that,""A classroom computer could recognize whne a student is becoming confused or bored,"" yet this is very evident in the body language of a student. Teachers do not need need a software that tells them that their students are not interested in their teaching material because it is shown through their actions. For example, if the student has their head down, is engaging in their own conversation during the lesson, or tends to sleep during class, this portrays to the teacher that they are bored or uninterested. Therefore, because there are already similar inventions and because observance of body language is a very practical tool, it is unecessary to use the Facial Action Coding System within a classroom enviornment.

Lastly, the Facial Action Coding Sytem has the potential of being very stressful to a student. A computer system that is able to publicly expose ones emotions could stir up fear and anxiety that was not within them before. Someone who has is struggling with their mental health does not needed to be reminded of this through their test results, especially while at school. There are plenty of other treatment options for issues like these. The Facial Action Coding System would strip students of emotional privacy, which could potentially stir up stress within a student. Considering that students are already under enough stress with standardized testing, the pressure to perform well in academics and athletics, and to fit in, they do not need an added stress in their life. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding Sytem would do more harm than good and could potentially damage the mental health of the students.

Overall, the concept of a the Facial Action Coding System is very captivating and intriuging, but it does not have many practical uses. It would place a financial burden among the school systems and could potentially stress students even more than they currently are. Thus, the Facial Action Coding Sytem would not be valuable wthin the clasroom setting.    ",5,7,0.8454754948616028

Sometimes, people seem sad or mad but that's just their thinking or worried face.

If the technology of the Facial Action Coding System was that powerful ir smart to read students emotions, it would be good and cool. Teachers would actually know why there student is quiet or why they're not doing anything in class.

When you smile and your cheek bones raise then that a real smile and a showing all your teeth.

Sometimes, when someone is really upset or don't want to be rude they can fake a smile that looks so realist. The software update also could follow is the student is bored or not knowing what to do.

edc0b96,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sytem enables computers to identify human emotions. This use of technolgy could benifit students in a classroom. In a classroom, the Facial Action Coding System could also help the teacher in many ways.

Dr. Paul Eckman has been able to detect six different emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. First a computer will do a 3-D computer model of the persons face, making sure all fourty-four major muscles move like human muscles. Next, a psychologist will look over the face and determine all the emotions. Basically it can be determine how someone is feeling just by their face, even if they are trying to hide emotions.

One way this could benifit in the class room is with the lesson plan. As said in the article, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Some students get embaressed if they do not understand the material, so they will not raise their hand for help. With this technology the teacher would know they are confused and be able help them later on one on one. Also, if a teacher sees that a student is starting to get bored, they could start calling on them more to wake them up, and to keep them focused. If the teacher sees everyone is getting bored, they may change up the learning method they are using to teach them.

Another benifit to the Facial Action Coding System is really knowing how someone feels. Some students have a complicated home life and may need to talk about it, but do not know how. For example, say a student comes in class and acts as if they are fine infront of everyone, but once class starts they always appear to be sad. The teacher may realize this and try to talk to them and figure out what is making them feel this way. By doing this they could make that student day, and even make them feel better about themselves.

On the other hand, I could see why some would say they are against using this kind of technology to read student emtional expressions. For example, what if something goes wrong with the computer and they read the expressions wrong. For that reason some people may not trust what a computer says. Also, some student parents may not want their student to be apart of this technolgy.

edf05ec,"The Facial Action Coding system. It can read almost any face, and tell weither what emotion you have having. You could use this for many diffrent things such as; busting a crimanal, telling if a person around you acully is happy around you, or even if someone is lying to you. But one other important thing this technology can be used for is school.

Lets say you were at school and you were getting bullied or you werent having a good day. You are trying to hide your emotions but your quiet good at it. But the moment you sit down at a computer, it scans your face and it says that you are sad/depressed. The moment the computer reads your face it can alert the teacher and it can tell if the student is enjoying or disliking the class or school in general. Then, when the teacher knows his/her emoiton, he could ask the student why they are feeling this way and if they need to talk. It could make the students feel special and that they dont need to hide there emotions from people and can feel totally comfortable expressing themselves.

Even with that sanificant factor of helping children out with there emotions, there is also some cons about have this system. Facial Action Coding System could almost make the parents a bit worried about there children and be wondering would it could be doing. What if foreigner parties start to hack the system. There could be major problems such as; knowing who you are, having your facial ID, and a chance of getting captured. Some parents are really strict with their children not letting them show there face to a camera just because they are aware of the dangers that could happen.

Another con is that the system could malfunction. Since is sends the information and emotion to teacher/parents the teacher could get worried and ask why this student has this emotion but little do they know that there was wrong information sent. Lets say the student his sitting as his desk and the system scanned his face over a multitude of facial moment and it says your sad, but on the inside you are acually fairly happy. Then the teacher could ask you why he or she is sad, and would try to help him out. But little do they know is that he really happy and something went wrong with the system. It would be pointless, there would be no advantage in having this. It would take time out of your day and there could be a whole ordeal about weither your sad or happy.

But also the Facial Action Coding System could help us find out is is someone has cheated on a test, or is mad at another student. It can prevent many of dangerous thing from happening in the school such as a school shooting for example. If a student was angry 24/7 at school it could aller and worry the teachers that something drastic could happen and a gun could be pulled out. But you can prevent that from happening with the Facial Coding System, you could see that the student is mad all the time and the teachers could reach out and help the student before something drastic happens.

Over all I think it would be a great idea to have a system like this in our schools today because some people are really hurting on the inside, and sometimes us humans can not tell weither if the person is sad, mad, or happy. We could prevent self harm with this! We could stop many of things from happening in our schools today. I think every school should start to incorporate this system into there labtops and computers because it could really help a student out. We could make people the outcasts feel important for once. It would make there day knowing the fact that somone cares about them.

We could help a lot of things we do in school today, it was be a good benefit factor having this system in schools. ",5,7,0.8483452200889587
ee957f3,"Is the Facial Action Coding System Useful in Classrooms?

What if there was a machine capable of not only reconizing, but also understanding feelings via facial expressions? There actually is a machine that could do that. It is called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. This technology could be very useful in classrooms, it could reconize the emotions of the students, it could help identify or even prevent certain situations before they even happen by identifying a problem, and it could help give teachers much needed feedback on the class that they wouldn't verbally recieve.

FACS constructs a 3-D model of the face. It takes into account all 44 maajor facial muscles to determine the feelings or emotions of a person. For example, if you raise your forntalis pars lateralis, or the mucles above your eyes, you are displaying surprise. Using this technology in classrooms could help learn the emotions of students and show how they are feeling.

Identifying emotions in the classroom could be very useful. Students on average sit in classrooms for 6-8 hours a day. Their emotions are still developing and they themselves are still maturing. Sometimes, students may have breakdown or outburst because of various reasons. A student might be stressed out about their grades and begin to preform poorly. Usinng FACS this behavior could be predicted and prevented, letting the teacher know that that student needs a little extra encouragement or more academic assitment. Also, the school enviroment has many variables aside from classrooms alone and that could also cause problems. A student who becomes angry at their classmates has the possibilty of putting them in trouble, It coould either lead to a fight, confrontation, bullying, an other things. Yet, if the problem could be determined becore it could even start, it could help defuse or prevent the situation from escalating resulting in a safer learning enviroment. Considering this FACS could become a very useful additions to the schools as a community.

FACS could not only help the school as a whole, but more specifically, it could help the teachers. Dr. Huang claimes that, "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Using this statement we can recognize that not all information and feedback is being recieved by neither student nor teacher. A teacher's job is to help educate and prepare their students for the future. However, that becomes difficult when a single teacher has to take responsibilty of a large ammount of students. Some students express their concerns and questions but others choose to remain silent. Using FACS a teacher could now determine which students are confused and worried and which students are doing fine. By using this information a teacher could offer additional help for a student that a student wouldn't normally ask for. Knowing where to focus on and which students need help could help a teacher tremendously. It would facilitate a teacher's job and help them teach with greater efficientcy.

Facs would recognize student's emotions, help identify and prevent certain situations before they occur, and it would give teachers feedback on the class that they wouldn't recieve otherwise. FACS would help education by targeting students that are well of and students that need additional help instead of having a teacher assume the whole class is confused or content. FACS is an innovative piece of technoly that could bring forth a new age of education if placed in schools.",5,7,0.8631590008735657
ee9b83d,"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuble because teachers and other students can tell how a student may feel. It is important to know how someone is feeling so they can get counciling if needed, or so they can cheer up others. It's also important to be able to recognize facial expressions and the different types of muscle movements. This new type of technology can also be used to improve school systems. The Facial Action Coding System is of value to use on reading students' emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System can regonize how a student may be feeling. This could be beneficial for teachers and councilors because then they could help the student with any emotional problems they may be having. The technology, ""can even identify mixed emotions"". Mixed emotions can show a mix of happiness and sadness at the same time because people's emotions aren't always clear, and people can appear as something they are not. Facial expressions for each and every emotion are diverse.

Recognizing facial expressions and different muscle movements can help determine how someone is feeling. Instead of, ""we humans perform(ing) this same impressive ""calculation"""", we humans can use a more reliable source. The Facial Action Coding System can, ""handle the complex algorithms used to decode"". It can, ""indicate the difference between a geniune smile and a forced one."" Having this in a classroom can tell what students are actually feeling, and we humans wouldn't have to be forced to guess.

This type of technology can improve how schools work. If, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", then a teacher or staff member can better help that student or excite the class. Or, ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". The learning process can be made more entertaining and enriching to students.

Having technology to read students' emotional expressions in school is vauble. It can determine if a student has mixed emotions and needs a councilor, it can calculate how a student honestly feels, and it can improve school systems by giving more attention to those who are troubled or bored. This technological system can be beneficial and vauble. ",4,7,0.8949695825576782

""New computer software that can recognize emotions"", some may view it as an invasion of privacy, or just straight up weird. I believe it could be a new way to not only help but to recognize your own feelings or your persona to others.

As we speak about the new invention I'd like to mention how it works. ""the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"", there are 44 major muscles in the model that move like a human muscle for accuracy. Someone who is not only an expert with technology works on these but also someone who is an expert in mood, stability, etc works through these. ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman.""

""There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness......"" These emotions are ""calculated"" per say by looks, movements, and the facial muscles.

eefd389,"That ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a Joke

We all know that there are different emotions going are the school. The different types of emotions that are commonly at a school are happy, mad, sad, bored, or even nuetral. My question is, why do you care how the student is feeling? I know that the teacher himself or herself does not want to be here so, what makes them think that us students wants to be here.

A student comes in the school the teacher says, ""Goodmorning!"" The student just walks past without saying anything. Let me take a guess, the student is not feeling school, sleepy, or even that student might not like the teacher. We do not need a ""Facial Action Coding System"" pulled out to just find out the students feeling.

In paragraph eight, it states, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" A person lied, why can the investigator not do the job how it is suppose to be done taking everything step by step intead of getting a machine to do all of the job.

ef04816,"The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is a waste of time. I think it's a waste of time because studies show that you can be able to tell when someone is down. Not by the face but by their actions. You will start to see a change in them, they wont act the same even if they try so hard to,ect. The Facial Action Coding System is a waste of money, time, and space.

Why do all this just to see if someone is hiding their emotions, when you can just observe them. A true friend, mother, father ect; will know if something is wrong with their loved ones. In the article the very first sentence says "" she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Why does it matter how fearful,disgusted,or angry she is if it clearly states she happy 83 percent. We are not computers, robots or none of that we are human beings and we all have different emotions running at the same time. Thats what makes us, us!

In the article it also states "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" My point here is that you dont observe a persons feelings by looking at their face. You observe the way they act and compare it to how they usually act when mad, sad, or happy, ect. People sometimes hide their emotions by putting on a fake smile, hiding their true emotions thats why you observe actions.

I just feel as if its easy to tell the difference between different emotions. It's common sense to me, but it may not be to you. When you really think about it, they make it seem like its really complicated. But if you would just pay close attention to your loved ones, and stop thinking that everyone has to always be happy. Then you will see that its easy to tell the difference of each emotion we humans have.

This is why i think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Hopefully you will understand where i'm coming from. The Facial Action Coding System is unnessacary, and a waste of time. It's easy to tell when someone is acting strange or different. All you have to do is observe.   ",3,7,0.8297966122627258
ef27076,"While there are benifits for facial scanning to understand ones true intentions, does not justify the scuitiny thats subject to follow. Some students get in touble for yawning during a class. Imagine a teacher realizing half of their class has an above 70% rating of disgust in thir class. What would that do psycologically. Giviing the ability to understand what people truly feel provides complications for human relationships in the future.

The ability to know what everyones thinking is a blessing and a curse. Yes it would be nice to be able to read every situation and adapt so one becomes near perfect. But thats not what its about. As a society based around lies, some small and innocent and some huge and incrimanating, the loss of that ability to hide our true feelings so that we save anothers from being hurt. Say the technology comes out for phones and Sallys neice came in wanting to know what Sally thinks about when looking at her. The results could be catostropic, they can tear relationships up in an instant. All because of not being able to tell that white lie, ""Oh your hair looks good Rachel"", ""Yeah I dlove to hang out with you!"" , ""No i dont find you annoying"". In an age that is supposed to be social with the inventions of smart phones and apps like instagram where one can talk to someone 2000 miles away in seconds,, has hurt us more than helped.

The connection face to face has slipped through the cracks. People are scared to talk to others in person or on the phone.

ef3ba7e,"She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Wait, anger and disgust is rising? Happiness is plummeting? What is happening? The answer is that this emotion reading technology, though interesting, could actually have a very negative effect on the people it is used on. Especially in a class room, one of the most influential places on a childs life. Sure, it is cool being able to read Mona Lisa's emotions, but on real students a facial action coding system would be impractical, invasive, and damaging.

Being able to detect other peoples emotions is a scary idea, but even before diving into the effects it could have on the mind, it's physical restraints are just as daunting. In paragraph seven, the article states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Schools are already struggling to keep up with the cost of electronics for thousands of students, and having to get new laptops or computers to implemenet this technology would be extremely expensive and unwise. Especially when many schools have real problems that need to be addressed such as a larger special needs program, or more funding to the band who hasn't gotten new uniforms in twenty years. Then once all this money is invested, what if it does not work. This technology is clearly just starting to develop, and it runs solely on facial muscles. The article tells you how to raise your cheek muscles to show a real smile, surely students would find ways to exploit this and fake emotions, rendering the technology ineffective. Most importantly, schools are a fast paced environment, adding this technology and teaching the students how to use it would waste a lot of time that could have been devoted to learning. The other option would be to implement it and not tell them at all, but that would be a clear invasion of privacy and could get the school in legal and financial trouble.

All of this is assuming the school would even want the technology. It sounds very nifty at a glance, but the idea itself is actually extrememly invasive. Emotions are the secret to what's going on in our brain, all of our deepest thoughts and desires are secretly expressed in our emotions, sometimes very subtley. Kids are very secretive, and would almost certainly not take kindly to having there personal emotions, and by extension, what they are thinking about, out in the open. The author says that this technology in a class room would help recognize when a student becomes ""confused or bored,"" but what about all the other emotions that would come with it: the sadness over a lost loved one, the love a teen is feeling towards their crush. These emotions are deeply personal, and if a child wanted to share them he would tell you. Stealing them away with technology is a clear invasion of privacy.

This type of invasion isn't just unkind, it could, instead of helping, actually damage a students emotional or mental well being. Emotions can be a rollercoaster. Everyone has their own way of handling them , and for some people getting them intensly analyzed is not the answer. In fact, this type of prying could cause students to retract into themself, and lower self confidence. For example, if a teen is always being reminded he is feeling sad, won't that just further his sadness? Then, if students don't want to share their emotions, they may start using their facial muscles to trick the machine into thinking they are feeling a certain way. One of the number one things all psychologists will tell their patients in dealing with emotions is not to cover them up and hide them behind other emotions. Constantly being in a state of hiding with emotions could cause students to snap in a bad way.

The last thing students of any age need is more problems to worry about. Emotions are a large, personal part of anyone's life, and to try and analyze them in a classroom setting would be impractical, invasive, and damaging.",6,7,0.8033522367477417
ef49472,"Would you want a software to track your emotions? Facial Action Coding System is now enabling a computer to identify human emotions. This would allow your computer to read students emotions by weighting the different units to identify mixed emotions. As proven by Dr. Huang who studied human anatomy using the muscles to precisely convey emotions, I think this is a great idea.

First, by using Facial Action Coding System this will allow teachers and staff to know how a student is feeling during a test, or assignment. If a teacher knows how someone feels when taking an assignment they might go easier on the student in class, and give them extra chances to do the assignment at another time. Teachers don't always know what a student is going through. Every student is prepared to be ready for a test in a certain way. Some students often take a longer time than others. The recognition of a facial espression could easily tell a teacher how they were feeling about it all along.

Secondly, most students go through a lot at home, or even in school. Many students are diagnosed with many mental stabilities such as ADHD, ADD, anxiety, and so on. The guidance administration can help a student who has these mental stabilities by seeing how they feel while they do assignments, and tests. Seeing how a student feels would give them the chance to get help, and have them seperated from the room to help them focus on certain things. Not all students will come out about how they feel; Some keep to themselves and don't want to talk about there problems.

Finally, a computer seeing how you feel could make your day better. If your computer sees that you are sad it might put up a funny ad to make you laugh. If your computer sees that you are angry it might put up a calming, or soothing ad. If your computer sees that you are faking a smile it might put up something that will make you turn your fake smile into something real. Like Dr. Huang stated "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too.""

In conclusion, the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions is a good idea. This will allow students to have a better shot on there assignment, or test in school. Usuing this will often give students more of a reason to smile, and feel more comfortable.",4,7,0.7873623371124268

f02ce6a,"Ever have a happy feeling where you can't stop smiling or felt that dearth of happiness to where you may possibly cry? Those are part of your emotions, something every human being has. Dr. Paul Eckman has created valuable technology to help show a persons emotions. Dr. Huang helps us reveal much of the sciene of emotions.

Your face is fraught with 44 different major muscles. These muscles move around in various ways to show emotion as well as other activities used by you face. These muscles have been programed into a 3-D computer based program also known as FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to help scientist show someone's different emotions. Dr. Paul Echman, the creator of FACS, has classified the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with charecteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, when you raise your eyebrows, you use the frontalis pars lateralis muscle showing that you're surprised. You use your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) to tighten your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang,""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" One example of this is not smiling as broadly. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks facial moventens. How can this be benifital to teacher and in everyday classroom studies? Teachers can use this to tell how a student my feel emotionally. If the students are feeling happy, showed by FACS, the teacher can teach in her ways through that happiness; however, is the students are feeling upset and sad the teacher can specify her way through that emotion to teach through it and still allow the stuents to aquire the knowledge, or she can do an activity to brighten their attitudes.

The Mona Lisa demostration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr, Huang predicts. ""Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" How effective could that be to a classroom? Teachers never want to have the student evironment negative to teach in. Personally, the brighter the room, mentally and physically, the more a student like me can soak in the knowledge given to me on

a day to day basis. Some of my classes that are more positive help me to learn.

Making and moving your face to show of different emotions can actually make you feel that certain way. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. A reowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. In the classroom a teacher may have his or her students make different emotions to help their students feel that way during class. In the beginning of class a teacher may use a homogram of someone smiling and having the students repeat its ways to positively improve the emotions of the students during class.

Technology has its values of reading, understanding, and improving emotions that can be expressed by students in a classroom. School may not be as boring with the technology like this at hand. If we have the resources to make the world of school better, why not use it? ",4,7,0.7644177675247192

According to Professor Huang and Professor Sebe, a computer would be able to identify if someone is faking a smile or is geniunely happy in their life. A computer that can recognize facial expressions can greatly help people by showing if they are unhappy or depressed, and show advertisements that people are interested in.

Faking a smile can mean multiple emotions are present. If someone is faking a smile, then that person could be depressed. In paragraph eight, ""in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways ... using a different muscle."" Computers and facial experts can tell if someone is unhappy by examining the subject's face and deciding whether they used their zygomatic major and the risorius muscle to smile. The subject's life is affected by an expert or computer telling the person that they are unhappy, which can lead to the person getting help. Achieving better health could all be from the idea that a computer is able to tell if someone is unhappy and a result of that is the person seeking help. In paragraph nine, ""moving [one's] facial muscles not only exresses emotions, but may also even help produce them."" Computers can recognize if someone is making a facial expression and that works by making emotions for the person to feel any type of feeling. Because of computers recognizing what a person is feeling, computers should be able to communicate with a person and express to that person what they are feeling or experiencing.

Advertisements also help show emotions. In paragraph six, smiling when a Web ad appears, might make ""a similar ad ... follow."" Computers can tell if someone is enjoying the advertisements and might add another similar ad that could be enjoyable for that person again. Advertisements can add to the health of a person by allowing that person to experience happiness and adding another ad to the web is just increasing their health. However it is different for a person in a workplace or classroom, according to paragraph six, such as a classroom computer can ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Boring ads can decrease a persons health by making that person have less motivation to do their job or work. Advertisements have an effect on people's health in which so adds to why computers should be able to communicate with people about their feelings.

Computers should be able to communicate with people about their feelings, because it can help people greatly in the aftermath. Computers can help by discovering if the person is unhappy in life or can increase their health by allowing that person to experience a happy moment. A person who discovers that they are depressed from a computer that tells them, can expect so much. A person can expect to achieve happiness by seeking help. Computers also increase a persons happiness level from the advertisements that pop up on a computer.

The first reason why I am against it is that I don't see any value in it. Why would people want to know what there emotional expression is when they are the ones who are doing the expression. The other person might want to know but at the same time maybe they're okay with what they are seeing from the other person than finding out what is behind it that expression. To me that's like invading my personal emotions, and then when they find out it means something else they might be mad or asking questions why.

The next reason is, that there might be a possibility that the machine is incorrect. For example, when the person is acting like he/she is mad but messing around, but the machine might take it serious and the person who doesn't know if he/she is actually mad will think that is and start asking questions why are they mad at them and then it create an argument between them. There also could be a malfunction in the system and when the person is actually happy the machine might take it as a sad and fearful expression and that will raise some questions.

The last reason why I am against it is what is there to learn from the machine? The only thing I see it as a helping thing is when it comes to court and therapy setions. The only thing I can see it as is a machine that causes violence and arguments. There is absolutely nothing else you can learn from it and to me its useless.

f0b3065,"Nowadays, technology is becoming very advanced. It seems to become more advanced every day, and now we are at the point where computers can detect emtoions through facial expressions. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a system that can recognize human emotion based on how much all 44 major muscles in your face move. This technology has many uses. When you smile at a certain Web ad, a similar ad might follow, and when you frown at a certain ad, the next ad might be different. Also, this technology can make video faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. One very important use of this technology is in our school system. Using this technology in our school systems would be very beneficial because it could help students better understand lessons.

Education is becoming more technology based. Many lessons are being placed on the internet for students to read, students are typing essays and completing online assignments and then sending them to their teacher by email, and students even take the ISTEP on the computer instead of by hand. This facial coding technology can help students in an age where it is easy to get lost in the vast amount of resources that are on the Web. Paragraph 6 of the article states that if a student becomes bored or confused during a lesson, then the computer will notice that the lesson is not beneficial to the student, and it will change the lesson like an effective human instructor. This would be very helpful because it would make sure that the student is enjoying and most importantly understanding the lesson. The student would see an increase in test scores and grades, and would be more likely to remember the concepts of the lesson because the lesson was enjoyable. Students will get a lot more out of their education if this technology is implemented into the classroom.

Overall, this new facial coding technology has many benefits. One of the most important benefits is in our education system. If computers could recognize a student's facial expression, it could help the student fully understand the lesson which would lead to an increase in test scores. With the world of technology constantly advancing, students need something that can help them with their education. Instead of browsing through web pages and desperately searching for anything that could help them understand a lesson, computers could alter the lessons and make it easier to understand. This new technology is very beneficial to students, and is vital if education continues to be more technology-based.",4,7,0.8556818962097168

For example in parapgragh three , the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles (movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit""). Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding Systems) has classified six basic emotions- such as happiness, surprise, anger disgust, fear and sadness; each associates each with a characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Facial expressions are universal and transitional as such the smallest of the facial movement or the mood you choose can depic the varying degrees of expression. Using video imagery, the new emotion- recongnition software travks these facial movements- in a real face or even in a picture (such as Mona Lisa).

The software would help people understand facial expressions better to be more perpared on an emotional scale on what to do if that particular person is upset. In fact, we humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day. Each expression is compared to a nuetral face ( showing no emotion). For instance, you could probably tell if your friend is having a bad day or good day just by the facial expression she/or he portrays. Dr. Huang; his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as a electronic code.

Based on the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions , but also may even produce them. Study shows if you smile you release endorphines that'll actually make you happy!

One is because the kids might not want you to know how they feel. My second one is becuase what if a kid gets picked to be mad or sad and he gets into a fit and he gets super ticked off becuase he didn't want anyone to know. The last one is becuase that weird to be checking for the kids emotions. The first two are both similar and the third one is just plain obvious.

Yes it might work in classes like drama club, Happy day club or other clubs but other than that i dont think sobecuasei in just a regular classroom it would be weird as i say. I beleive it could also maybe work for sports but other than that i dont agree that we should have thoese emotion reader system in our classrooms. people might not want to get recognized as mad,sad,happy or even just plain or tired.

Another last reason why i dont beiieve it should be in the classrooms because just as i said in the other paragraph that peoplemight notlike it or might now want people to know how they feel becuase it might be personal. It is personal and its crossing the line. Soem people might get into a fit and that wont look pretty.

In conclution,i disagree that we should put the Facial Action Coding System in the classrooms because it wouldn't look good in the classrooms for students nor parents.            ",2,7,0.7808929681777954

This could be good because the teacher might be willing to make up new and improved lessons intsead of the same boring old thing.

The reason I am against the Facial Action Coding System is becuase not everyone should be able to know what I am feeling. My facial expressions might show that I am upset over something so drastic but, its really i didn't get any pasta for dinner last night. Your expressions can read into to much. Then what, what are you suppose to when you find out everyone in your class either bored or upset you cant talk to everyone about their emotions not most people would want to open up, Which is understandable because you didnt come to school to have your teacher read your facial expression and start to anaylze everything about you.

First of all, if technology at school would be able to do that the students would be more efficients in class. This technology allow the computer to scan how the student is feeling so this technology can help a lot because many students doens not pay attention cause they are not interested in the class or subject and here is where Facial Action Coding come in.

All of this information was founded from the new Facial Action Coding System, a new software that can actually calculate accurate emotional expressions.

Young adults could be facing something serious in their life but may not have the right words to express how they feel. Finding help for those feeling down is difficult. Using this technology could help those in need. This technology can help with identifying if a student is happy or worried, being able to have fun and put a smile on a students face while using this technology, and being able to identify if a student is confused or bored.

The Facial Action Coding System can help with students and their emotions. ""Of course, most students would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" (5). Not everyone can tell what an individual is feeling. The help of this technology can help those who need it most. It can help detect if a student is happy or worried, but it can also put a smile on someones face.

Using this technology can help put a smile on your face in many ways. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face."" (6). A lot of technology used today can put a smile on someone's face. Video games, social media, etc. Using the Facial Action Coding System is beneficial in many ways as well. It can help with being productive, getting help for a student who might need it. Technology can help with putting a smile on a students face, but it can also help with identifying if a student is confused or bored.

Technology can help identify if a student is confused or bored and could also help them for later in the future. ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" (6). Being able to identify a students emotions in a school could possibly help the student with getting better grades, feeling better about themselves, and passing each day with positivity.

f2e3cfb,"What would you think if technology was made that could tell every emotion someone has, at any time of day? Well, pretty soon you may know first-hand, as our current technology is actually well underway to reaching that level. As of right now, a new software has been developed that can percieve emotions in others faces, using several different variables. It is known as the Facial Action Coding System, and judge six different emotions. The question is, how does such a machine work, and how can we know if this machine holds any value in a classroom setting?

Before taking a further look at whether such an ability is needed in classrooms, it is imperative to first understand just how the Facial Action Coding System works. It starts by analyzing the face and constructing a 3-D model of it, so that the 44 major muscles in the face can be easily captured. Then, the system labels slight muscle movements -known as action units- in the face and uses those to calculate emotions. As of right now, there are six classified emotions to compare the facial muscle movements to: Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The question is, how does this machine gather muscle movements as a certain type of emotion? How that works is the human body has similar facial expressions for certain moods, such as raising eyebrows when surprised. These are automatic in just about everybody, making it way easier to gather emotions. If someone were to, for example, tighten their lips, near everyone could understand the possible tension and anger from the person. Thanks to the easy understanding of facial patterns, the machine can too!

The science of facial mucle patterns may not be completely understoood, but there currently are ideas that maybe making certain faces can change your mood! According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only displays emotions, but it may help produce them as well! This is due to the empathy that may occur when imitating someone's facial patterns, even if one is unaware they are. With this information, we can understand the complexity of human emotion a little better, and possibly gather a conclusion from all of this that goes for this technology in schools. The question is, just what have we gathered and understood so far?

In conclusion, there were several take-aways from this article. For starters, the machine can evaluate six emotions, which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It does this via the understanding of the human facial muscles and the different ways we physically convey emotion. And not only that, but when someone may be only appearing as an emotion/set of emotions, they can subconsciously mold into that emotion. From all of this, only one sound conclusion can be made. The use of this technology is valuable in classrooms, as well as outside of school, due to the fact that it helps to recognize facial emotions in students and teachers alike so that they are more aware of their surroundings.",3,7,0.8623498678207397
f305dac,"Facial Coding: Valuable or Not

There is a new emotion reader out there, called FACS, short for the Facial Action Coding System. This new application has a bunch of cool features and innovations that can have some pretty practical applications. However, this essay is only focused on one application; is this system beneficial for reading human emotions in a classroom setting? People have mixed feelings about this, but this essay will focus on why this new FACS is not extremely valuable for reading emotional expressions in a classroom setting.

First, what can this new emotion reader do? Well, this thing can read all of the emotions on the face of the Mona Lisa. Not just one or two, but four emotions at once, and balance the percentages for each emotion, to let you know exactly how much of each emotion the person is feeling. This could have some really cool applications, like being able to tell what emotions someone was trying to convey in a drawing, or being able to tell what kinds of things you like or dislike, based off your expressions when you are shown different advertisements. There is so much you can do with this new technology, and there is a lot of uses that it has. However, the things you can do in a school setting are just mediocre.

There is a lot that sounds like cool things you can use this application for in school. In the text it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" The text also says,""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This sounds like a really good thing. However, instead of a computer system having to recognize when a student gets confused or bored, the student can just speak up and say something about it. That is not all, though. The computer system could either, one, misread a student's expression and make the lesson harder to understand or take a lot longer, or two, the student might just start drifting away and thinking about something else that is really confusing, like Einstein's theory of relativity. The computer, in turn, would make the lesson modified when it doesn't need to be, and have so many modifications that the student gets completely lost and doesn't understand anything that is happening in the lesson, just because he or she started to think about something else for a couple of seconds.

Lastly, this facial recognition system could seem like a pretty big invasion of privacy. Do people want everyone to know every single emotion they ever feel? Do they want all their teachers to know that they find what they are talking about boring? No, they do not, at least for the most part. Systems like these are getting pretty close to almost being able to know what someone is thinking, and most people don't want everyone to know what they are thinking about. The text says, ""The new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" This text says that the system can detect your emotions, but also your mixed emotions. Going back to the Mona Lisa example, the software can track the exact amount of emotions that you have, and the percentages of the emotions that you are feeling. This seems way too much like an invasion of privacy, given that people are giving what their feeling, and all of it too, away to a computer system, that can be tracked or looked at by anyone. Now maybe the system will only give what you are feeling to a teacher, or maybe it will not even do that, and function as a one-on-one learning guide. Even still, their are various ways to get into computer and technological programs, and forcing kids to give away all their emotions just for a possible improved and modified lesson seems like way too much to force someone to do, for that amount of a reward.

So, the FACS could have numerous practical applications for entertainment purposes and other purposes too. However, putting it at use to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom isn't one of them. In conclusion, the use of FACS in a classroom isn't worth the value that comes out of it, as it could have better applications elsewhere, it could glitch out or misread emotions, it could read emotions that the student is feeling about something else rather than the classroom, and finally, an appliclation that can read all of your expressions and convey them to other people is a pretty huge invasion of privacy, and forcing people to use this program is not worth the value of a slightly modified lesson for each individual. In the end, FACS is more useful as an entertainment device rather than having a school setting application. This technolgy has great value in so many areas, but schooling just isn't one of them.",6,7,0.838529109954834

This tells me that teachers can know if a student does not want to work or is honestly confused while the teacher can provide more help for the student and can make the subject more fun or interesting without the student letting the teacher know. Another reason according to the text is "" Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This shows me they can paint facial muscles so they can have enough to know specific emotions to one another.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, "" notes Dr. Huang.""

The Facial Coding System is a 3-D computer model of the face. Eckmen, the creator of the Facing Coding System, classifies six basic emotions including, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. Then, he associates them with characterisric movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degress of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). The new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can even identify mixed emotions.

This helps to know how students are feeling.                  ",2,7,0.9193134903907776

In the beginning of the the introduction say, ""New sofware has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others."" I say this because techology can make mistskes such as a computer that can read your emotions through your face and can have an accurate result. For example you might think an person who is happy by showing a smile but is the person really happy behind that smile with hidden emotions. It's not only one person there are others too who hide their emotions.

In paragraph 5 says, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actuallly describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convry specific emotions."" I can somewhat agree because he is right about the fact that it's hard describing a facial expreesion that includes surprised or sad.

This shows that we dont need this type technology to show other people how we feel if they accurate.",3,7,0.9023848176002502
f3f84e5,"In humans it is hard to detect how someone is feeling, especially when they are doing their best to hide it. What if there was a way to know how your friend or student was feeling emotionally. Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to help detect these emotions and could definitely help in the classroom. Having a computer recognize facial movements could greatly increase the way teachers are teaching their students.

The FACS was created by Dr. Paul Eckman who classified six basic emotions for a computer designed to contruct ""a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" These basic emotions are happiness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise, and sadness. These are all found by the characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, when raising your eyebrows it sends a signal that you are surprised. When you are angry your lips tighten. This could all very well be detected while in the classroom.

In the classroom teachers normally don't know how a student is feeling. Using FACS could help improve with knowing their emotions. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could help change the students lessons for the better.

FACS is valuable in the classroom to read the emotional expressions of the students. ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements - in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" This computer can do more than just calculate the basic six emotions, it can even identify mixed emotions. Most kids in the clasroom I'm sure have mixed emotions. It could be about an upcoming test that they are scared to take but are also partially happy to have it over with. With FACS they could know exactly how the student is feeling. According to the article, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This helps show what has changed and what the person is feeling.

The FACS could improve ways for humans and computers to communicate in the classroom. They can detect how the student is feeling on a test, the math homeowork given, or the lesson being taught in class that day. This system can help detect the six basic emotions and mixed emotions. The emotions calculated can act as a human instructor and modify lessons. Knowing that ""most human communication is nonverbal"" would definitely come to use in a classroom of students with different emotions. This is why the FACS is valuable and should be used in a classroom. ",4,7,0.8935943245887756

They said, her face was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 2 percent angry. I dont know they are to come up with these percentages.

I feel like this technology can come into good use, although, i just dont really see the importants of it. In cases like this one, with Mona Lisa, yes i feel as if it was a great thing, but i just dont see any other good uses for it. I would really like to find out another use for this technology to be able to think it is very useful.

I do think this technology is very interesting. I like how it broke up Mona Lisas face into three different emotions. I think that is very cool. I dont see any other use for the technology, but if it is just used for paintings, i think it could be kinda useful. I would like to see the technology in action more to see what all it can do. I want to see it figure out peoples emotions by the look on their face. I hope to see more of this technology in the future. I would also like to know who the inventors of this technology are.

f40b5d8,"Trying to detect someones emotions is like playing the game ""Clue"", it's a mystery and very hard to figure out. But what if there was a software that allowed a chance to put the individual infront of a camera and the thought of guessing was no longer an option, because all the answers are sitting on the screen? Professor Thomas Huang from Beckman Institute has created such a software, a software that has the ability to calculate someone's emotions much like in math class. This new software can open doors for the future, and give us new advancements in the classroom, but could it be an end to simply asking if some is okay? Could this be the end to emotional privacy, or simply emotions?

The new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has many promising attributes and the ability to open new doors for technology and learning environements in the future. It being able to calculate emotions as easily as math problems, could help us decode a lot of the mystery that is the human mind. The process starts wiht a 3-D computer model of the face, and contains information of all the 44 major muscles in a human face and with the help of psychologists, it can classify six emotions and associate them with movements of facial muscles. This type of technology has the ability to be used in a classroom to watch when a student is getting bored or tired to help the teacher better themselves when teaching. Or maybe even help in real world situations when someone goes in front of a jury, or even during interviews for a job. But how accurate is this new software, and how do we know we can rely on it?

The Facial Action Coding System is seemly flawless with many positive outlooks on what is instore for us in the futrue, but has two big questions sitting on its shoulders. How can we rely on this system? And how do we know that this is even an accurate reading? When thinking about someones emotions, one thinks of the individuals emotions as diverse and extremely different from everyone elses. So how can this software accurately read individual emotions around the world? Dr. Huang says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"", he firmly believes that his new software can identify the most mixed emotions with the use of video imagery and emotion recognition. This however, still does not provide us with a good example of how we can be sure that this is a reliable way to read someones emotions and could potetially ruin human socialization and emotions toward one another.

While this new software may seem like the ""next big thing"", there are many ways that this could potentially ruin the human race. Society right now is circling around the phone, it is how we communicate, have a social life, and figure things out. It is in our way of life and we have adapted to the idea of constantly having a phone at our beck and call. So why not add in another way of relying on technology, but this one can help us figure out someones emotions, since simply asking ""Are you okay?"" is too hard and time consuming. Why not just stick them in front of a camera to have it tell them how they are feeling instead of trying to listen to how they feel and talking with one another. This new Facial Action Coding System has the ability to open many new doors, but it could close the door for human socialization.

The Facial Action Coding System is an advancement in technology and has the abilities to open and grow our future. It had the ability to help out in classroom environments and give more support during other real life situations. But with it can come the destruction of human socialization and emotions and make a total mess of how we interact with each other. While trying to figure out someones emotions is very difficult and challenging, it may be better to stick with such ways rather than completly giving up what makes us human and causing a catastrophe in the human world.

It could even help show if the majority of a class is having trouble with something so the lesson or subject at hand can be further explained.

Another way facial coding in classrooms could be quite helpful is for students with special needs.

The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscle in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscle is called an ""action unit"". Dr. Eckman, creator of FACS, has classified six basic emotions: happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

However, my claim is that FACS technology shouldn't be used on people. Some people might want to keep some of their emotions to themselves. Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy. For example, when talking about someone or a movie, some people don't want others to know how you really feel because it might hurt their feelings. You wouldn't someone saying they like your new haircut, when the FACS says they felt disgust when they saw your shirt. Peoples' emotions should be kept to themselves.

In comparison, others might say FACS technology should be used on people. You would be able to find the truth on how someone actually feels about something. In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscule, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie. For example, when a dictator says he treats his citizens fairly, we can use the FACS technology to find out how he really treats them, or to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.

In conclusion, FACS technology can go both ways. It can be bad by revealing sensitve emotions that no one wouldn't want to be seen or heard. On the other hand, it can be used to catch deceiving individuals. Either way this technology can be a blessing or a curse. But in the it depends on who is using it and what their intentions are.",3,7,0.8182024359703064

""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" We all try to hide our emotions, but there are people that could help us. Like friends or family they might make you smile when you're feeling down.

Everyone has feelings and we sometimes express it to people we get along. The Facial Action Coding Sysytem is not going to make us smile everyday, we all go through something in life. ""For example, it you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" People are not going to express their feelings on every ad that tells you how you feel. These technology of calculating your emotions are not going to be helpful.

In conclusion, the technology that calculates your emotions are not going to work. Maybe Mona Lisa had so many emotions that poeple used that technology to fake her facial expression.

This new technology is a valuable tool for teachers, and should be in use to understand a student better, and truly know what he or she is feeling.

The facial coding system is computer automated, and has six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Yes technology messes up a lot of times, maybe the emotions the computer has given about a person is not actually what they are feeling. There is also the possibility this coding system does not have enough emotions to express or show a persons true emotion. The author states the Mona LIsa was ""83 percent happy"" (paragraph 1 sentence 1). What if she was actually 83 sad, angry or annoyed.

Even though there are these possiblities of mistake as the author said in paragraph 5, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday"" (sentence 1-2). Humans perform the same facial coding system everyday in trying to read how friends or family are feeling. Who says humans do not also mess up in reading a perons emotions the wrong way. No matter the possible mistakes that can happen if a facial coding system can help a teacher reach out to a student in need just off emotions a computer gives them it is valuable.

The Facial Action Coding System is a valuable necessity for a teacher or counselor to have. It can prove to help a student in need even when they are shying away from calling for help. This coding system can give people more insight on the mind and emotions of the people around them, and could possibly stop tragedy from occuring.

like it would solve lots of things like if there was a murder going on the detectives could try to feel how the person there are doing the interview is feeling to see if he is nervous confused or not or if someone who is thinking about comitting suecide

is they depressed. It can and could save lots of lives if we could feel the emotion of another person like u really cant tell if a person is lying to u only if they are making it look like they are lying so many people have beeen incient in crimes they didnt do.like that would solve lots of things save lives

and lots of other things.

Here are some reasons why it would be a bad idea if we could feel the emotion and the feeling of another person like some people wouldnt feel comtable with they some people like to keep to there self and like to not show how they feeling like the person could have a big smile on there face but really feeling like they want to end it all.Also some people would take that for avantage like some people would amake fun of u and bully u and now thwy can think nd feel how u feel like they never really never gonna stop because they know they hurting u and they doing there job to hurt u but it wouldalso be bad because like there could be people around u that dont even know u trying to see how u feel and stalk u.

This is how i feel about it i like both of the facts but they both have turn offs and turn ons like its my opinion im not stating facts that what it is really doing but some people would agree with me and some people wouldnt like we all have a diffrent mind set these are what i think of but i mostly like the reason why because like there no reason why we should invade someones privaciy just to see how they feel like i said some people like to stay to there self.That would make lots of people fear for there life because theres weird snd sick people out here now that knows what u feeling and would harm u but thats just a bad idea to see how others are feeling like i said its my opinion many would agree and many would disagrree.",3,7,0.42834144830703735

f53b37e,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author is decribing how a new technology: the Facial Action Coding System, is enabling computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology: to read the emotional expressions of students, is not valuable. Even though human have simaliar muscles to show the same emotion each one does vary a great significance.

In paragraph 6 of the article Dr. Huang made a bold prediction ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" This means to him that a students emotions can be completly read by a computer scan. This doesn't seem logical in any means at all. Have you ever watched your classmates facial expression change from confused to them understanding completely in the blink of an eye? Im sure you have. If a computer reads your confused facial emotion in the middle of a lesson right before you understand it, it will change making you have to reset your brain to relearn what you were the the bridge of mastering.

In paragraph 5 a sentence contradicted the article ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait,"" if this is true then why would an artifical intelegence be able to read emotions better than a human who experiences the similar emotions? A real life example is when someone is really good at looking like they don't care. This is a hard face to read because some people just naturally have it at all times. With a piece of simple technology how would the scan be able to look past the same face with the same emotion at all times? It most likely couldnt and would be uneffectful in the end.

In paragraph 6 another outside of the box thought was put into words from Dr. Huang ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that, too,"" The problem with this is that computers don't understand things, they are programmed to do what they are told. Only alive things ""understand"" which means to learn. If we put a program in our computer to read emotions then the computer will most likely only read that exact facial expression.

The use of technology to read emotional facial expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is to far fetched and unpractical. This is because we have teachers, emotions change constantly, emotions are sometimes hard to read, and computers can't ""understand"" how a human is feeling a all times.

f53fbe6,"Technology has always been changing. All the changes have improved our lifes for the better or for the worst. One of the newest technology is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This system can classify basic emotion by measuring your face muscles. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Three reasons for why are it helps modify the lesson, helps read non-verbal communication and helps produce emotions.

Many students have had an online assigment that was boring to them. The teachers might not have realized if the lesson was not interesting or the students didn't understand it, since the students were behind a screen. If the teachers had the FACS, the computer would be able to detect the students emotions and change up the lesson to make it more fun or understandable for the student. This would help the students learn more better by having a lesson that fits them. According to the creator, Dr. Huang, the computor would work like an a human instructor.

There are two ways a person communications to one another. Those two ways are verbal and nonverbal. According to Dr. Huang, the most human communication is nonverbal. The students use nonverbal communication, mostly to show how they feel about the assignment. So if the tecaher doesn't catch the student emotional expression the computer would. The computer will then notify the teacher about it so he can change up the assignment or explain the assignment better.

Many people who are feeling down, try to fake their smile. Well, according to the creator, FACS would be able to tell if it is forced. It is going to be able to that becuse it will measure the muscles on your face such as the zygomatic major, oculi pars palpabraeus, and the risoriuos. Even if it is fake eventually it would be able to produce actual happiness. This would work in a classroom, if the students are in a acting class and have to fake their facial expression to fit with the scene. The computor comes into this by reading the student's facial expression, and telling the student how the computer thinks the student feels.

In conclusion, the use of the FACS is valuable. It helps modify the lessions, helps read nonverbal communication, and helps produce emotions. It may come with its flaws, but we will improve it so it can be properly used in classrooms. FACS is the new future of the use of technology that will change the way we learn.

This new way of technology will help us understand what we can do to improve student's emotions in the classroom. This technology is valuable, it will help us know how students are feeling, help us figure out when someone is lying, and may also help produce happiness to students.

The Facial Action Coding System will give us an idea how the students are feeling during class. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""(Dr.Huang). With this technology we can now figure out what students are going through during class, and know if there needs to be a change to improve their learning skills. This technology would help teachers have an idea that the students are not following or undertanding the class. The teachers then can find new ways to modify the lesson to get the students on the right page.

This new technology will also help give clues when a student is lying. ""These muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,""(Making Mona Lisa Smile, D'Alto). This can also help teachers figure out if a student is lying about a serious problem. This technology will also help improve our schools and help find new ways to improve students emotions if other teachers or students know about their feelings.

The Facial Action Coding System can be a way to produce happiness to students. ""Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them,""(Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions). It is healthy that students smile rather than be angry, sad, or stressed. Practicing to create a smile is a good way to be happy.

In conclusion, this Facial Action Coding System is a valuable piece of technology. It is helpful in so many ways, like knowing how students around you are feeling, gives clues when a student is being untruthful, and may also cause happiness to students who are having a tough time. This technology should be used for schools all over the world. Technology improves everyday and we should take an advantage by using it all around in schools, work, or even at home.

This says that any face expression that is shows by a students the Facial Action Coding System can pick it up and compare it to the emotion the student is having. The FACS can help teachers recongize the emotions because the calculation of our emotions happens every day. Some people or friends might be able to pick up on how a students is feeling based on the way they look, but not all the time. Sometimes it is hard to pick up on how a person is feeling because their facial trait can convey different expression. Dr. Huang with his new computer software has similar anatomical information as electronic code to help and understand the emotions of people through different facial expression. FACS can be even more helpful to students in any classroom. The about 1 teacher for about 12 to 16 highschool students a class, the teacher might not be able to see you at a certain time. If the computer can pick up your emotion of confused it can better help you understand and modify the lesson for the students. The text says, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" This shows how FACS can also make class and school more enjoying and interesting. Not have to look at the same type of videos over and over, but being able to get different types of video. As humans it hard to try and understand each other because of how different we actually are. We don't really understand each other facial expression besides the ones we actually see. We don't know the difference between a real simile and a fake similie.

That why FACS would be good to use because it is programmed to know the difference between all facial expressions. It can help teachers understand students and can also help students inside the class room. If this is actually brought to schools and tested I feel it will have a be impact on students and teachers. You will probably see a change in students behaviors and grades with the helping of FACS.",3,7,0.8765254616737366
f5775fd,"In this article i read about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" was about the creator of the art frew how she normally felt which was not so cheerful but more like what she's a normal act she was as half as happy as she was she always was more in a good mood more than a bad. but as i look at the art created by Leonardo da Vinci's i can tell her mood its like a slightly smile but also a i dont care type of person like she's happy but also she can careless whats going on and how things are around her that slight smile on her face shows that she's not always angry but its more of a smerk like something you do when your kinda naughty about something. She's giving like kinda that evil eye. In this picture it also not just about her and her actions but look around her where shes's at look like a lonely river where its a thoughtful place where she can think and for me what sets ut off is the fact that this coloring donest really have any color as much as its just a copy and the real one got a slight color to it not alot of bright out there type of color its more of a ""ehh"" type like its there but not bright like how they express her feelings shes happy therefor its there but than it dont need to be.

There are some people that can see the emotions of people and some are herd to see then others. They are making technology to read the emotional expressions and that it knowns when your lieing. There are pictures that show emotion, people that see other peoples emotion, and now there making technology that reads emotional expressions.

First, of there are pictures of people and there always will be. In those pictures you can see someones emotion and how someone is feeling. Back then they only had pictures to see. From theose pictures most artist and people could see peoples emotions, but it was meanly the artist that could read someones emotion. The artist could see throw someones fake smile or if it was real. That's why there pictures showed how many emotion she had.

Next, there are some people that can read others emotion and for it's hard or they can see them. Everybody is different most people that read somebody's emotion is because there a love one or a every good friend and they can read your emotion. There is just other people that don't care. Most people should be able to see if your angry, sad or happy. Those emotions are easy to see, kids show it all the time even when there not feeling so good.

Finaly, there is technology being made that reads someones emotion. The technology even know's when it is a lie. So somebody can just take a picture of somebody and there emotion. There is going to be a person that lie's the technology. Technology isn't going to make you feel better. That person is going to need a love one or a close friend, to help them out.

There always going to be somebody close by that will help you out. Could be throw a picture and that could help you. Or a friends that sees you happy, sad, or mad. The technology might tell them there emotion, but wont help them out.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" could tell how you're feeling by reading your facial expressions. This could help in so many ways; as in to help others, to keep students awake in class also for good advertisement. According to the article "" Dr. Haung new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"".

By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This could change so many things for the better.

f60205d,"The Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman, it is a man-made computer, in which it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Many would say that this new break in technology is useless, but there is more that meets the eye when it comes to the Facial Action Coding System. This coding system can read the emotional expressions of any student in a classroom! This is extreamly useful as it can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, it will then modify the lesson to fit the needs of that student, and human communication is nonverbal so therfore the computers are trained to react like a human in any situation.

When a child is sitting in a classroom with many other students while the teacher is explaining a lesson plan, they might fall to boredom or simply be confused. Many students could say, that they have at one point or another felt overwhelmed by a certain lesson in their classroom. The Action Coding System can, as said by Dr. Huang, ""..recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Imagine having a computer that would allow you to read into the emotion of a student. This device could be the greatest asset to any teacher. Many students will subside their emotion for the thought of being cast out by their peers for not understanding a lesson, now with the Action Coding System created a student will not feel the pressure of being discriminated against, and teachers have a reliable source of technology to make sure their classrooms are being used to the best of their ability.

As well, the Action Coding System not only can scan a student's emotions, but when it finds a student confused or bored, it will modify the lesson for the child. As said by Dr, Huang, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This piece of technology can even modify a lesson plan for a child struggeling to understand the curriculum or a student who struggles with ADHD. A teacher with this device could always know what is happeing in her class and how his/her students are feeling. In a sense, the teacher can have a weight lifted off their soldiers as he/she knows all students are taken care of.

Finally, the Action Coding System is wired to run like an actual human being. Therefore, since humans are mostly nonverbal, the system will produce in the same way. Dr. Huang said, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, So computers need to understand that, too.""The computers will work in the same sense as an actual human. In a classroom, the students and teacher will feel as if they are being cared for by an actual human other than a piece of metal and plastic. This is a key attribute in the foundation of the product, as it is better to have a new technology that acts like a human, rather then a robot that tries to contol.

In conclusion, the Action Coding System is a must have in any classroom. It can recogzine when a student is becoming confused or bored, it can then modify the lesson, and it runs functionally like a human being. This piece of technology is universal and has a vivid array of uses.     ",5,7,0.9025628566741943
f61869e,"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems is valuable. This technology would help teachers and students help understand how their classmates are feeling. The use of this technology would help with the way students learn and could help prevent serious issues with the students.

By using Facial Action Coding Systems it would help students become more engaged in class. In the article by Nick D'Alto he states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". By using this new technology it would provide an effective learning way for each individual student. The computer would be able to reconize how each student is feeling then would modify to what helps each indiviual get engaged and learn. This technology would help students get better grades and it would customize to exaclty what helps them get engaged.

This new technology would also help you reconize exactly how each person is feeling. Many people are stuggling through depression or even worse things and they are so afraid to open up. Some people just don't know how to open up to anyone and this technology would help express what each person is feeling. In this article it state, ""Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conves happy, worried, etc"" (Nick D' Alto). Eventhough we might think we know how someone feels we never truly know what is going on. This technology could help bring in end to the depression that some students are going through alone.

This technology could also open up ways to reconize if people are lying. Nick D'Alto states, ""Faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". Being able to reconize how politicians or celebrities are feeling would help open up many truths to the world. For example if a student was to be lying you would be able to tell which could help out a lot in the classroom. Students might find it easy to lie which ends up getting the innocent introuble. This technology would bring an end to that.

The new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables us to identify humans emotions. This new technology would bring many different benefits to the world like helping people with their emotions, being able to reconize if people are lying, and it would help students become more engaged in their learning. Facial Action Coding System is a wonderful idea that should be brought into this world to help us get answers and help those who are going through a lot alone. ",5,7,0.867944598197937
f628167,"Computers have come a long way in the past few decades. Coming from computers that filled up an entire roomonly having so much as 2 gigabytes (GB) or smaller for memoryto having a computer that is smaller than your torso and can contain as much as 128 GB (or more) of memory. However, we have only started scratching the surface on the technology of facial recognition. Believe it or not, there is now software that canfor the most partread your emotions!

The software is the latest creation made by Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, who works in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. (1) Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman who is ""the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)"" (3).

How the computer works is that it creates a 3-D computer model of the face that incorporates all 44 major muscles of the human face into the model. Eckman has classfied these six basic emotions into the software: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. (3) Each emotion is associated with characteristic action units to differentiate between emotions. (3) Video imagery (4) is used to capture these action units. For example the text says: ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youre surprised;..."" (3). The computer captures all of that.

This advancement of technology is truly fascinating, however it can be harshly criticised by the public if it comes out to classrooms now. It's new and can only capture so much; they only considered using emotional features from six basic and distinct emotions that Eckman ensued into this innovation. (3)

It can also be compatible with one computer, so it wouldn't be practical or create a state of financial stability if a school had to buy one for each student. Even if it were software it could probably slow down a less-compatible device and could hinder the work process in a school for a machine whose sole purpose is to capture how a student scorns during a math lesson.

If the tech were to be efficient in speed and usage in a classroom or any other setting, then it should be a necessity in school. However, with programs such as Google, the computer just would not be necessary. In the text it says: ""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" (6) Google does that by taking information you search publicly in your own Google accounts.

As for identifying how students feel during class, as said in the text in paragraph six: "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts."" (6) Teachers are able to get a public opinion by using a program by Google Classroom to send a poll out to their students, or just by being amicable and approachable enough to let students ask questions about confusing material.

If the previous information can be proved wrong, then it would be good to have in a classroom. But how can a computer capture someone's emotions if they have their hand over their face or their head down? They simply can't help that type of situation. Also, humans are very complex creatures. People can act like they seem happy outwardly, even if they aren't. Some people can be born with facial deformities. Deformities in people's faces can be very unitelligable to the eyes of society, in some cases, or just stoic due to a chronic disease that causes muscle tissue to be stiff. The program would not be able to read people's emotions if they can't express it like most people can due to their conditions. Again, the program was designed for an average human face and only 6 emotions as a base. (3)

As a civilization, we are moving forward. It would not be a surprise if in a decade or two, every classroom has an emotion-reading computer that works efficiently for everyone. However, as of now, we are only merely scraping what is FACS tech and how to modify it into our everyday lives. Releasing this innovation to the public mow wouldn't be practical due to how new it is. But it would be cool to have something that works that way with little error.",4,7,0.7929587364196777
f686cd8,"How would education change for students if lessons were taught based on emotions? In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto , he informs the readers on a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) which is a computor software that can essentially 'read' or recognize human emotions by observing various facial expressions. He also explains the many ways FACS can improve the development for human and computer communication. This technology would be a great contribution because using it would keep many students in happy/better moods and because it could possibly improve a students performance in an online school setting.

Allowing this software to be used by many students could help them maintain a happy mood. In paragraph 6 , D'Alto writes,"" If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This type of feature will result in a student having a better experience because they would be more susceptible to having a smile on their face while doing any kind of work that could have been dreadful. But along with better moods, using this technology could also make a better student academically.

Another reason this technology should be adapted into many student computers is because it could improve a students performance on tests and schoolwork.The authuor writes in paragraph 6,"" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Being able to modify the lesson soley based on whether or not this software can pick up a students emotion is completely genuis. Through this students would be able to learn more efficently while maintaing their focus because the lesson would alter depending on their lack or growth of emotion.

This invention can produce many positive outcomes because it has the potential of keeping students happy and working while improving their performance. Many scholars today aren't looking forward to walking into a school building which would put their work ethic at a low, leading them into feeling like school just isn't for them. But if technolgy like FACS could be available to every kind of student the outcome would be mind boggling. All students would feel better and do better in school.",4,7,0.8723345994949341

First the begin with talking about the technological side of it .In paragraph 1 they being to to talk about what the mona lisa was actually expressing through her facial expression by using FACS ( faical action coding system). The mona lisa is one of the most famous and staple pieces of art. Their have been many debates on if the mona lisa was happy and using this technology proved she was 83% happy. They used FACS to figure out her emotions from that exact moment. in paragraph 2 they begin to talk about the use of the FACS computer. How they use it to figure emotions for intance the mona lisa's emotion. The process isnt that hard use stand in front the computer and make facial expressions and the computer can figure it out for you.

Secondly they being to talk about facial expression. In paragraph 4 Dr. Huang talks about how facial expressions are universal. facial expressions are truly universal it is key on figuring out how others around you could be feeling. In paragraph 5 they talk about how humans come with an impressive calculation to what people may be feeling such as friend and how we can tell the difference between each emotion. Humans come with bein able to understand human emotions through expressions but not always seeing as people can mask true emotions for instance at one point he beings to talk about different smile and which is real and which is fake.

Lastly he beings to talk about how it would be useful in a classroom enviroment. In paragraph 6 they talk about how if a student is using a computer and the computer has FACS ( facial action coding systems) that it will being to recognize if a student is confused and bored and will able to modify the lesson for the student to regain interest in the lesson. The student will be A able to pass his or hers class and B have fun and be interested while doing it. In paragraph 9 they talk about how it help a theater teacher and his actor ( his students) to be able to udnderstand the theory of emotions. Emotions are always around and may work in your favor from you getting a good grade to putting on a great performance FACS will be able to help to do that.

In conclusion FACS seems to be very useful from the class room to the stage FACS can be used for being able to fully understand somebody's emotions all by looking at their face .The author used technology , facial expressions , and students to do that .",4,7,0.8202926516532898
f6ccff9,"Within Nick D'Altos article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick helps me view the value of using technology to read ones emotional expressions. The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of a student within a classroom or ones facial expressions throughout a painting can help distinguish how one had felt. Technology can be used for many things and now those from the Facial Action Coding System has been using this new technology to read the expression given off of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. D'Alto helps put reasonings behind his new Facial Action COding Sytem by promising applications throughout yourself and throughout those in famous paintings.

When reading Nick's article the numerous questions about the Facial Coding System seemingly had been answered. Within the article many professors from different colleges had been developing different indept ways that humans can communicate with computers to help bring the software to a new level. Nick convinced the readers to fall in liking wiht this software due to tha fact that he persuaded them by stating what the computer does. Nick states that ""the process begings when the computer constructs a 3-D computer mode of the face"" which most likey brought more people into the idea of technology reading emetional expressions (para 3). Nick explains the basics of the technology along with the more indepth features that the computer is able to do considering how rare it is to have a software that can read human facial exoressions. Within th article it explains what the software can do such as ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness"" (para 3). This shows how the technology used can read many different emotions from those. Which persuades those to want to explore more into the software and how it actually serves a purpose.

This piece of software comes with many complex algorithims. The technology used is much more advnaced than your regualr software programs because it has to be able to read human expressions as well as the expressions off of those who have been painted. Within the article Nick gives us simple instructuons that can help us ""encode"" the different emotions we expirence as well as the how this technolgy can help us when figuring it out. Nick's instructions are placed within three steps and those steps are, ""Step one: Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. Step two: Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (""crows-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. And finally step three: Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes"" (para 7). These steps can help show how at home you can recieve the basics of the emotional expressions revealed although this software can help you determine the deeper aspects of ones emotions. Nick also states that ""it's all about those muscular action units"" which helps us undertsand that the muscles within our face dtermine a lot about our expressions and with the expressions that we project to those within the situations we are placed in (para 7). Emotional expressions people give off are often hidden and with this new technology software we can dig deeper into one's emotions as well as with those feelings in resemblance to the actions being taken place if it's a historical figure that we are scanning to find out the emtional expression of them.

The background inofrmation on the Facial Action Coding System was breif although its still uprising. Nick explains that the ""new software has been developed [to] [improve] accuracy in precieving the emotions of others"" which has shown many great examples on why this technology is useful (intro para). Within the article Nick explains how the software works but he also mentions who has been working on the software and how much knowledge that has been put into this software. Nick says that ""the software is the latest innovation from professor Thomas Huang,.. working in collaboration with professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam"" which helps us understand who had been putting in the knowledge of this software invention (para 1). Although professor Huang and professor Sebe were known as the starters of the inovvation, many of their colleagues had helped then and still help them brain storm better ideas and ways for their software.

After reading Nick's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" I believe that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students and those in paintings such as the Mona Lisa is very vaulable. What makes it valuable to me is the fact that it's hard to read the emotional expressions of those in life and those who have major aspects of today's history. Those who have made history and are nonliving to this day we can put this technology to use and help determine theire emotions thorughout images and it can help us discover deeper into the person themselves as well as the time period in history.

f6f4429,"Even though technology is a huge part of the world today to help with certain problem and can be really helpful to people. The author describes the FACS or Facial Action Coding System as a technology to shows a recognition to facial movement. In today's society we know that its alot of emotions being shown throughout the world no matter what's the case is. For example, emotions are hidden by certain people or even people that don't show emotions at all. To support my claim is that no matter if parents or anybody tells them something they will not show any type of emotion any type of way, so they use equipment or something such as the FACS technology program.

The author says that from using the FACS experiment that it will make you feel sightly happy. In my opinion that is not true because that when you are down or upset you wouldn't want to do a experiment just to make you feel happy because you would think the experiment was nonsense. The author also provided us with is that if you raises your eyebrowns when your suprises and around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger is true because the FACS could shows and tell your emotion at anytime and any place.

When looking at the Mona Lisa painting it was sucessful and was one of Leonardo da Vinci's biggest accomplishment was the painting of Mona Lisa. Some of the new comptuer software that can recognize emotions, It was sucessful because the software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois with collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe Of the University of Amsterdam.

Comparing school computer and FACS is that school computer can recognize if a students is bored , or even confused about a problem there doing on a website such as Mindplay, Khan Academy , Carnige Learning, and etc. The FACS is extermely helpful and useful is because the FACS materials can be expressive for video games or video surgery. It can also help with human communication that aew nonverbal including emotional communtication. By according to Dr. Huang notes he says "" So computers need to understand that too."".

Your home computer or work computer cannot modify Mona Lisa smile. To support my claim is in pargraph 7 it says "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. "" But you can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" the different emotions.

The author says in Pargraph 9 us that the FACS can give you happy face that it can acutally be useful.

It can be false because a fake smile is when you mouth widen alittle bit with no teeth showing , and when using the FACS it can probably not show it.

The FACS technology can be very helpful for counselor, teachers , deans, doctors and even more. When someone is mentally challenge or mentally disabled the counsleor can uses the FACS to identify the mental person emotions. It can be helpful with teachers and deans is to identify the different or emotion the child has. For examples, say a child is got bully in the cafeteria for his lunch money and he just walks out the cafeteria with a frown on his face and he doesn't want to show his emotion toward the dean and/or teacher so thats when they can used the FACS technology to figure out there emotions.

The FACS is very helpful for humans that performs the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. Of course, most of us can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look of there face , you can probably tell by the look of there faces when they are happy, sad, worried that why Lenardo da Vinci made the Mona Lisa picture and his crew from making the FACS technology. The author is giving us the mood of encouraging because without the FACS technology then we would never know how people feel when it comes down to the people that don't show emotions.

In conclusion , FACS is very useful in many different sceranio. If it wasnt for the FACS technology then we wouldn't know how kids,adults,students,teachers and etc feel. Another thing is that the FACS technology is very helpful because that it can tell if a student is bored , and/or even tired. While a regular computer can tell if the student is bored. I would reccomend this in schools,hostipals, doctors office , or even in the dentist area.   ",4,7,0.795677900314331
f705dc1,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a recent advancement in technology that can read emotions from facial expressions. Many people speculate where it could be used, from marketing to video games. Some might wonder whether it could be used in classrooms, which is a definitive ""No."" FACS is not valuable to read student's emotional expressions because the classroom shouldn't include emotion, it has better uses elsewhere, and is invasive of privacy.

Emotion shouldn't dictate the lesson in schools. In the passage, Mr. D'Alto quotes, "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" (6). Everyone has walked into class one day, seen the lesson and then silently grumbled to themselves. This type of emotion shouldn't change what the lesson is or how it is taught. The goal of teaching techniques is to effectively teach the broadest audience. This type of system would switch up the lesson for the few people who get confused easily, but then it hurts the majority's learning experience. This is why the classroom shouldn't include emotion.

Systems such as FACS have better economical value elsewhere. In the passage, Mr. D'Alto says, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" (6). This is one example of other industries that could utilize this type of technology. In the classroom, there is no economical value of being able to read the students emotions. Mr. D'Alto goes on to say, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery."" These are other industries that would love FACS-like technology. It's a better investment to use FACS elsewhere other than the classroom.

Privacy is held dear by many. FACS can be invasive of this. Some students may wish to save their grief for a counselor, therapy, or simply a designated time to cry. FACS completely disrespects this fact and exposes an individual to everyone else. In the passage, D'Alto quotes, "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, uncluding emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too.' "" (6). This quote implies that computers are not yet able to comprehend whether or not the individual wishes to be ""scanned"", for a lack of a better term. This can be invasive. Until technology reaches a point until this changes, FACS should stay out of the classroom where students may not wish to have their emotions expressed involuntarily.

In conclusion, FACS is not only worthless, but harmful to the learning quality of students. This is because it has better uses elsewhere, is a breach of privacy and includes emotion into the classroom. FACS is, and may never be suitable for a classroom environment.",5,7,0.8490138053894043
f72239d,"Have you ever experienced a whirlwind of emotions during a dull class? It can truly be a difficult experience attempting to explain to your teacher that you need time out from class in order to orient your mind back onto the subject at hand. With a new technology developed called FACS, or Facial Action Coding System, conveying problems to a teacher isn't difficult when that teacher can already read their students' faces. This innovation, created by Prof. Thomas Huang, can detect the emotions of humans through psychology and 3D computer models that track all 44 major muslces in the human a human visage. In a classroom, The use of FACS is undeniably valuable because it can set apart a real smile from a fake smile, understand the basic human emotions need to be identified in a classroom setting, and it could provide an easier learning environment for students with social issues.

Setting apart a real smile versus a fake smile can provide value in the way a teacher interacts with their student. These feelings are understood with the help of psychology from Dr Paul Eckman. The FACS aparatus uses 6 basic human emotions that can inevitably seperate a real smile versus a fake smile. As it states in the article, ""These muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Therefore, in a classroom setting, differintiating real vs fake can be valuable when a student isn't being truthful about their dog eating their homework. It can also decrease the amount of anxiety a student recieves when asked if they understand a subject, in front of the class. If a teacher can understand their emotions, it would facilitate having to step aside with the student and talk about their difficulties on a particular subject. Understanding the difference between a faux emotion and a real one can make a difference in the realm of teaching, just as understanding the six basic emotions can too.

Using psychology, the teacher can also understand the six basic emotions needed to understand in a classroom setting. With the help of psychologist Dr Paul Eckman, the emotions read by FACS are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Happiness and surprise are emotions most of us can read, therefore its understanding through the FACS machine isn't vital to be understood. Other emotions like anger can be important though. Identifying anger on the face of a student can keep other students safe by isolating the student from the others, which in turn could keep everyone safe from a potential rage-induced tantrum. It can also help knowing berforehand if a student is sensing dangerous emotions such as anger, fear and/or sadness. According to paragraph 9, ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" If a teacher knows some of her students are feeling any of the three previous emotions, producing a happy environment could help keep the students happy or bring their emotions to a higher level of happiness. It therefore is valuable in that aspect and also to students thank can have issues with talking to their teacher.

Just as identifying dangerous emotions is important, so is identifying uncomfortable situations that can therefore be easier for socially anxious students. According to Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" The former of those two emotions is vital to be identified because it can help teacher know when their students don't truly understand a lesson. Often, socially anxious students tend to keep their quesitons to themselves when they are confused about a topic out of fear of being juged as dumb or incompetent. They will go on without understanding which in turn can cause a decrease in their grades. If a teacher is able to read the true expression of their student, these type of situations can be avoided in order to create a better teaching experience for all the students.

In conclusion, FACS is without a doubt a valuable asset in a classroom environment because of its ability to identify real from fake, its understanding of the basic human emotions needed to be comprehended in a class, and because it facilitates learning for students with a fear of speaking.

In the future, seeing this innovation in a class setting would be an amazing feat for a step towards smarter teaching. With the help of Prof. Thomas Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman, a new future can be created. ",6,7,0.8406010866165161
f75538f,"Have you ever wondered the emotional expressions of students? Me too, which is why the Facial Action Coding System can help solve this problem. It compares everything to a ""neutral"" face, so you can see if you're one hundred percent happy, one hundred percent sad, etc. Each emotion will be distributed in the results of the test. Dr. Paul Eckman being the creator.

It can be used as an emotion indicator on students in a classroom. Dr. Paul Eckman has classified the tool to only six basic emotions, which he says,""Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" For example, he noticed that when people raised their eyebrows they became ""surprised."" Or if you tighten your lips, you show ""anger."" He sees signs of emotion with each expression the face makes.

Video imagery is even being used to spot emotions in pictures or paintings. The pictures being able to describe the faces of the children. Dr. Huang states that,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" So even though many kids have different emotional faces, each student is making the same expression. The software can even see mixed emotions, just like in ""Mona Lisa.""

We make the same calculations every day. For example, if you were a teacher looking at your students, you could most likely tell how someone was feeling by the look on their face. Dr. Huang says,""Artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" So da Vinci used an altered version of this way back when, but was mostly mental capabilities. The value of reading the students emotions, could become very helpful in seeing if a student is having trouble in class or with friends.

Muscle differences can even indicate a false emotion! The author says,""the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth, and in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" So if you catch one of your students smiling sideways at you, then you know they're treating you to a fake smile. Faces don't lie... if you notice a student false smiling then you may find that they are lying. Try not to use false smiles because you might get caught.

This technology is useful to sensing the emotions of the students in a classroom. If someone is having trouble with classwork, then this could help to determine the problem and find a fix. The video imagery is useful in finding emotion in old pictures from the past. Also, being able to check if someone is using a fake smile is quite handy in terms of the truth. All in all, the Facial Action Coding System is a handy tool that helps sense the students emotions.           ",3,7,0.8415522575378418

Reading the emotional experssion of students in a classroom should be allowed because it can detect if a student is not understanding the teacher. It's importent for teachers to be able to know how there students are doing in there class when knowing there emotions. In the article Dr. Huang says, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" "" then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrutor.

f7860d2,"No, this new technology is not useful at all because theres no need for a computer telling you how you should feel. How could a machine that doesnt have feeling detect how you are feeling even humans have trouble detecting thatand we have feelings. In a classroom this wouldnt be helpful because its not helping them in school with anything. That is what student want is help in school subjects not their feeling that we ahve friend and family to talk to not som random computer. Most of the time the computer would be wrong because someone could depressed with a happy face on.

In paragraph 1 it says that they tested this on a painting. How could the computer make a 3D model of the face on a picture that it flat. The information that is givin couldn't be accurate at this point. Also she had a strait face in the picture how could she be 83 percent happy if she showed no emotion in the original picture painted. Also, in paragraph 5 in lines 4 and 5 is says that they had to add to the picture so the computer could pick up the face and tell them what she was feeling.

In conclusion this would no be useful at all because its a computer that doesn't have any type of emotions or feeling trying to tell you what you are feeling. Every person has a different face and everyone has different feelings and thats hard for even a computer to understand. Humans have trouble identifying these feeling because no one knows what someone else is feeling except themselves. No computer in the world could tell you what you are feeling.

f78ab51,"The Facial Action Coding System also is calles the FACS is a interesting solfware. The can be use for great things, but human emotions are complicated. The system emotion need to be bigger cause human have more emotions then happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. I think that the FACS is bad for student to use right now.

The thing I do like abot the the solfware is that it can help alot of kids that wasn't tought right or just don't get certain things. For a solfware that can change the learning process just for you to make it more challenging or make it easier just for is amazing. This the way I look at the solfware will give everybody a better chance cause it not so straight forward as you read this and you have to understand or you can't pass on. Now It can find interesting things you like to read and it make people want to read. This machine also help the teachers cause they can't help every student if they have a class of 30 student.

This is were this solfware go wrong human have way more then six emotions. These emotion we have is very complicated to the point that we don't understand them some times. For a machine to change how we learn on facail expresion is bad because we can be sick and it change the actical cause it thing we are bored or disgusted. That might really like that artical. The same can be said if a person is in pain it can say that person is angry or sad. This is the big flaw with this machine even if it is rightthe teacher or someone can go look back at that and see everything you are feeling. that can be alittle to personal for some people.

This is my thought aboot the solfware. It is very great, and can be very helpful for a lot of people. The big flaws with it is that itcan be to personal for some people. The other big flaw with it the emotion part it vision it to narrow it need to be widen up cause it emotion people it might cagorize it under something it might not be.",3,7,0.7715834379196167
f79be82,"I feel like the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable for a lot of other things, but I don't think it would really be valuable for seeing what emotions students have because you're going to have a lot of students in a classroom with all different types of emotions. Plus what would it be good for anyway? Why would you need to know the students emotions? I think that it might be an invasion to privacy. I don't think everybody wants people to know how they're feeling and what emotions they're having.

Trying to get information from somebody you don't really know is an invasion of privacy in my opinion. I don't want a teacher that I barley know or if anybody trying to use this know how i'm feeling cause I just don't want people asking how I am all of the time. So if i'm sad and they use the Facial Action Coding System they'll probably think i'm always sad or depressed and feel bad for me and I don't want people feeling bad for me. Or if i'm mad and people know i'm mad and try to talk to me about it and maybe I don't want to talk about it, it would just make me even more mad because I already don't want to talk to anybody.

I think this technology is a great idea dependingon how you use it. Maybe cops can use it so solve crimes and it helps them out, that would be a good use for it. But if you're trying to use it for information on people and knowing what they;re feeling like all of the time isn't cool in my opinion. And maybe people are curious to know what kind of emotions people are having in very old paintings, that would be a great idea.

I think that it is good to use the technology to read the emotoinal expressioins on someones face. The reason i think this is beacuse maybe one student is sad and no one call tell that but maybe you can make them go from sad to happy just by talking to them. I can sometimes tell if someone is not felling happy or sad or just having a bad day.

In the start of paragraph four it says that we huamns perform this impressive ""calulation"" every day. I think that is very true about what it says. I think also that maby not everone can think that it is true but i belive it. The Mona Lisa demonstration it did bring a small smile on my face. Another good reason to have this is like what Huang said that it would recoginze someones face and it should tell the teacher if they are confused about that question.

I think that every thing that we use in this world that uses technology should be able to read your face emotional expression. In paragraph seven I think that its true that my home computer shouldn't be able to handle it. Also in paragraph seven it tell you to do face expressions and when i did it worked i was mad and then i was happy.

Everyone should try doing that and see if they like doing that.

f86b855,"Emotions are a vital part of human life. Although they are sometimes overlooked or seem to not be present simply by looking at someone's face, they are used every day. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" introduces information regarding a technology which is able to detect the most common emotions. While this invention is widely seen as incredible, if not revolutionary, the Facial Action Coding System's presence is not valuable in classrooms.

The Facial Action Coding System does not have much value when it comes to using this technology to read students' emotinal expressions. The technology itself, while advanced in certain ways, is not that much more effective than a teacher's or students's abiltiy to distinguish feelings. The author, in his article presenting the many positives of this technology, addresses the idea that the system is able, from a 3D model it has built, to analyze the msucles of the face, matching their activity to certain basic emotions. The technology's ability to recognize emotions based on facial features and human behavior is something that humans have been doing automatically for centuries. The specific muscle structure is not necessary to determining one's feelings, as their use show noticeable changes on the face and are visible to the naked eye. Although this might be quicker, the technology would not have much value for classroom situations, as teachers could easily, while paying more attention to their students, notice the same details, identify changes in emotion, and alter their ways of teaching accordingly. Overall, the human's ability to identify basic emotional expressions would render this technology rather unvaluable in classrooms.

Similarly, the purely scientific origin of the Facial Action Coding System decreases the value this technological innovation would have for students in a classroom. While it might be successful in identifying the emotions of students, the Facial Action Coding System relies purely on the muscle behavior and structure, as mentioned in the article, meaning that no other factors would be taken into consideration. Many factors other than emotion, such as fatigue, can alter a student's appearance or behavior. The coding system would most likely, as a result of these underlying factors, as well as the very limited amount of emotions it can perceive, make the technolgy unvaluable when comes times to read student's emotional expressions. The generalization of emotions detected would produce false or unaccurate results, rendering the program useless in classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System, due to its computerized nature and lack of human perception, would not be a valuable addition to classrooms.

The lack of privacy this new technology brings makes the invention unvaluable. While some may think this to be a good way to improve student's lives throughout the school day, this facial recognition would raise many questions and controversy regarding student privacy. As the author states in the article, the Facial Action Coding System could be implemented in computers with the purpose of regulating ads and personalizing them to someone's preferences, likes, and dislikes. This is not only unnecessary, but would mean having a constant stream of visual information regarding students being sorted and analyzed. If this were implemented in classrooms, a number of parents and students alike would find this to be an intrusion of privacy, resulting in complaints, debates and overall unnecessary problems added to the education system. While this innovation might be somewhat useful or bring more attention to student's feelings, the excessive problems and controversy it would create makes the student emotional expression detector technology unvaluable and not a good addition to school.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The technology, although it could properly analyze the muscles and facial structure of students in classrooms, could easily be matched by a teacher, does not take in all possible factors, and would conjure up many questions regarding privacy in schools. While this program would have little to no value in classes, it could provide help to investigative work.

Even though it looks like a good idea it would also be pointless .

To begin, all this programing and computers would be costing big bucks to the schools. Next, the schools would have to but the program and still have someone to install it. Futher on, They would have to pay someone to teach the studrents on how to use it ,and witch would been having to pay for that person . Lastly, the schools could use that money to fund classrooms for the students to have a better enviorment to learn.

Secondly , we can tell when someone is mad or sad , we dont need a computer to tell what a persons is feeling. This coud have school money. For example, in the passage it says ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Further on, even they said that by just a look at someones face you can tell what mood and feeling is. Lastly, its like we have our own program in our head.

Thrid of all, Going back to money the schools also would have to upgrade to better computers. According to the reading it says""Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Further on, this means the school would have to get rid of the regular computers and install way more expensive ones. Lastly, the school might not afford one for each student to use at once, so whats the point.

The program uses muscle identification to determine what emotion the person is making. A specific muscle is used to make an emotion. For example, the zygomatic major is used to move the lips up to make a smile. The zygomatic major and the risorius is used to force a smile like if you feel awkward, depressed, or upset but doesn't want to show it. So even the program can tell if you are forcing a smile or you are actually happily smiling.

Expressing emotions everyday could improve how you actually feel and you may get more out of life than you would with a straight face. People will think you are are happy if you smile, sad if you frown, content if you have a straight face, etc. People analyze how you are feeling to share iin your happiness, make you feel better so you are no longer sad, and calm you down if you are angry. With this program, people can now understand human emotions better than than naked eye.

This can help students and adults to see how they are actually feeling because some people don't even know how they feel.

This system can help students with their lifes. To demonstrate, in paragrapg 3 it states ""Eckman classified six basic emotions happyiness,suprised, anger, disgusted, fear,and sadness."" when a student is feeling depressed (no students should feel like that) a teacher doesn't know how the student is feeling out of the six basic emotions that Eckman descrided. Thus, the system will help teachers know how the student is feeling ;and if the student is not feeling good the teacher or the adult can ask why are they feeling that way and build a conection or a bond with the students.

Teachers can find this system useful because when they are teaching they can see if their students are confused or bored. To illastrate, in paragraph 4 it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements"" which means that using video or images is a new way to find out how people are feeling. Therefore, teachers can see how their students are feeling and see if their class is boring or not and they can see if their stuents are learning anything. This is an example of how this new system can help students and teachers.

Like example even we smile in front of people that doesn't express that we're really happy etc because sometimes people smile because they don't want to see other people's worrying for them so they're just choosing to smile in front of them. Like me sometime's if im with other people even l'm sad or angry, l don't what to show what's my real emotion because l'm just choosing to smile in front of them because i don't want them to worry about my emotion or something. The only people who can read or tell what's are emotion is no other than are parents because they know us better than other people. We been on their tummy for nine months so they are the only one who can really read or tell what are emotion.

""While looking in the mirror "" By looking in the mirror can't really explain or say what's are emotion are becuase mirror don't speak and it doens't tell your emotions. People use mirro just becuase they want to see what's on their face or if it's dirty or what, how they look before they go somewhere. Mirror just copying what were doing in front of the mirror like if you start talking ofcorse your twin face in the mirror also gonna start talking too,becuase mirror is just a piece of a glass that can't describe what's people's emotion. Mirror can copy what were doing but can't say what are emotion or feeling.

My opion for this topic i think its pretty stupid because its non of there bussines what my emotionals are and im sure others agree with me. Maybe they dont like to smile but they sure can be happy my dad always told me never juge a book its cover and thats what their doing.

I wouldnt like it because i dont want them to know what my emotions are because its my emotion i will deal with them i dont want know one eles to.

There is one good thing about this emtional problem if somone takes a picture and there sad and there thinking about ending their life somone can see it and contact someone and they could change their life around thats is on good thing i like it about.

If a website or app is detecting emotions from picture what makes you think it could detect emotions from a real peson. This ""new"" technology doesn't make any scense. Why would someone possibly let a machine tell them how there feeling. Theres no way possible that a painting has emotions, it may look sad or happy but it has no true emotions.

There are many different apps that do different things. Theres even a app that detects lies. These apps are fake. No cellphone app could really tell you if your lying or not. This technology should be tested out on many humans. Just to be sure.

fa17a90,"How many different emotions have you ever felt in your life? You cannot possibly know and remember every feeling you've ever had. Using the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea and an amazing thing that has been developed, however, there is no way it is accurate. The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look.

Though the face has the same muscles and bones in it, everyone has a different facial structure. Some peoples eyes are far apart, and some are closer together. Some people have more round faces, and others have more square shaped faces. The text states ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."", but some people may not get crow's-feet around thier eyes, and some peoples mouths may not stretch sideways like this. There are many other differences in peoples faceial structures, aside from these examples.

All people feel different emotions in their life. They can also feel multiple emotions at one time. Saying that a face coding system can detect all your emotions is absurd. People have been known to feel exitement, while feeling resentment, and all other combinations of emotions. Technology today doesn't have any way of recognizing all emotions of everyone. The passage says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" It is not hard to guess that humans are capable of feeling more than just six emotions alone or at the same time. This would mean that the recognizing emotons part of this system is inaccurate.

Acting and looking different than how you feel is an excellent way to hide your emotions. People do this almost on a daily basis. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Although this may be true some of the time, even smiling to hide a frown cannot always be dected by a friend. Unless clearly obvious, hiding emotions cannot easily be found. This adds to the previous reason of why the Facial Action Coding System would be inaccurate.

The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look. In conclusion, this system could be highly inaccurate and ineffective. Perhaps sometime in the future, when technology is much more developed, this system may work a little better, but it will still take many years to perfect the Facial Action Coding System.",4,7,0.7035974264144897
fa1fdf3,"The new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sytem would't be valuable computers to identity human emotions.

First,Dr Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to comunicate. Dr. Huang think that it won't make a differences by the new techonlogy. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,digust,fear,and sadness-and then associated each charachteristic movements of the facial muscles..Using video imagery,the new emotion recognition software these facial movements in a real face or Mona lisa. If a computer could identity then it should identy all 44 major muscles in the movement like humans.

Second,""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,""observes Dr. Huang.""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confued or bored""Dr. Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructo.""""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communicaton,""notes Dr. Huang.""So computers need to understand that,too.""

Then,Your home PC can't hanlde the complex algotithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. But we can wrtie down some simple instruction that""encode""different emotion. In fact,these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. It;s all about those muscular action units. Humans could tell a friend is feeling simply by he look on her or hise face. Of course,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that convy happy,worried.

Finally, A classroom of student could identify more then the new technology could do. Sometimes,human might smile from the outside but human could change their feeling. A classroom of student could see their friends by thier looks.

fa3f71a,"The facial action coding system i think that it is really cool it can identify emotions of students or anyone that wants to use it they can just to see what the system would say. So say one day you want to see what emotions your face describes you as and you think that your face describes you as happy but you could be suprised becasue the facial action coding system could say that your face has these emotions and you didn't even know if you had those emotions. But also that just shows you waht kind of technology that we have evolved to since the very first computer came out to now to where the system can scan your face and it can tell you the emotions that your face has in that certain picture.

In my opinnion i think that the Facial action coding system is really cool i think that it can help people figure out some of there emotions and it helps them see what ever it is that they want to know. But to use this technology for students i don't think it's a good idea because if the student is having a bad day and they go to school and they get there pictures taking then it runs through the system

and it shows like sad or something then the teacher might ask ehy they are sad or anything like that but the student might not want to share what happened but the teache knows the student is sad so the teacher will want to try and help but maybe the student just doesn't want any help. Also a student could be lying when they get there emotions like they could be smiling but they really aren't happy or something along that it can really revale something that the student doesn't want to get out. In all of this i think that if a student wants this then they can have the option to do so but the students who don't want this they don't have to do this it's only if they want to do it or are willing to volunteer.

The facial action coding system is really cool technology and it is new so there is probably a lot of people all excited for it just to give it a try or on how it works and all of that. But in all honesty they should not bring it into schools because students will have there own emotions and if they want to share they will but there are some students that will not want to share with others so this could make them really uncomfortable if they don't want to do this. But with this technology it will continue to evolve into better and better stuff but some of it students might not like at all.",3,7,0.8895961046218872
fa56b19,"Mona Lisa's emotions were recently tested and showed she was prodominantly happy in the picture she is so famous for. Her emotions were read using new software called the Facial Action Coding System or FACS for short. After the Mona Lisa scan, they saw that she was 83% happy, this is a positive for people who admire the Mona Lisa. Thus, A new software has came out and it did a positive thing already by reading the emotions of the Mona Lisa, a very admired painting.

The Facial Action Coding System is a system that reads the emotions of its subjectees, The program takes alot to run as it has to run many complex algorithims , which may be slow for a computer that is slow. It can be used in others places rather than just in paintings, it could be used to read the emotions of drivers before a crash takes place, This lets the cops know if the person was on anything, as his chemical levels would be at a disbalance.

Classrooms are a notorius place for students to fall asleep to the sounds of their teacher or to easily get off task and the teacher may not even know, but with the Facial Action Coding System, it could read the students emotions to see if they're up to date with whats going on in class, you could see if any of them are bored, or .distracted, this helps the lesson planner by planning more accordingly based on independent classroom statistics. Thus, classrooms are a good place for children to be, but they would be better off if they had fun while they had schools as well, this gives them the idea that school is fun and they should give it another shot.

The Facial Action Coding System is a software program that follows intense algorithums that allow it to the the amazing act of reading other emotions, this is very helpful in todays thoughts, it can be used by law enforcement and schools in America. Therefore, its uses are very important for the public and the federal government as it may use this technology for their own uses.

In the end, this technology that was just invented was a game changing techn ology, it can be used on both a psychological exam of just the study for students in a classroom. The FAC System successfully read the emotions of the notroius Mona Lisa, a famous painting from a very long time ago. Thus, the Facs system was a game changing break through that will likely be incorporated in finding statistics or just reading your students emotions.",3,7,0.8573297262191772
fa9b6e1,"Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the ""Mona Lisa"". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom. The use of this technology to read the expressions of students in a learning envionement can help students learn more efffectivly by allowing for immediate feedback from a student allowing for the quick shift of a lesson plan, and being able to help and support students emotionally.

This technology can help get immediate feedback from students. In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine. Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it. While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System. The technology could understand emotion of students in present time. A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues. They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it. Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student. This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn. totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms.

To continue, the FACS technology would help students be more emotionally stable. While school is a vaulable place to learn new information and facts, it is really a place for children to grow and become more independent and better human beings. While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable. The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers. High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling. If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer. The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached.

While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways. However, while some arguements may be warranted, many are based off of falsehoods. To begin, emotion can be understood on a scientific level. Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.

In conclusion, the ability to read the actual emotion and reactions of students in class rooms is extremely valuable because it allows for greater understanding and excitment of a subject, along with the ability to help students be emotionally stable. If this technology is implemented into schools, studnets will overall do better, feel better and make a brighter world for tomorrow. FACS is something revolutionary that hopefully all of us can learn somthing from.",6,7,0.8464750647544861

Sometimes i keep asking myself why others can't put themselves together and be a parther and why they treat humans like them bad. Its doesn't matter anymore in this world if God died for us and he forgive us we have to the same thing to others. Forgiveness is a big choice, all we need right now is to have a big smile in our face i know it gonna be hard but if we trust in ourself we can do it nothing is hard in life you just give it a try.

facc03a,"I believe that using the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System will be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can calculate the emotional expressions that are given on your face. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces. This calculating can result in to participation in the classroom. It can tell what all the students are feeling so the teacher can help them to get back to work on what subject they are working on.

There are muscles that can signify what a person is feeling, and the FACS can do that job. The FACS then looks at the characteristic of the movements in the face. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. And they figure out these emotions by comparing a neutral face, which is showing no emotion. Humans also use this method to see how or what someone feels.

The FACS is really valuable to read the faces of students in a classroom. Its expected to show brilliant work in the software industries. And the FACS can modify the lessons on how the classrooms feelings are. The FACS is the next software to be used. And i think it is valuable to use in a classromm of students.",2,7,0.8552608489990234

The use of this technology can help teachers ferther understand how there students are feeling and there for make the nessary adjustments to help student success go up. In the story ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author states that we can now we can actually calculate emotion just with math,there are six basic emotions that the computer can read happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness all the computer has to do is associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles and it can begin to calculate the emotions your feeling. The technologhy will also be able to tell when a student is pretending to be happy there for the teacher will be able to help that student feel better and help in a different way from the happier students. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D a model of a face, all 44mmuscles must move in the right way for it to work but once it does the system will work nicely.

The only down side is that the computers you have at home can't handle the complex agorithms used to decode their own and the mona lisa's smile. But once they return to school the will receve the same help that they obtained before.

In conclusion how will Facial Action Coding System be a good addtion to our schools? The software will finally alwolled us to finally know how our students will feel. It states in the text that the mona lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and finally 2 percent angry, this system was able to read this just from a painting and it will be able to do a lot more in the futre.

If a student were not able to identify their emotions when seeing a therapist or school counsoler, then this device would work best their specifically because therapists/counsolers are trained to help with humans and their emotions.

Let's say that students are in a class to learn about psychology or somethig of the sort. It would be very useful to find out what a person is feeling down to the percent. This device would also be helpful there because it tells you about the muscles that move to show a certain emotion. 'For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when surprised...' (D'Alto paragraph 3); students can study their muscles that make their emotions by learning about these muscles.

In paragraph 9, it states '...Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them'. Just by making faces and using this technology, students can learn so so much more about their emotions on a deep level that can help in many ways. It would benefit students, teachers, therapists, and more.

In conclusion, this device and technology can help many different people in many ways. Students can learn about their facial muslces, therapists can help their clients learn to identify what emotions they are feeling, parents can hep understand how their children are feeling, etc etc. Students can even help one another feel better in small classroom situatioins all together.",3,7,0.8556519746780396

First I think that the technology is valuable because expressions are one of the keys of understand ourselves and each other.

Because of all the advanced tasks that the new technology can do such as help tell the truth, keep attention to task at hand, help fit itself to specific needs and create better entertainment. This new technology will come with great benefits and is definetly a helpful recource that should be implmented into classrooms and other facilities to ensure a better and more productive daily life.

The first quote that supports my claim is ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of mona lisa."" This quote supports my claim because it tells what the facial action coding system can do.

The second quote that supports my claim is ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This quote supports my claim because this quote is saying how some people might not be able to tell what someones emotions are so the facial action coding system could help them do that.

The last quote that supports my claim is when Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This quote supports my claim because Dr. Huang says that it could help recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

If a student is having a hard time in class and is stressed out or even getting mad the teacher can help them. I believe this to still be true and maybe one day the facial action coding system will help us in the class room or anywhere all over the world.                  ",2,7,0.8566433787345886
fba7e12,"There are many things a computer can do and could tell you if it could. Computers know many things about you and what things you like without even telling you, it comes from your way of expression and thinking. Would it be cool determine how someone really feels by using an computer software? Yes it could. For example students in a classroom when you look around people around you might have different expressions when it comes to different things. Some expressions can't be determined always by an human eye, people around you may look sad or happy and etc. but, that is only what you see within the human eye.

All people have many different expressions than just one expression that you in your class may appear to see. Expression is determined not only by how the face looks like or how the mouth looks, It is all determined by the muscles in the human face like cheek bones. All the studies made by you and others, not always computer or any source of science.

This person named Dr. Huang thought in his head that computers can already determine many things in a humans preference by the things a human finds appealing or disturbing. Dr. Huang predicted that since the web can determine all things by preferences it could the modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Most people spend many hours nonverbal and on technology to realize how a person might feel next to them without even paying attention so Dr. Huang noted that and figured out computers know so much that they could understand that too.

Like mirriors or anything that is reflectable can determine how you may feel when you look at yourself no matter if you groom or stare. If your in a classroom a teacher, computer, etc might ask you to describe a picture which I know this happened many times before, but it might ask and people may give variety answers that you might think is right as well. With an software it can determine how the person or something might really feel.

By the help of professor Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe they decided to create a 3-D model on a software with 44 different muscle models like humans facial expressions and did test to figure the percentage of an human face isn't that cool. This came to use on the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. Leonardo studies of anatomy which he uses on the painting made it look like he painted a lady which appeals to be smiling but also has other expressions which was also thought by the two scientists. The fundamentals of the computers unique ways gave percentages of the painting. How you might ask? By the following of stretched muscles which are called zygomatic and different muscles called risorius.

This is amazing so even using this can determine how a person feels in your daily life especially being around others in a classroom because maybe not everyone might feel the same as you might. It also gives more descriptions of how a person may feels than how you may think within the human eye. This could be helpful all around the human community studies of others. Instead of asking people whats wrong or how they are feeling you would already know by using the Facial Action Coding System. Do you think your guesses of how you may feel or others is right? Give the system a check maybe it might prove you wrong?            ",4,7,0.7666502594947815
fbf29c5,"A new program, the Facial Action Coding System, regonizes facial emotions. It can show the different emotions on a person's face by the different muscles they're using. Prof. Thomas Huang's facial recognition technology is valuable for a classroom. It would show whether or not a student is enjoying the lesson and adjust lessons to the liking of the student.

First, the program could understand humans better to fit our needs. The article says, """"Most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."""" This is telling how computers need to better understand how humans work, as in the different ways we convey emotions and thought. It also needs to know the different varients of human emotion. The article states, ""By weighing the diffferent units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. each expression is compared against a neutral face."" This explains how the program wouldn't show a regular ""happy"" emotion and compare a human's to it, but instead start with no emotion and see which muscles are used to find the emotion. For example, the article states, ""She's 83 precent happy, 9 percent disgust, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" That's the emotion of da Vinici's painting, ""Mona Lisa"". The software states exaclty what her emotions are, not just one emotion.

Then, the program could act like a teacher and fix lessons to better the student. The article says, """"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modifty the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""" This shows that Dr. Huang believes that his technology could, in the future, rearrange lessons and work them for the student better when working on computers. The article then states, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" The technology would personalize the computer to fit the user better, making it beneficial for a student.

The software helps identify different emotions in humans, including the ""Mona Lisa"". It can show different varieties of human emotions and then find if someone is enjoying what they're seeing online. This helps students by the program recognizing how they're feeling about lessons, then adjusting them to fit their needs. The program would really make a big difference for online teaching.",4,7,0.8660501837730408

The use of this new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because we should not always trust our eyes, it helps us to better understand what it is we're looking at, and knowing what others around you and what your looking at, can reflect on how you feel as a person.

When looking at a picture of someone smiling, you may think they're happy. Although they're smiling, that smile could surely be fake. What if they threw the smile on so people would think that they're okay? Maybe they just dont want to be bothered. You can't always trust what it is, that your eye is seeing. With this technology, you don't have to trust your eyes to tell how the person in this work of art is feeling. With a few simple steps, you can tell what the emotions in the paintings are. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how mcuh this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad"".

This new technology helps us better understand what it is that we are looking at. This Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The Facial Action Coding System gathers what muscular action units are being used. The muscular action units is how the Coding System collects its data and registers what it is the person is feeling. ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"".

Whether it's a family picture you're looking at, or a painting by the greatest painter of all time, If it makes you happy, hinting a genuine smile, can reflect on how you feel. If you know that a painting of sunflowers, is something that you like to see, can cheer you up a little. Although you're not going to be the happiest person in the world because you looked at a picture/painting you enjoy seeing, you will for sure be more happy! ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"".

In all reality, technology has had a huge impact on our lives, and we would be lost if it was to be taken from us. This technology may have one of the biggest impacts on our life since smarthphones had first came out. Maybe this will soon be the ""style"". The use of this new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because we should not always trust our eyes, it helps us to better understand what it is we're looking at, and knowing what others around you and what your looking at, can reflect on how you feel as a person.

fcd09f7,"This article tells us the technology of facial and emotion recognitions. Everyday we may walk around with expressions on our faces that shows how we feel or what you want to show others what you're feeling. Other times we put on a happy face but on the inside we're actually pretty sad. Dr. Paul is the creator fo FACS (Facial Action Coding System). I am for this new way of knowing someone's emotions just looking at a picture and especially through paintings.

Dr. Paul is the creator of FACS. He was able to identify variety of emotions in one picture or painting. Eckman have found the basic emotions such as happy, surprise, angery, disgusted, fear, and saddness. They were also able to identify mixed feelings. Some examples of knowing what one person might be thinking. When a person raises their eyebrows they are showing that they are surprise. When a person shows that they are angry their eyebrows point inward and eyes are focused intently at someone else. When we are with our friends we are able to know what they are thinking or feeling most of the time. We know when they are happy, sad, or even excited, this technology allows us to look into it deeper. Unlike our PC computers at home, it doesn't have that advance technology that can read our expressions. In the article is says that they would write dome simple codings to different emotions. In an environment like school it would be interesting to use this type of technology among the students. FACS would help the teachers to identify which students are paying attention and who are bored just using this.

In the painting of Mona Lisa they were able to figure that there was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguished, 6 fearful, and 2 percent anger. This technoloy can be helpful in many ways. It calculates emotions through movements in a picture and varies in different emotions, and are able to calculate mixed feelings. Some students go through some hard times and others may not see the things they are going through just looking at their faces. Some students are able to show the opposite emotion of what they are feeling to guard themselves and not be seen as vulnerable.                ",2,7,0.823757529258728
fcd7af0,"There has been a new breakthrough in computer facial recognition software. This breakthrough is called the Facial Action Coding System, also known as the FACS. The FACS is a facial recongnition software that is used to determine someone or something's emotions. In the article, this software is used on the Mona Lisa, to determine that she is eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. Some people beleive that this software could be useful in classroms, and i agree to an extent. This software would not be as useful to students in a traditional brick and mortar school as it would to somebody taking an online schooling program. I am an online school sudent and the FACS could be helpful in several ways.

The first way that this software could be helpful to a student would be detecting if they are bored. Much like a teacher would, if this software noticed that a student was bored during class, it could take action to engage the student more. An example of this could be if a student was simply reading through a lesson, and became disinterested. The computer could then suggest that the student watch a video on the subject instead. This would bring the student a different type of lesson, and slightly change up their day to engage them more.

Another way that this software could be useful in an online schooling program is it could detect when its students were feeling frustrated. If a student is feeling frustrated, then the software could take action against that, having the student either take a break, or putting the student in contact with a teacher so that they could work through the subject together. This would help the program have a better graduation rate, as it would help struggling students.

The final way that the FACS could be useful is to detect if a given student was sad. There is a rising problem among students, and that problem is mental illness. The most common mental illness is depression, and this program could help with that on some cases. The FACS could help by detecting that the student is sad, and alerting the student's parents, or possibly even a teacher to get in contact with the student, and talk with them about their emotions. This system is obviously not perfect, but it could help detecting early signs of depression among students.

Overall, the FACS could be very useful to an online schooling program. The software could be used to detect if a student is bored, if a student is frustrated, or even if a student was sad. These are all of the reasons that the FACS would be helpful in an online schooling program.",4,7,0.8337445259094238

""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal""

Dr. Huang observes, In my opinion computers should not learn or know how to read your emotions even thought it could help in a classroom by recognizing when a student is becoming confused or bored, i don't think every single human expressions of each emotions are the same, in the introduction of this article we can read that the ""New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other"" but how accurate can it be? for example when your not making any face expressions or when you're not feeling any of those 6 expressions listed what is the computer going to say, In paragraph 7 and 8 we can see how the computers ""can indicate the difference between a genuine smiled and a forced one"" this is possible by using the Zygomaric major muscles but what about when you're making a forced sad face can the computer recognize that too?

because it doesn't really clarify in the article. Other reason why i think computers should not be able to read or recognized your emotions is because even if it does help teachers and advertisers see what the other people is feeling i don't think it would be very usefull.

fd79800,"Sitting in class and listening to the teacher drone on and on about a particular subject that one finds completely boring sounds like the perfect time to take a nap right? Well, Thomas Huang, of the Bekham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has been working with Prof to create a system that can detect human emotions through facial expressions. Facial Action Coding System is highly beneficial for students' emotions in the classroom. People try to decipher other peoples' emotions on a day to day basis, so much so that body language and facial expressions is a key part to how the human populace communicates. Considering the fact that all emotions are universal, the system can detect any one person's emotions and even break down mixed feelings. Try to imagine the scenario with the boring teacher, but when the Facial Action Coding System detects the class as bored the lesson changes into something much more interesting and captures the attention of the class and enabling a happier school environment.

The students at SCHOOL_NAME see the same faces day in and day out to the point in which one can all tell the emotions of others through their face, however sometimes it is hard to get a read on how people are feeling. In paragraph five, Nick D'Alto states,""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."" The significance this piece of textual evidence has is precisely that if a student had a problem with expressing their emotions or even themselves could not describe what they are feeling the computer system would be able to help by diagnosing the emotion and that could prompt the student to open up to a trusted adult so that they can move past ther hardships and focus on school. Humans use facial expressons to communicate just as much as verbal communication. When you understand another person's emotions you can begin to communicate effectively with said person.

Emotions are universal; whether you are from America or China your facial expressions will be compatible with each other. Expressing emotions is a good way to communicate even if you can not effectively verbally communicate with someone. This coding system can even decipher mixed feelings so that one can always effectively communicate even if the person in question does not speak the same language as you. The text states in paragraph four,""By weighing the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).""

Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, so when a student is watching an online lesson and becomes bored, the system will detect that and find a more interesting lesson to try to re-grab the students attention. Some may say that this system is ineffective because it can only graph the emotions of people. However, this system allows the computer to alter the subject's learning path to create a yearning to learn. Students need to want to learn in order to actually retain the information that is ground into their head on a day to day basis. When a student learns something they are particulary interested in their ability to remember and recall the information increases incredibly. The author writes,""""A classroom computer could recognize when a studen is becoming confused of bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"""" (p. 6). The goal for the human race is to become more intelligent and to do so we need the help of computers to keep our youth interested in the world has to offer in the educational system.

Every day humans try to detect what other people feel and usually can pick up only tiny hints. If we were to bring the Facial Actioin Coding System into schools the students would benefit tremendiously! Non-verbal communication is just as important as verbal communication and this system will enable a more productive school day by keeping the students interested in what they learn, keeping communication effective, and a bonus is that all emotions are universal so it does not matter who you want to communicate with language barrior or not.

fe0199f,"The Facial Action Coding System is a new software that can detect how people are feeling by their facial emotions. This would be very helpful to teachers and students in the classroom. As Nick D'Alto writes, ""- faces don't lie"". This system was invented by Professor Thomas Huang and his colleagues who have been working on finding easier ways that humans and computers can interact with each other. The Facial Action Coding System would be a very useful and a resourceful tool in the classroom.

One way this software could be used in school, is it could help students focus.

Sometimes when kids are upset at school, they tend to hide it. This leads to them not talking about it. Along with not talking aout it, they could be thinking a lot about the situation rather than their school work. It makes it a struggle to focus at school when something non-school related is going on. This makes it hard them to concentrate and pay attention in class. Dr. Paul Eckman, a psychologist, says that there are six emotions. These classified emotions are ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". By using this system at school, teachers would be able to find out what the student is feeling or why they are acting up.

Another reason is that it's often hard for students to be outgoing at school. Especially if they're more on the quiet side and would rather not talk a lot. Mr. Huang writes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."". A lot of students at school tend to be shy. With computers understanding their emotionals, it could tell the teacher when they are confused without them having to raise their hand in front of the whole classrom.

The last reason that bringing this system to schools and classrooms would be helpful is because it creates emotion. Nick D'Alto writes, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". From personal experience, friends tend to mock their friends. There has been a theory that says by mocking someone else's facial expressions, may lead to them feeling that same way. For example, when the teacher is in a good mood, it makes things seem more relaxed, and the students seems to be happier. Smiling is said to be contagious.

In conclusion, bringing the Facial Action Coding System to schools would be a valuable decision. By the electronic code that is built into the software, emotions would be able to be recognized easier. Even in the case that the emotions are mixed up, the system would still be able to recognize them. By bring this software to schools, it would increase the students learning, communication skills, and help them focus more during school hours.  ",4,7,0.8736732602119446

New computer technology based around FACS (facial Action Coding System) created by Dr. Paul Eckman can read your emotions. I know you might be asking yourself, ""why would I want that?"" but allow me to further introduce you to this program and why it's such a good idea.

First let me ask you, what harm would it honestly do? Why wouldn't you want this software? I understand that it might sound silly and that technology is really getting ahead of time but it's truely a brilliant idea. The program can single-handedly understand any of your six emotions. This includes, happiness, surprise, anger, fear, sadness and disgust. It completes these tasks by recognizing facial muscles and how they move to create these emotions.

This software might also be able to help people have a better understanding of friends emotions and how to make their peers and friends feel better. The program after identifying your emotions, finds ways to up your mood a little. The article states; ""For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" If someone didn't want to have this software, they might as well be saying they don't want to be happy!

The computer software can also identify mixed emotions, such as the example they gave of Mona Lisa stating; ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This is ideal, contrary to the idea that someone might only be feeling one emotion at the time, as it is unlikely. If these computers can find a way to make people happy or to make people smile, the world could be a better place. The software could help other people understand feelings and emotions better and allow for more emotion-realted communication to take action. Why would anyone turn this awesome opportunity down?

If you have experienced feeling emotions and not understanding why or what you're feeling, this software is for you. Even if you haven't experienced this, this softwear could be the reason you smile and if that isn't in your interests,

you should rethink. Overall, there is no down-side to this program. It can tell what you're feeling by your 44 major muscles located in your face. It can also sense your mixed emotions as well.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, so I'm going to be talking about the way this project works, some examples on how you can use it and how can your computer know which muscles you are using.

The way this project works is that when a computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face all of the 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles this is called an action unit. So any movement that your face does the computer it's going to be able to recognize your feelings and it's going to tell you the way you feel and the way you can get entartain or better.

An exanple is that your frontails pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised the orbicularis oris tightens your lips and shows anger so the computer it's going to be able to recognize the way your feeling and it's going to pop up with a face doing the same thing that you're doing

The way you can use it is by making weird faces moving your face muscles and smiling putting mad faces sad faces and disgusting faces. So lets say that you start laughing in front of the computer, you're basically using it because you're showing your face to the computer and the computer tries to recognize the muscles that you are using. The computer has all the muscles that your face has so it's pretty easy to recogize your feelings. For example if you are doing an eye exercise the computer will automatically recognize how are you feeling like tired bored happy mad or sad, it depends on the movements that you do with your eyes.

The way the computer knows the muscles that you're using is by looking at your face and see which what parts of your face are being use.

So as soon as the computer recognizes your actions you'll see faces on the computer doing the same thing that you ere doing. When you fake smile the computer will recognize whether you are foreal or not because the muscles that are supposed to be in movement are zygomatic major and the risorius, so when you fake smile your mouth stretches sideways and you can't play the computer very easily becasue the computer knows what muscles are being use.

So I think that having a computer that recogizes your feelings is a great idea because imagine you're feeling happy and you sit down in front of a computer and out of nowhere the computer tells you that you are feeling sad even know you're feeling happy I think that's cool because no one else can recognize your feelings the way the computer does and you're going to be surprised when the computer tells you your feelings.",2,7,0.808837354183197

This can actuallyThe way a computer can determine how you feel is by

"" The process begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model to the face; all major muscles is called an action unit."" This heps the computer by your facial expression to know how your feeling and uses a 3-D model to your face only. 'Your orbicularis oris {aound your mouth} tightens your lips to show you are mad."" Your lips is also a way the computer can tell how your feeling.

The way peple coummicate is by "" Most humans communcation is a nonverbal, including emotional communcation,"" notes Dr. Huang. Thos means you don't need words for someone to be able to see how you are feeling. "" In a false smile, the mouth is strected sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Mostly likely a computer is able to analyze you when you are making a fake smile that that's what that means.

This was a sussceful experience because ""acording to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your faical muscles not only expresses emotions, but alsomany even help poduce them"" It meant that the Facial feedback was able to determine more than just emotions. It can also cause to emotions to people. "" Putting on happy face actually works.""

I believe a lot of people will agree to use this form of techology to know their students are feeling. This seems to be a very great idea more futher out in the future. The techology use to know a faical expression can also tell us 6 different types of emotions like happiness, surprised, anger, fear, and sadness. I believe every teacher would like to know how each and every student if feeling and if they are going through something at that moment.",3,7,0.7785647511482239
ff982af,"In order to detect human emotions these students are saying thrie computer can do it. I dont believe this and i'll tell you why.

Computers can tell you how u fell on the outside but can't tell you about the inside. Emotions are not based on facial expressions. I can smile through pain but the computer won't tell you that. Many people cause decive you with there emotions. The person who created this only uses six basic emotions that can decive you on the outside.

Explaining human emotions are very difficult because you cant actually tell how they feel on the inside. The emotions the show on the outside could decive how you see things. You should take the time to ask the person how they really feel after you get the results to see how accurate the computer really is. This computer cause not actually help these researchers.

Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional coomunication. With this being said i do not believe any computer in the 21st century is advanced enough to read true human emotion. Maybe one day somebody will invent the greatest computer ever. But as of right now emotion truly can't be read unless the person themselves actually tells you.    ",2,7,0.8362797498703003

At the Beckman Istitute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois, Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague are created just that. they call it ""Facial Action Coding System"". This system could be put into computers to keep track of your emotions. Maybe even by tracking your emotions, you could be happier.

The process works by using a 3-D computer of your face; all 44 major muscles. Than is the Facial Action Coding System associates the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddnesswith each movement of the facial muscles.

Most human communication is nonverbal, even through we may not relize it, we always show our emotions. The facial expression for each emotion are unviersal. Using the Facial Action Coding System, it can track humans emotion or even a painting such as the Mona Lisa.

As humans we are always feeling something, weather its anger, saddness, or happiness. I think it would be of great value to have this technology at school, and put into our computers. Not all kids can learn the same way, which means kids can not be teached in the same way. If the student is working on the computer and they do not understand the lesson. The computer could change the lesson to teach it a differnt way.

All in all, I think this kind of technology could be very useful, not only in school but for psychologist and other who study the human body. Our emotions say alot about us amd if that is how most of us communicate; we should know more about them.

ffae2b1,"Isn't it crazy that technology has come so far that a computer can read a persons exact emotion right down to the exact calculation? Yes, there is now computer software that can read emotions, right down to the percent of each emotion. This software, created by Professor Thomas Huang and collaborated with Professor Nicu Sebe. This kind of technology should be known to everyone, especially kids in school.

This software knows every muscle in the face and understand the anatomy of these muscles. "" Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huand relies on the work of psychlogists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facical Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated with each characteristic movoments of the facial muscles."" This process can read every muscle in the face and link an emotion with the given expression. It can even identify mixed emotions by weighing different units. For a human, isn't always easy to read mixed emotions.

""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day."" Yes, humans read peoples faces on a day to day basis and can usually figure out the nonverbal emotion of a person, but for a person who doesn't know anatomy, this can be hard to place the exact emotion with the facical expression they are looking at. This software can even tell when a person is faking a smile, which again, isn't always easy for a human to pick up on. ""its all about those muscular action units."" Which, is very important for a kid to know.

Technology is all around people every day, and kids know how to work technology better than most other people; therefore, they should be taught this new software and understand it. This new technology can really do wonders "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huand predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" All kids learn in different ways, which can become a struggle for students. It isn't easy trying to learn when you just cannot understand it the way it is being taught to you, and this technology could completely change that. School could become way less stressful if it is being modified for each students understanding.

A lot of human communuication is nonverbal, with different signals and facial expressions humans make, its not always easy for a person to understand these nonverbal signals. Which, is why this technology could be revolutionary to kids in school.",4,7,0.8040992617607117
