Having the responceability to have licens and a lot of kids will take advantage of it so im gonna say that the Driverless Cars are good for us, the atmosphere, the people with money and down payments on vehicals. Not most people have vehicals because of the payment range and if we can change that who knows we might not have to have buses, taxi, etc any more, and the people will have more money to take care of their children and its also gonna help with car crashes and lowering how many we have every year or so. Allowing kids16+ to drive the less crashes will help majorly. Also with the insureance itll cost less but will the insurance go out of buisness ? If the law says we do have to still have insurance to have a vehical we buy then i doubt that theyll go out of buisness.",1,3,0.6832460165023804
868ba1d,"I believe that driverless cars are a great invention for the people. It would be great for anybody in my personal opinion. I believe the sensors, Dubbed LIDAR, and GPS receiver are great idea's fr a driverless car. Say you spilled a drink while you were driving and you needed to grab the cup before the liquid from the cup gets all over your school bag, or work porfolio? You could always switch on the ""driverless"" car feature and clean it up real quick before you started driving again. I like how you can switch this on and off. Say you were feeling sleepy and you were awake but you were kinda drowsy? You could use the driverless care feature. The vibrateing seats from Gm, The flashing lights informing you that there's something you need to do so take the wheel. Those are both great and fantastic idea's.

Safety is a big concern in these cars. Can the car stop when needed? can the car set off air bags in the middle of a crash so the crash is less deadly and there are no fatalities?

yes, i believe the cars in the future will be able to do everything listed above, and more. If somebody is injured by a smart car i believe it should be the manufactures fault, but only if the person driving the car is actually using the smart car feature. If the person driving the car isn't using the feature then the driver should be held responsible",2,3,0.8236198425292969
f4add9c,"I believe that driverless cars should not be built. They seem like a good idea at the first look but imagine there would be so many downsides to owning one of these vehicles. First of all they would be extremely expensive to build and buy and the delicate snesors used in these vehicles could easly be broken or damaged. Also people would have the ability to hack into the servers that would run these vehicles and essentially make them do whatever they wanted, whether it be to wreck or cause an accident. And what would happen if one of these vehicles were to malfunction and cause the death of a driver, passenger, or pedestrian. I feel there are too many risks and downsides to be producing these vehicles.

Even if we were to make these vehicles mainstream and sell them people would find something wrong with them like they always do. And if not that they would find ways around safety measures added to the vehicles. For example preasure sensors could be added to the steering wheel to only allow the cars to drive if someone has there hands on it, but someone could just tightly wrap tape or something else around the wheel instead and cause an accident. This is why I think these vehicles should not be produced and sold.",2,3,0.8546832799911499
5a40c03,"Have you ever thought about the future? As a day gose by we have to start think about what will today be in 10 years from now. i can picture my self getting into a car that has automatic opeing doors and the car driving it self. We are living in a society where new thing are being made every day, just like the new cool hoverbored.

There are many pros to the new invention people are coming out with. Several of the ones i have herd are about how they will make life a lot easier. For example look at the new hover bored, a flat surface that can move right left back forward yes this make life easier but it also effects us. You could be walking places that will give you good extercise.

When you take a look at car driving themselfs that is kinda scary though. just imagen what could happen if the car took a wrong turn and there was a big trailer coming that could be your last day alive. We see on televison and movies that have long been fascinted with cas that could drive themselves but that is all but in reality that is all fanticy made by a computer. this world has taken it a step to far on how we are just being here for nothing why dont we just have computer do everything. Because that is what it looks like.

In conclusion I feel that this is a very hard topic to arrgue about beuase yes I would like to make life easier but at the same time I want it to be safe. I feel like we should be take life nice and slow and more car driving on there own for a bit firther in the future.   ",2,3,0.5382265448570251
774fac3,"I perosnally don't think it's a good idea,because most people don't really pay attention to the road if someone,and or,something else is driving for them.Driveless cars are pointless if it's not fully automatic,why is it called ""driveless"" when you still have to pay attentoin and drive at certain points in time ?

With the driveless car there could be less accidents,because of the sensors and flashing lights in the car,but overall the driveless car still isn't a good idea because there will have to be some sort of binary code on the road for the car to read,with that it would be way to expensive to pratically work .

In conclusion the driveless cars' wouldn't be a good idea,because people wouldn't really drive anymore,they're just partially driving and that wouldn't be fair to anyone who loves driving, if in the future they made every car ""driveless"".

In the future,how would having driveless cars' help our economy out ? How do they plan on saving fuel?What if the car just shuts down,who fault would it be? Those are the things that i want to know.Say the car is driving by it's self and it crashes into something who would really be blamed,i think it should be the car manufacturer , because if it isn't the persons' turn to drive,why should they be the reason that the crash happened ?

3818643,"Imagine a world where you literally don't need to do a thing. Where supposely you are in a safer world with drieverless cars roaming your streets. More technology will only increase the risks of getting into an accident.

First off, I strongly disaggre with this concept as a whole. As the story says, ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no ones buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"". Even if it doesn't say, but if we start to produce driverless cars then how will we be able to travel through the country. By feet? Yes, it will save us money from paying to much for fuel; also ""we"" will be getting to things much later.

Meanwhile, Google has built cars where they are somewhat driverless, but still need human skills at moments. In paragraph 2 it further explains, ""Google cars aren't driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"". This was around 2009 and later on in 2013 Google picks up their game. Now, BMW's can function at a higher speed and has special sensors. This just shows us that we basically don't need to be in the car; but they have yet made it to that point.

In the near future, Google wants to have other options for example. In paragraph 9, ""Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Manufactures are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" There is no reason for this to be happening to society. This is going to incease more accidents, becaause of our ignorance.

All in all, if in 2020 there were driverless cars roaming around in the streets; then this will be a bad place to live at. The reason for disagreeing with this is strongly base on health. The driverless cars today shouldn't even be named driverless cars, because they don't come close to it. The more advancments we add, the more dangerous the car becomes. Us just sitting in the drivers seat and letting the car take over is plain just nonsense. Flying cars is something I would agree to, now that is safer.     ",3,3,0.7374752759933472
9b7a85c,"When I think of driverless cars I think of cars driving down the road with no one in them, but I also think of how many problems could go wrong with these cars. People could get hurt in a car accident because of something the driverless cars do. I am against the driverless cars for these reasons; They are unsafe, unreliable, and so many things could go wrong with them. If the driver that is suppose to be in the driverless car falls asleep and the car alarm doesn't go off when in need of help it could crash and the individual in the driverless car could die from the crash. I feel the car is unreliable for that reasoning.

These cars are unsafe because if the car was to get out of control and the individual of the car couldn't control it because it was to hard to control it could hit a kid or a adult. So many things could go wrong with these driverless cars. It could be that the individuals that are suppose to take over did something wrong but if they didn't have to take over in the first place then there would be less accidents. In conclusion I feel like the driverless cars are going to be a waste of time and money because they are going to result in more deaths and traumas. More car accidents are going to be reported every year and the individuals of the driverless cars are going to be held responsible because it would be there fault when really it was the driverless car that got out of control. Google Cofounder ""Sergey Brin"" says ""Such cars would fundamentally chage the world."" I believe that the only way these cars are going to chage the world is cause more deaths and injuries in the world and it's going to be the faults of the cars and the individuals inside the driverless cars are going to get charged with the charges because they are suppose to be the ""drivers"" of these so called driverless cars . If they are so driverless the why do they have to have individuals take over whenever they are in need of help? I believe the way things are going now are just fine. You don't see humans calling for help when there is a wreck or roadwork so why should so called smarter driverless cars need the help of humans if they are suppose to be taking our places on the road?",3,3,0.8701205253601074
9ac9cfc,"There are a lot of mixed opinions about driveless cars. Some are against it and some totally support the idea of it. I support it because I think that it will be easier and faster way to get somewhere and it can be safer which is very important. And while others are against it because it can be dangerous and involve a lot of reckless driving which can lead to accidents. Technology these days have improved from before and it is better now which allows us to make better technology.

Sensors are very important for a driveless car and have improved over the last decade and they can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine which allows better respnse and control than human driving could manage alone. There have been furthur improvements in the sensors and computer hardwawre and software which will make driving safer and it is leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own. Even though some of the technology needed hasn't been made yet some believe that we are catching up to technology necessary to make a driveless car. Though in the past couple of years several car brands have started developing cars that can handle driving functions such as they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but they are all designed to notify the driver when the car requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers are also considering putting in cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. They are also hoping to bring in heads-up dispay signs that can turned off instantly if the driver needs to take over. The in-car system is actually a safety feature which is a big concern, While those who are against it think that it can be reckless driving and cause accidents and it can lead to conflicts regarding who is at fault with injuring someone.

I think that as time goes technology will get better and advance more which can lead to manufacturers making driveless cars. Safety is very important and I think that it can be safer and a faster way to get somewhere. There are manufacturers making cars that are not completely driveless but I think that soon we will have driveless cars selling everywhere.",3,3,0.8535345196723938
9cd6ef9,"Driverless cars have both their prositives and negatives. The idea that cars will be use half of the fuel today is good thing for air pollution and that they will offer more flexibility than a bus is also. Some negatives would include that they will invade your privacy and that traffic laws might not advance as the car industry does.

Cars will use ""half the fuel of today's taxis"". This would be a positive because then there will be less air pollution. A person that is part of the fuel industry might bring up the fact that with that the fuel economy will start to decrease. There will not be much profit and that will not be good for them. Driverless cars will ""offer more flexibility than a bus"". This would be good for people that need to get to work fastser or get somewhere else faster. Buses have to make stops as they go whereas this car would not. Sergey Brin ""beleives such cars would fundamentally change the world.

These driverless cars could potentially use ""cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" This idea would leave drivers with very less privacy in these cars. You will not know when you are being watched. One other big negative part of driverless cars is that they traffic laws might not advance along with the cars. In order for all of this to work out you would need for everyone to work along.

Driverless cars may be the future that people will have to adapt to. Many people play a vital role in this because many things will have to change. I think that they should not be the future because I do not like the idea that they will invade privacy. You will not know who is watching you at any given time. You will not know if you are even being watched. This can make drivers feel as if they are not being trusted. Some people may disagree with that because after all it does have many postive aspects.

Many scientists and engineers are working vigoursly to bring this driverless car dream to reality, which could mean that those very same imaginary cars that drive themselves in the disney movie ""Cars"" could be on the streets pretty soon. Although, I do enjoy new technology ""driverless cars "" is a technology in which I don't want to see developed or used. These cars cause more harm than good and so far have not been perfected at all as there is not one, not one fully driverless car, meaning that all of the driverless cars need a human to assist it. Many of these new cars are not ready and really wont be much of an assistance when ready, as they have quite a few more problems with them.

For example, the closest fully driverless car is a Telsa that willl be released sometime in 2016 that can drive by itself 90 percent of the time. Also these cars are not neccessarily the safest either as multiple states have made laws banning the use of these type of cars. The states have stated that they are not completely safe drivers( the autopilet driver) and that it is just not safe to allow cars to drive themselves. Another big controversy that these cars have started the debate on whether the human driver or manufacturer should be faulted with an accident. These are just some of the reasons people should stick to driving themselves around.

So, now do you trust technology to keep you safe? How do you feel about a car driving you around? Well, driverless cars still have quite a bit of kinks to fix in their whole operation before they set out on the road. However, driving on your own and making sure you and family gets home safely wouldn't be such a bad idea to me either.

9606866,"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is about the present and future of driverless cars. In it the author presented both positive and negative aspectes of the driverless cars. After reading the article I am for driverless cars, because they will minimize the amount of accidents on the road and they could allow the ""driver"" of the car to be doing something other than driving the car.

In my first reason for saying that I was for driverless cars I said that they would reduce the amout of accidents on the road. I say this because in the article the author talks about how google have had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 and they haven't crashed. This shows how safe the driverless cars are. If these cars were on the road over normal cars they would prevent the driver error accidents, in turn minimizing the amount of accidents.

My other reason for being for driverless cars is they would allow the ""driver"" of the car to be doing something other than driving. BMW has been working on this feature of the driverless cars. They use a headsup displays in the car the show a form of entertainment and information systems to entertain the diver. And sence the driverless cars still need some driver assistance the display instantly turns off when the driver is need. This feature is not in a normal car. If the driver was need and they were texting the phone wouldn't turn off, there for making the driverless cars safer.

I am for driverless car for the reason of ""drivers"" being able to something other than driving the car and driverless cars could minimize the amount of accidents on the road.      ",3,3,0.8340314626693726
acaec30,"New cars that drive on their own, sounds fun right? Well think again. Diverless cars should not be used thoughout the world. Diverless cars are not counted as driverless because people will still have to take control of them while in traffic zones, and during other occasions. Not everyone will be able to afford one of these driverless cars so people who usually ride in taxes or buses will no longer have that option. Also, cameras were thought of to be put in these cars to watch divers to make sure people are paying attention even though they are not driving to insure their safety if the driver has to take control, but that is invasion of privacy.

Why would you go out to buy a car that is ""driverless"" when you need to still have to drive it at any given time, and still have to watch the road? That defeats the whole purpose of having a car that drives on it's own. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" It says ""All are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills, such as navagating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"".

If driverless cars become the new car than many people who take the bus, and ride taxis will be unable to have rides to their locations anymore. Especially if all other types of cars are got rid of. A lot of low income families rely on a taxi, train, bus, or even a subway as a cheaper way to get around because they cannot afford a car. That means they would be walking while higher class people are riding in a driverless car. The argument for supporters of driverless cars was ""The cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Still it does not change the matter that people would still have to walk to get to where they need to go if they cannot afford a driverless car.

Some people believe that diverless cars will be a good thing because it is a peak of our technology, they also think that the driverless cars will be able to help people stay focused on the road just as the article says ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" But that statement is not exactly true. If a person is put in a car that drives on it's own they are going to get more distracted and choose to be on their phones rather than paying attention to their surroundings because a driverless car is made to, drive on it's own.

That is why driverless cars should not be made, or even thought to be created. In reality, they are a distraction, they do not fufill their purpose, and they would end up costing way more than they are worth. ",4,3,0.8280761241912842
c63b3bc,"My position on driverless cars is that they are a misunderstood, underestimated, and misrepresented technological revolution that can change the transportation system completely for the better.

The technology used in these vehicles are designed to be perfectly accurate with sensors, laser technology, and a self updating 3D software that has greater awareness than that of a human driver.

These cars also take advantage of their programming capabilites to more efficiently brake and prevent accidents. The computerization of the ""driver"" will ensure that texting, alcohol, and other common driving problems are ruled out completely. In addition to these safety features the driverless cars will always roll back to their ultimate and final safety feature; the driver himself.

The technology used in driverless cars consist primarily of sensors and laser technology.

The document describes the LIDAR sensor; ""it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings"" (paragraph 4) .

This shows that the LIDAR sensor creates a perfect 3D model of all of its surroundings, meaning that it has a 360 degree field of view, and a higher sense of awareness than an ordinary human being with a field of view much smaller than that.

Sensors are another key technology used in the driverless car.

In Paragraph 5 the document states that ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers.

The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"".

This fact again enforces the boost in safety that driverless cars would bring.

Programs in the vehicle would take advantage of their domain over the individual functions of the machinery, and manipulate it to create a more responsive braking system that will prevent skidding and roll-overs.

Texting and driving, drinking and driving, and driving under the influence of other drugs are just some of the many bad habits that humans partake in that drastically increases the chance of a crash occuring.

These problems would see a significant decrease, as it is impossible for a computer to ingest a substance that would hinder its performance.

Texting is a program completely seperate from what the vehicle would use to operate and drive, so it would not be an issue in the slightest.

Most concern toward driverless cars is the basic idea of a driverless car - it has no driver.

People are reluctant to put their life in the hands of a machine, and rightfully so.

Technology will always have its glitches and quirks that lead to failure.

However, these mistakes would happen much less frequently as technology advances.

As stated in paragraph 5 ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars tha can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

Another point to consider is that coded programming will not make silly ""human errors"" that lead to many accidents.

When active, a 3D software program attached to a fully aware 3D laser scanner will never be caught off guard, and will never day dream.

To further address the concern of lack of human intervention, these vehicles are designed to put full control back in the hands of the driver at the first sign of uncertainty.

This is seen in paragraph 7 with the quote ""In fact, none of the cars develped so far are completely driverless.

They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating throught work zones and around accidents.

This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to rake over when the situation requires"".

The vehicle will not attempt to navigate an obstacle that it is not prepared for.

One technology that manufactures are considering ensures that the driver keeps his/her eyes on the road at all times.

This is seen in paragraph 7 when it says that ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road.

While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver"".

This reliance on the driver ensures that human interference is always possible.

Driverless cars are an underestimated and somewhat feared technology that can help prevent the thousands of deaths that occur each year due to driving accidents.

With a little research and enlightenment on the topic, one can learn about the levels of safety that driverless cars can bring, and understand just how capable the technology used is now, and how capable it will become in the future.",4,3,0.7717934846878052

Driverless cars throw people off because how could a car be driverless when the driver still has to be paying attention to the road? The driver has to be prepared at all times to be ready to take over the wheel. Drivers can not fully rely on driverless cars because drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, drivers are trusting a computer with their life, and the dangers of bordem behind the wheel.

Drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, even if the ""driverless"" car is driving. The driverless car can not drive through work zones or around accidents, so the driver has to take control. The driver has to stay alert and ready for anything to come their way. The Google car announces when the driver should be ready to take control, but shouldn't a driverless car be able to drive on it's own? Eventhough the car can drive itself, the driver is still in position like they're going to drive too.

Drivers are trusting a computer based opperator with their life. What if the car was to get in an accident? Whose fault would it be? Drivers can't fully trust a computer to drive their car because they computer could mess up, and could cause an accident. What if a kid were riding a bike, and were to suddenly fall into the street and the driverless car did not read it? That would cause a big uproar for driverless cars. They are not proven to be 100% safe for the world around us.

The dangers of bordem of not driving could be very serious as well. The driver has to pay attention to the road at all times, but they are not driving. This could cause serious bordem, and could lead to falling asleep behind the wheel. At least when driving is occoured the driver has something to do.

Now a driverless car is not a bad idea. The text says that driverless cars use half the fuel that cars use today, and that driverless cars have driven half a million miles without a crash. Driverless cars could be the future, but there would still need to be a lot of work done to the cars to make sure they are completely safe for drivers. Instally cameras in the car would also help with teenagers, and some adults to not be behind the wheel on their phone, which could lead to less accidents. So, driverless cars are a good thing that could come into society.

Driverless cars sound dangerous right now, but as technology advances, they could help in the future. As of right now, driverless cars not be fully relied on because drivers still have to pay attention to the road, computers can crash, and the dangers of falling asleep behind the wheel could be dangerous.

The dream of not having to actually drive your car something every driver dreams about. Mainly because of the responsiblity and stress that is placed on your shoulder as you get into that drivers seat. Whether you're an inexperienced driver or not this could be very beneficial.

Not only do you have to be cautious of other drivers but you have to remained focused on the road. So for a student driver, or perhaps an elder who may be too impaired with medication to drive, this driveless car could benefit them. This could lower the emotional strain you have about grandma not seeing that vehicle pull out in front of her or your child crashing into another driver because they may have been texting.

For a driver education vehicle, I think this could be a good teaching device. If you look at all of the accidents that have happened while in the process of learning the rules of the road cpuld save a lot of lives. The benefits of the car, such as knowing how close you are to bumping into another vehicle, could help someone who maybe parrelle parking. The vehicle will know if you are too close to the curb you are, or may parrallel park for you!

So, in conclusion, what is my position on driverless cars? I support the idea of this vehicle however, referring to my first statement, I don't think we will ever have a vehicle that is completely driverless. Even if a computer takes over your driving, you still have to watch the road and navigate, as said in paragraph 7 of the article.

Yes, the fantasy of having a completely driverless car seems like a good idea for drivers, and teen drivers such as myself, but this could result in people revolting against the safe regulations required when you're required to follow when behind that wheel. Why wouldn't anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't they get bored waiting for their turn to drive? No, they wouldn't they still need to take caution to the road and be prepared to break, turn, and accelerate just incase the computer doesn't do it for them! Once you're behind the wheel, even if that car you're in drives itself, you still are in control and your hand still need to be on that wheel!      ",4,3,0.7250825762748718
4a3ef9f,"I think that driverless cars are definatley an option for transportation in the future for us. However, as much as it would decrease our pollution and fuel consumption, it would take far too long to settle out cases whenever accidents do happen. I think there would be more problems than that as well. With smart cars driving on the roads, there would most likely need to be smart roads for the cars to drive on. Lastly, the cost of a smart car, with all the technology that comes with it, would be far too expensive for the average citizen to purchase.

With new technology comes problems and errors in the technology. With cars driving on public roads at highway speeds, any problem could result in a big accident. If those problems were to occur, there would be piles upon piles or settlement cases needing to be worked out. Companies manufacturing these cars would be losing popularity and money when these accidents occur. Also, the question running through everyone's minds will be, ""Who's fault is it?"" People would be raging if they had to pay the bills of an accident if they were not even driving it.

As stated in the article, driverless cars will most likely need smart roads with built-in sensors in them, to operate. If that's the case, only major interstates and

highways will have smartcars. Unless the country gets enough money to make smart cars drive in every road in America. Which would probably cost billions and trillions of dollars. I do not think an country for that matter is ready for an expense like that. For me, it is just something i cannot see happening anytime soon.

In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it says that a driver will most likely need to be in the drivers seat in case of an emergency. However, how is it possible for a driver to be focused on what is going on if they are not physically driving the car. It does say in the artical that manufacturers could include montitors for the drivers to watch somthing while they sit in the driver's seat. But with all of this technology, how is an everday working man supposed to be able to afford one of these cars? I would expect one of these cars to cost twice as much as a brand new car today. I do not think it will be that popular if they are not cheap enough for anyone to buy.

As I mentioned above, there are many problems that could occur if these driverless smart cars would be put on the roads. The problem of who's fault is it would be the biggest. As for a problem for the cities and states, the cost of the roads would definately hurt them. Also for the everyday citizen, the cost of buying one of these cars would be a feat in itself. I do think driverless cars are something we should reach for, but I do think we should wait on that until all the the problems that come with it are settled. ",4,3,0.8894054293632507

The car begins to make a left turn at a green light, but suddenly, a semi drives into the right side of your car and knocks you out cold. Next thing you know, you're in the hospital next to your wife and kids. The random objects that the sensors in your car cannot pick up could cost you your life and/or your emotional well-being. If these cars malfunction, the same situation will happen time and time again.

Back to the previous situation, you decide to take it to court against the car manufacturers, but where does the fault really lie? The manufacturers pay for the best lawyer around and you are left with what you can afford. The problem with these driverless cars is that they are poised to have lawsuits happen and that manufacturers will rarely have to make the financial contributions needed in order pay for these situations. Families will be left in shambles trying to pay for these lawsuits, and the companies will nothing to help. Even if laws were changed and the liability issues were solved like it suggests in the article, the distress that these cars bring will add up.

Others would argue that driverless cars will prevent more crashes whereas in reality there will be about the same amount. They would also say that manufacturers would this would help in the goal of making life easier. However, these cars would make more negative headlines than positive headlines. In the end, the negatives outweigh the benefits.

All in all, driverless cars are not the answer in making the world a better place. Driverless cars would still make the same mistakes that people make and have many safety issues. Also, the lawsuits that these cars would create would leave families and people penniless after trying to obtain financial help from the companies.",4,3,0.7617797255516052

Driverless cars could change the world for the better. They could make our lives easier and less stressful. Driverless cars could save lives, save time, and save money. These cars would be a great replacement for the manual cars used today. Driverless cars could benefit our society greatly.

This new invention of cars without drivers could save many lives. Each year thousands of citizens die, or are injured due to car accidents. These accidents are caused mainly by drivers. If cars continue to need drivers, many more deaths will result from this horrible choice. The drivers of these vehicles could be drunk, driving illegally without a valid license, texting, or distracted, resulting in car crashes. The possibilities as to why a person driving a car could get into an accident are endless! However, with no unsuitable driver at the wheel, roads all over the world will become much safer. If ,instead of a driver, the car is automated and drives by itself, people could rid the world of unsafe drivers. With these driverless cars, thousands of lives all over the world could be spared.

Driverless cars could save people time. According to paragraph two in the article, Google's driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Less crashes would result in less traffic jams. Without traffic jams, citizens would be able to get to their destination quicker and easier. Driverless cars could also save time by not having to constantly run into blocked roads. Due to the driverless cars being automated and controlled by an automated system, the system will most likely be able to detect the quickest route to the preferred destination. Therefore, driverless cars could be an advantage to us by saving us time.

With the invention of the driverless car, homo sapiens (humans) would be able to save money. The first product of the driverless car is not bound to be cheap, but as time progresses, the cost of this new car will eventually go down. According to paragraph one in the provided article, the driverless cars would use half the fuel of today's cars and would offer far more flexibility than a bus. Gas is a very expensive fuel. However, if citizens were to only need to pay for half of the money they pay for gas today, then they could save a lot of money that could be used for more important investments. Also, the driverless cars could result in less car crashes, which would result in not having to pay for damage repair. Overall, the driverless cars would not only your save life, but your money too.

The driverless cars could benefit our lives. They would be able to not only improve the way people live today, but they would also have the power to save lives, save time, and save money. This new car design could be the exact replacement, for the manual car used today, our society has been looking for. With these cars, students would also be able to focus on their schoolwork more, rather than on passing their driving exam. They could change life as people know it. The driverless cars would fundamentally change the world for the better.",5,3,0.8967243432998657
aa5918f,"Today, there are advance technology in the society such as computers, cars, cell phones, and etc but no one ever tried to develop an driverless cars. Today in our society, many people tried to develop new technologies because things are getting more advanced an effective. Driverless cars are one of their plan, where the cars has sensors and know what to do. I agree the development of driverless cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there is still alert in the car.

The driverless cars should be develop and introduced to the soiety because the cars uses less fuel than the cars we used today. The text states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" From this example we can tell that the cars is great because they used less fuel than the the cars we sued today. Thus, people do not have to worried about they will ran out the fuel when they're driving. Most of the people loved to use cars that used less fuels because they do not have to spend much money on the fuel. The text also states, ""Offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This example shows that the driverless cars have more rooms than a bus. People to sit in a place where there is not croweded because it's comfortable. Driverless cars solved the overcroweded the problem because it got more spaces. Thus, I agree the development of the cars.

While the driverless cars used less fuel, the cars can drive million miles without a crash. The text states, ""Their cars have driven more than half million miles without a crush."" This example tells us that the car is safer than the cars we drive today. If a car can drive million miles without any crashing then we considered it's an great car because most of the cars were not safe and it gets into car accident very often.

The most important is that there are still alert in the car. The text states, ""...Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of hallways."" This example shows that when there is something happened to the car, the cars will alert the driver that there is something going on but most of the cars do not have that kind of technique. Second, the text states, ""Dealing with comlicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This example shows that when there is an major accidents or traffic issues then the car will alert you to move out the car quickly before anything happened. In other hand, people disagree to develop the driverless cars. The text states, ""Why would anyone want a driverless cars that still needs a driver?"" They claimed that the driverless cars should do everything by itself instead having the dirver controlling it. They think there is no difference if we use a normal car. I disagree with them because it's safer if we have a real driver in the car, they'll prevent anything bad happened.

Driverless cars can have more advanced technique in the future when there are more people supporting it. Thus, we should not give up on developing the cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there are still alert in the car that helped people to know what happened.

d9738d3,"Driverless cars aren't really driverless and may even cause more problems on the road. One negative aspect is that eventually the ability to drive a car would wither away and die. For example, if you took a one year old baby and cooked for and fed him until he was eighteen, would he be able to cook? Even if he watched you cook, he can never cook how you cook because he was never taught the skill. It wasn't needed. So just like that, manual driving can be eradicated for generations to come. Eventually, would anyone know how to drive?

Driverless cars are a thing of the future, but are they really better for us? Not necessarily. Although, there are just as many good things as there are bad. If a driver is exhausted and wanted to relax after a long day at work, then the driverless car can drive him home and into his bed. But maybe driving the car was the only thing keeping him awake and alert. There are solutions to this problem, the article states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" But does this eradicate any threats or problems of driving driveless cars? But they aren't all bad. There are just as many positive characteristics then there are negative. But I believe that many issues will arise in the future.

Of course, they aren't completely driverless, but I strongly believe that driverless cars are more trouble than they are worth. Well that's a lie, because they're actually worth a lot. This introduces my next topic, inflation, of sorts. Even if all of the good overcomes the bad, the money value would increase exponentially. You think cars are expensive now? With all of the new technology and saftey features the car is now 5 times more than its original price. Not to mention if something needs to be replaced, how long will it take to make the part? What are the repercussions of ""fixed"" car parts? How expensive is one car part going to cost? Maybe even more than the car itself.

Furthermore, if the driverless car does get into a wreck, who is at fault? The article also states that new laws will be enabled due to liability coverage. If the technology failed, or just malfunctioned, would it be the manufactor's fault, or the drivers? Moreover, this opens up multiple scam oppertunities. Car companies have been known to scam people for their wealth, this is cutting edge ""scam material."" Car companies can rig a car to make it seem like it's perfect, and make it malfunction later to blame the driver. This can cause the problems between multiple car companies and their consumers.

These are some of the more minor issues. Mechanical products are not perfect, they have equally as many flaws as humans do. This can result in the loss of lives, the initial poverty increase, and even the simple result of losing the ability to manually drive a car. These are minor problems to car companies, but to one individual, it can cause many, many problems. But there are good things about these smart cars as well.

Retrogress back to paragraph two when I stated, ""There are just as many postive characteristics as there are negative."" I reiterate, there are more bad things than good, but there are some very good aspects. Such as, being able to drive safely and do other stuff that wasn't appropriate while driving such as watching your kid, doing some paperwork, and even able to send a text message without endangering others around them. These are only some aspects, what about the ability to make traffic run exponentially fast and safe. That is a positive aspect for all. But previous problems have arisen and they are the ""hallmark"" for inefficient driverless cars.

Nonetheless, I believe that driverless cars are not as reliable as many might think. I also believe that the thought of leisure while driving somewhere is a spontaneous oppertunity. These aspects may change life as we know it. Add them all up and it's clear to see that these ""smart cars"" aren't so smart after all.",6,3,0.8775312900543213
