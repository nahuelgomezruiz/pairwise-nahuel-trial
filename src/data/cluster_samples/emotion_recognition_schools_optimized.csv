185b01a,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions to see humans' reactions while they are using their computers. Computers can recognize emotions by the way you look, and it is allow to the computers to understand your feelings, and to change the topic because they used this technology to see Mona Lisa's emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" When technology developed they started their project with a 3-D computer.

A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a ""Web ad appears"" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are.

According to the text in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang explains how the computer might work if the student doesn't like what he/she has in the computer and it says ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers can understand that, too."" It means that technology has developed, Dr. Paul Eckman and Dr. Huang created the FACS to see humans emotions, it has six basic as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The Doctors are showing that the new computers can see what it is in your mind because they improved the technology.

My conclusion is that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a good appications for a variety of industries because it is able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. The new technology has ""Empathy because it can feels someone else's emotions and can handle the complex algorithms. ",2,7,0.8658804297447205,2116
a5cc40d,"The FACS( Facial

Action Coding System) is a computer software that can scan the muslces of someones face and tell the emotions that person is feeling. The FACS seems like a very useless peice of software.

In the article, you read about how they used this software to ""decode"" the face of the Mona Lisa. The software was said to have worked and was able to tell the emotions she was feeling that very day. She was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Using this type of software on students in class will be useless and also a waste of time. Decoding the face of a student in class wont change anything in the class room. Paragraph six, line six, the author is telling how we can use the software to tell when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and is able to modify the lesson for the that student. Using this software would only be effeciant to those who learn on computers. A teacher could not use this software on a big class full of students because she would get differnt emotions from many different students. The teacher would not be able to give a lesson for just a couple of students in class based on the FACS

The FACS( Facial Action Coding System) would be useless for students. Online schooling could use this software but students in a class room would make the software useless          ",3,7,0.7975305318832397,1376

From this article we can see how this new technology finds emotion through a face as well as how that information looks once it's calculated. From this passage I feel that this technology is very useful and could help alot of people.

One of the many uses for this technology is that it has the ability to help others when they are bored or confused in a classroom. This technology can modify the lesson in order for the student to better convey the information needed. This helps students get a better understanding of the material while still learning in a way that fits that students prefrences. If this were to be in schools today I feel that it would help thoughs who may be failing not because they want to but because they aren't understanding the material.

This technology can also help adults as well wheather it would be for advertising ,for video game companies,or for video surgery. When it comes to advertising this technology can recognize the enjoyment or displeasure you may get out of an advertisment. Say you like it and smile, the computer may regognize this and continue to provide you with similar ads that fit what you like. As for the last two being about video games and video surgery these two can construct faces in a more exprssive way than it would without this technology.

This article shows just how useful this technology is and represents just how far technology has come since. This is an important resource that could help many with alot of things. As well as help teach those who are confused. And even to better advertise a product to someone. And for these reasons I feel that this technology is valuable.       ",3,7,0.8720138669013977,1778
c98f82e,"Have you ever wondered how the kids feel in class but they dont ever participate and/or express themselfs. Well this article about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is a great way to figure out some ways that some kids feel based on what they are learning. It is smart, unique, and valuable. These are the reason why the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea.

The Facial Action Coding System is smart because it allows you to see if the students are bored, interested, or just out of it during the lesson you teach. And you could also figure out different type of ways to manke a lesson or activity better that excites the children you are teaching to. In the article it states "" Most humans communication is nonverbal,including emotional communcation."" So this is basically saying that if we are not communicated with our mouths then what better way then communicating with facial expressions. This is why the Facial Coding System is smart.

It's is unquie because no-one has ever thought of this until now so the fact that teachers action care about how there students feel should touch some people. its also unique because it can tell the way your face is moving and the way your muscles move. In the articke it states that

""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face: all 44 major muscles in the model must move like the human muscles.""This just pushed to shove that if a computer can track all of your muscles in your face that that's pretty unique and different. And on top of that, they would pay that much money to make sure the kids have a good education is cool.

Lastly its valuable because if it's bettering the kids education and making a difference in their community, thats good. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" its says ""feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression. Whoever tought thta making faces could reveal so much about science of emotions."" This is why its valuable because it can tell us things that we might not know but the computer knows.

This is why the Making Mona Lisa Smile and the Facial Action Coding System is smart, unique, and valuable in so many ways. If you dont think that you should get the Facial Action Cosing System you might want to think twice if you really love your students.    ",3,7,0.7923930883407593,2334
587f42e,"Do you think that the use technology is valuable for detecting emotional expressions? well I think that it is not valuable for us. I will be naming some reason why in this essay. If you are intrested in knowing more of why it wouldn't be valuable for us please read on.

A reason that I think that this type of technology wouldn't be valuable to us because I don't think it is important to try to understand how someone feels or what emotions they are having at that moment. They probably wouldn't want you to know because if they did they would probably tell you. It's none of our business honestly, however how we be for sure that this type of technology would even work. There is supposed to be 44 major facial muscles in our face and the computer is supposed construct that using a 3-D model but what happenes if it misses a muscle and the calculations are all wrong. Then you wouldn't exactly know what they are really feeling. The computer would not be giving you the excat emotion.

Also, There is a mucle called orbiculars oculi pars palpabraeus that makes crow's feet around your eyes, so if computers scans someone's face that has that then the computer would give out false information about the person is feeling just because of the face when this person could really happy. Another muscle that is created is called the risorius that could put on a false smile that make your mouth skretch sideways creating a smile that could make you look happy when your actually sad. The computer could also scan a person like that and would again give false information. I believe that the computer can be wrong because everything won't be correct as they should be.

Another way, is that a person could just not smile at all like how Mona Lisa was once before and they could be extremly happy, but if a computer were to scan how that the computer would give results of sadness but that is not actually how the person is feeling. Computers just can't calculate how a person is feeling 100 percent of the time and be correct about it. Yes, a computer can communicate with humans but not emotionally. This is a new type technology can have it's ups and downs but I think that it will have more downs than ups.

However, another mucsle called frontalis pars lateralis could make you seem suprised just by raising an eyebrow but that doesn't always mean your confused or shocked it could mean many other things. The computer can calculate that your confused just by raising your eyebrow because it could calculate your face expressin not emotion. Facial expressions are universal and could all mean different things and a computer wouldn't clearly be able to tell how someone is feeling. Dr. Huang observed the artist da vinci for human anatomy to help paint mucsles precisely but his software only have similar anatomical information as electronic code, so his software doesn't the exact electronic codes it need so it could be wrong about how people are feeling.

To hence, I don't think that technology to read emotions are valuble because the computer could be wrong and not give the exact emotion, it could falsly give how someone is feeling due to a muscle in a persons face to make them look a certain way, and that the computer could not create the exact face because it mioght miss a muscle and give the wrong expression.

Being able to associate muscle movements throughout ournface with the true current emotion someone has seems to be impossible, by the Facial Actiom Coding System can attest to that. The Facial Action Coding System could revolutionize the way classrooms are run and impact schools in a great way by altering the way classes are run based on students emotions. It would be a great idea to have this system installed as a classroom computer because it could modify the lesson for students based on their understanding, teachers can detect the truth of students emotions about the class, and it can help students better their emotions or see for themselves how their emotions seem to be.

Having this facial expression reading system installed in classrooms can benefit many classes with better understandings. “Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor [based on the students emotions].” Detecting how students truly feel about the lesson could be a big help in how classrooms run. For instance, if the majority of the class is sensed to be confused about the lesson, teachers are then able to see that they need to spend more time on it or reevaluate how they are teaching the lesson and slow it down. If the computer senses that the class is bored, they may not learn as well if they don't care about what they are learning so the teacher could possibly change up the class with a game. Overall it could greatly benefit classes as a whole.

This computer can help teachers and they way they run the class and teach the lesson as well. Teachers could use this technology as a baseline for themselves to see how their classes react and feel about the way they run their class. “A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,” Dr. Huang predicts. This would greatly benefit students as well because no students want to tell their teachers that they hate the way their class is run and be honest with them. This would give teachers true insite about their class and would want to make it as beneficiary to students as possible. If teachers saw that students weren't enjoying their class they could altar it in some way to make it better for everyone.

This system being installed in classrooms could also help students see what their emotions look like and possibly make them better. If students knew what their emotions looked like outside of themselves, it could be a big eye opener for them to see what they may seem to be like and that they may not know themselves. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" If students saw how their emotions looked and they weren't good they could try to change them which studies show actually could change them by just having different facial expressions. This could help all students if they were mad or sad and it detected that, they could put a smile on their face which may actually help better their emotions.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a great idea to put into classrooms that could better everyone as a whole class as well as individually. It would be an amazing idea because it could modify the lesson for students based on their understanding, teachers can detect the truth of students emotions about the class, and it can help students better their emotions or see for themselves how their emotions seem to be. Every teacher would run their classroom to make it as beneficial to students as possible if they could and with this installed into classrooms, it could happen. The Facial Acting Coding System would change classrooms for the better and help teachers and students expedentially.",5,7,0.8604599237442017,3886
