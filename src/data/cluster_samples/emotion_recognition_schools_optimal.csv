126187d,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technoloy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The new software has been developed that imroves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The software is the lastest innovation from the Prof. Thomas Huang of illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam.

Dr. Huanga and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans. In the fact these humans can perform this same impressive ""calcutation"" every day. LIke you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. The Mona Lisa can really really bring back a smile to her face.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huamg predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Those were some of Dr. huang predicts. The computer can write some simple instructions that can make Mona Lisa smile with different emotions.

While looking in the mirror:

* Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth.

* Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the coners of your eyes

* Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes.

In the fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My conclusion, this new technology that Dr. Huamg is pretty amazing. This system or computer is a good thing it can make people smile and it can make Mona Lisa smile. It can also make the students smile or they can know what emotionl.  ",1
6c6ca59,"Ever wondered how your peers feel like but don't know, well now you do! Due to new technology by Dr. Paul Eckman, you can now tell how someone is feeling. But is this new technology useful? And is it reliable? Well let me inform you about it.

Is this new technology FACS (Facial Action Coding System) actually useful? Yes it is, what if ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", well as stated in paragraph 6, the computer ""... could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This technology could contribute to the teacher, in multiple ways.

Well according to Dr Eckman, he has programmed the system to classify ""six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" These six basic emotions are then ""associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". These muscles are Frontalis pars lateralis (above your eyes) which raise your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

Well now that you no about this new technology, you might be able to figure out how someone is feeling, just by the facial expressions that they show. And yes it is useful, and actually reliable.",2
bedf882,"Have you ever heard about the new technology called The Facial Action Coding System? What's the firts thing you think about when you hear about this? According to the acticle ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Facial Action Coding System is a new sotfware has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. We are gonna be talking about how the process begings and what methods they use to make this happen and possible

Firts, how this processstart to beings? The article state that, "" The process beings when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Dr. Paul Eckman was the creater of FACS (Facial Action Coding System).

What methods do they use to make this happen and possbile? Dr. Eckman classified the six basics motions-happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness but he associated each characteristics with the movements of the facial muscles. For example, "" your frontails pairs lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"". According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help to produce them. This progrma can not only drescribe your emotions, it also shows when you ae hidding you emotion and when you do a fake smile. For example,"" intructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular actions units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""

In conclusion, the FACS use diiferents many ways to make this experiment to be possible and how this program being to funtion. This program is a good way to recognize how technoly has been imporving and what computers can do. Now with this information and knowing how this program works would you want to try this program and see if this its works? If you do would be a good idea     ",2
df1d356,"Facial coding is cool, but it is not valuable in a school setting. Why would one ever need this at their school. Students do not go school to get their emotions checked, they go to learn about history stuff or about anything else. Also we do not know if this computer will truly work on a human because they only talk about attemping it on a painting not a live physical humans. Also how can one produce something so complex that a PC can not even keep up with it. To one it might might be cool, but in reality it is not that interesting for school use.

Why use a computer? Using a computer to find people's emotion is uneccessary because Alto mentions the brain does this calculation everyday with even more acurracy and it will help build comunication skills and put oneself on a deeper level of thought. There is a person that this boy likes or has a crush on and he wants to talk to her, but he doesn't know what to say. Later he notices that she is obviously down about something, and he walks over to her and says ""Hey, are you alright you look kinda down?"" This is the skills we need to work on we need to not rely on computersand learn to read emotions.

While people agree and disagree with this idea the opposition has some good points. If there is kid that has been mentally abused or is depressed. Having this imagery can really help get students to open up and talk about it, so they can prevent what is happening. Another thing it can do is help depict the mood of a painting like previously stated in this article by D'Alto. Also it could help teachers more on understanding their students so they can buils a more positive and stable relationship. By knowing what people are feeling it could effect the mental state of the mind and body and not cause stress.

Overall the effect to this product would be not having the ability to actually depict how one is feeling without using the coding system which could make human intereaction almost artificial. Later on down the road this could be useful, but as it is today it's not the greatest idea for a school atomosphere, especially with the distraction of social media and technology in general. ",3
4779250,"Imagine being able to detect someones emotions? First, how does this new technology work. Second, the values it has in the schools. Third, it can make it easier detect someones emotions. This is why technology that reads emotions can be very useful.

First, how would the new technology detect the emotions? The Facial Action Coding System is how. This innovation was created by Dr. Paul Eckman. The process starts with the computer constructing 3-D model of faces. It also, models the 44 major muscles that have to move like humans. By using video imagery, the software tracks the facial movement to recognize the emotions.

Second, the effects it has on the school could be outstanding. What if the school computers could tell a student's emotions? The computer could recognize if the student is bored or confused. The computer could modify what the student is learning to something more effective. This way would be easier on the teacher, so they won't have to come up with new lesson plans.

Third, it can easily detect someones emotions. They have used the new technology on Leonardo da Vinci panting of Mona Lisa. In the painting it's kind of hard to tell her emotions. The new technology find she's 83%, happy 9% disguted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. If this technology can detect a painting emotions like this easily, just imagine how easy it would be to detect on a human.

In Conclusion, technology that reads emotions can be very useful. First, how it's uesd. second, the value it has in schools. Third,it can make it easier to detect someones emotion.",3
35fea99,"Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a computer technology that read the emotional expressions of students. The technology show be in classroom because how would we know if something wrong with a students if she does not show it or tell it. Many students do not show there feeling in school because the are afriad. Especially around there frined because the dont want there friends to see there emotional side of them. FACS should be in classroom because we need to know how if you and a good or bad mood, counselor, and if your getting bully and your not happy about it.

Classroms should have the Facial Action Coding System so the teacher can know if you are in a good or bad mood because some people dont show it. Teachers need to know how their students are feeling because they might call on them in class to answer a qusetion not knowing that the student is in a bad to answer the quwstion. In the text it states,"" Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This quote support my answer because its hard to tell if a person upset or need time to be alone so he or she can cool down. Having a FACS computer in classroom will really help teahers know if there something upsetting there students.

Having a Facial Action Coding System in classrom would help conselor know if you go to there office and your not showing no emotion but your upset about something. The technogly can be helpful to many school because teachers do not know whats going on with there students because they dont show it or try to talk to somebody about it. In the text it states,""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitae another person's facial epressions. Whoever thought that amking faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!."" This quote support my answer because it can show how your real feeling behind their smile.

This technogly could help students that are getting bully and are afriad to speak up and tell a teacher. Students that get bully everyday at school are most likely do not tell nobody that they are getting bully because they are afriad of the person that are doing the mean things to the student. Having the Facial Action Coding System can help the student that getting bully seek out help before it gets worse then it already is. In the text it states,""But in a false smile, the mout is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. to an expect, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are something used to spot when a ""smiling"" politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This quote supports my quote because it can help a teacher know if her or his student is upset about something and he or she can ask the student so it he be stop.

Facial Action Coding System should be in school because it can be helpful for teachers to know if your in a good or bad mood , letting your counsoler if you upset about something, and also if your getting bully. This technolgy is a great way to know if something going on at home. Many student would proabbly ant this kind of computer because they would be scared to tell somebody how they are feeling. Students are not just going to be emotional in front of there classmate because when there friend ask whats wrong with them it make it harder to tell somebody how your feeling. School should have this computer in there school because its a great way to know if a student is upset.",4
