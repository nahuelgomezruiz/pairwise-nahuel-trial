The face on mars is probly from the wilnd or somethink hiting it and it makes the face looking. According to the text they think it is a rale face or somthing. They tock pictersh frome the sadlight stachon in space. There are scientests studing that today.

What i think it was from a rock hiting it and it made the fac or it had a wind storme and it made that face. According to the text they think it was frome there rockets landing there. Many people have there own apionyons. People say someone made it to show they where there and did not tell any one so they have something to talk about and to descuver what hapened.

People wonts to know how the face got on mars. Many people dont like the way we are finding a face on mars. There are many things people wont to know about the face on mars and i think it is from wind or a big rock but thats me.

This is what i think about the face on mars. I had many questons runing throw my mind about the face on mars. One of the qustons i had going throw my mide is how would they see it on mars or if they where on mars and sall it mack a face.         ",1,1,0.8037666082382202
3e1faa5,"Not one human has ever seen a living species in Mars or in any planet. In 1976 an odd feature appeared on Mars. Many people think that it looks like a human face. These people believe that the odd feature could be an alien living on Mars.

The news has been spreading around that the ""face on Mars"" is a creature living in space. I don't believe that aliens are real. Aliens are a figure that someone made up a long time ago hoping that their were more people in the Universe. I know this because if there were aliens in the Universe, someone probably would have already found one.

A lot of odd objects float around in space. The face that people are seeing could just be a meteor. Meteors float around the Universe just trying to make problems. The meteor could have blasted into Mars and created the face like feature. Things like this are not very rare. Meteors have rocketed into Earth a great number of times.

I also believe in Jesus. I believe in every single detail the Bible says. The face could be Jesus showing people that he is watching us. Everything in the Bible has either already happend or will happen in the future. Aliens are not in the Bible, therefore, I don't believe they exist.

If aliens really do exist we would have already found one. Humans have thought aliens are real for hundreds of years. The object could be a natural object like a meteor. Meteors pass through the Universe every single day. What makes this object different? Nothing make the object different. Jesus Christ has all of the creatures we need to know about in the Bible. Aliens are just not one of them.                  ",1,1,0.7084730863571167
769f7db,"Although Scientist believed that the face was an alian artifact, i dont believe so, maybe it was just a wierd shape on mars they had saw, and assumed it was an alian,it could have just been how mars looked from where they were, or how it just looks in general. perhaps it was just a natural landform on mars, i think so. after more researching, comes to find out it was actually a natrual landform on mars, scientists are not always right, 50% of the time they are false, an the other 50% of the time the are positive. i think people were just wanting it to be a alian, so scientists did all this research, to find out and see what it was.

when scientist decribed this face they seen on mars, ""A shadowy likeness of a human face"" ""an enormous head"" ""Was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called -Cydonia"", yes it does sound like it would be an alian based on how theyre decribing it, but wouldnt you think it could be anything other then an alian?, i think so, not everything with a shadowy like figure of a human has to be an alian, it could be anything really. Like just some natrual figure on mars. therefor this was not an allian artifact on mars, turns out it was just some natrual figure on mars.",2,1,0.825382649898529
3a97cf5,"The Face is just a natural landform. It happened 25 years ago. You can say its from aliens but it is not an alien! Iv'e seen pictures of Face. From reshearch only robots walked on Mars. Aliens are not even real. There are camras om thoes robots so they would know if they seen anything. Have you ever got a warning that an alien invation was about to occur?

I think that some dust and rocks made this shape occur. Scientist have thier studies. My question is how did this alien form this pop up form. If u say it was a alien does it live under the dust. I don't think so,because it adventually is going to die. This is nonsense to belive that aliens walked on Mars and formed a type of shape. It is just a natural form.

Why do you think this is an alien. One reason they would is because of it's shape. Do you have any evidence to prove to that this is an aliens shape. They probably would say no,because I do not see any antenas. That is a big hint to tell if that was an alien or not.

Were's the body all you can see is a face so why assum it's an alien. Perfect good sense would tell you aliens aren't real. It's just a from that was created by natual resources on the planet. Use your research and don't go believing anything crazy. Such,as aliens living on Mars with just a head. I mean use common sense. What do you physically see on an alien. A big head,antena's,body,and wierd looking feet.

This is not an alien people it is just a from that was created by natural resources. So don't go believing nothing foolish that we have aliens roaming different planets. Tust in NASA the greatest of all. Don't believe anyone who isn't and professional lke use.

3402605,"Hello, my name is Lisa, and i'm a scientist here at NASA. I have heard that you claim that aliens have created this landform we found on Mars.

There has not been any life found on Mars at this momment. It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.

aca3239,"We humans have been trying to discover aliens for more than a million years. Why have we not found them yet? We have been up in space multiple times and we have had yet another more multipe times sent space robots that went into orbital. So ask your self this question why have we not found aliens yet?

I think due to evidence that it is a natural landform. I think it is a natural landform because in paragraph one it states that ""...when it spotted the shadowly likeness of a human face."" When I read this I then concluded that it only really looked like a human because of the shadows that make up the ""eyes, nose and mouth"" in which makes this rock figure looking as if it has a face. I do think that is a natural rock landform because God created the earth so that only people would live on earth. Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. Another example of why that the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform is because it states in the text on paragraph seven that ""There was no alien monument after all."" This is poroving that even scienctists have conculuded that there was no landform on mars. Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to ""face landform"". Though due to the pixalation i think that it did not look like a face anymore. The scientists should have put each photo in the same pixilation because it would have been an accurate demonstration over the years and how this rock landform has formed.

Based on the evidence from the article and my past knowleadge I have conculded that this rock landform is in fact a natural landform that aliens have not created/ made this face looking landform. So what do you think?",3,1,0.7827661037445068

Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.

Out of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a ""human"" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.

To conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.

First,The Face that is on Mars is just a natural landform because over the years NASA has been taking pictures of the Face and the more pictures that NASA took the Face did not look like a Face anymore, it looked like a natural landform that was on Mars.

Next, many scientists who saw the Martian Face that is on Mars,figured that it was just a Martian mesa that resembled a human head which was formed by shadows giving the illusion of the human eyes, nose, and mouth. Authors reasoned that the image would be a good way to engage the public to attract their attention towards them knowing more about Mars.

Finally, a few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact and sent the Mars Global Surveyor to the Red Planet.

40d1fe4,"This ""face marking"" on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientist discovered Mars many years ago and they did not see no signs of life on this planet or this face was not see on this planet. How can a ""face"" just natural appear of Mars when no one is on there?

Why would NASA hide a big discovery of something like this to the people. If NASA found out or new there were any signs of life on Mars, I would expect there to be a newcast of that or somehting else in that matter.

Some Scientist believe that it is alien made structure, but other scientist believe it is just a land formation. It is just a land formation because, shadows are making up its nose, eyes, and mouth. Others believe it is a butte or a mesa, which are land formations around the American West. The image of the ""face"" looks just like a hill or rounded very small mountaion top. The ""face"" even has changed over the years. Many things change by erosion or the weather,so i believe it is just a mesa that has changed over the years. The markings were not hidden by some kind of an ""alien haze"" it was simply the weather. Planets other than earth have diferent kind of weathers also. There is something in the United States that is simulaur to the ""face"", it is a small lava doom and it is the same height as the ""face"".

Scientist believed that there is somekind of an alien face on Mars, but there isnt it is just a mesa or a butte. Which is a small landmass. If there was an ancient civilization or still life on Mars, we would be able to see it, unless they are just great at hinding. Even if there were civilzations on Mars wouldn't we be able to see more artifacts? The land mass has also changed in the pass years, probably by ersion or wether. There is also shadows that are reflectind over the land mass, to show its distinct characterristics, like the nose, mouth, and eyes. ",3,1,0.8882213830947876
4b920ac,"In 1976, the Viking 1 set course to mars. When the Viking 1 was orbiting mars, the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. It looked like a shadowy human face. The question everyone is asking is who are what made this? Was it aliens or is it just natural. If you ask me, this strange looking thing is just a natural landform.

I think it is a landform for a couple of reasons. My first reason is that only a few of my friends from NASA believe that this strange landform was really made by aliens. I also think that this is just a landform because the photo that we took was not very clear and that could have made the landform look like a face.

I also think that this is just a land form because the time of year that we took the one of the photos. When we took the photo in 1998, we took the photo during the winter on Mars and it made Mars sort of cloudy and the Mars Global Surveyer had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the strange landform. Some of my friends from NASA were saying that some of the so called ""alien markings"" were hidden too.

My final reason for thinking that this is just a landform is that when we took the thre pictures and compared them, they all looked different from each other. The picture we took in 1976 looked like the face the most out of the three pictures. The picture we took in 1998 did not have the same details of the first picture and it did not look like a face. The picture we took in 2001 did not have the facial features of the first photo either. Therefore, I think this is just a landform

In conclusion, I think this is just a landform because only a few of my friends believed that it was done by aliens, the photo we took in 1998 was different due to some of the factors of weather, and all three photos looked different from one another.      ",3,1,0.8162199258804321
45076e3,"""So, if you're a NASA scientist, you should be able to tell me the whole story about the Face On Mars, which obviously is evidence that there is life on Mars, and that the face was created by aliens, correct?"" No, twenty five years ago, our Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did.

The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought the natural landform was evidence of life on Mars, and that us scientists wanted to hide it, but really, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. We decided to take another shot just to make sure we weren't wrong, on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, revealing a natural landform, which meant no alien monument. ""But that picture wasn't very clear at all, which could mean alien markings were hidden by haze"" Well no, yes that rumor started, but to prove them wrong on April 8, 2001 we decided to take another picture, making sure it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's team captured an amazing photo using the camera's absolute maximum revolution. With this camera you can discern things in a digital image, 3 times bigger than the pixel size which means if there were any signs of life, you could easily see what they were. What the picture showed was the butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.

""But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?"" You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it? If you still don't believe the evidence the pictures are out for you to see, which obviously shows a natural landform. The reason to not believe these movies and magazines is because they ignore the research. They make up things to get the people going, but what they actually should do is pay attention to us, because we have very important findings every single day. ",3,1,0.9249430298805236
0728321,"The Aliens on Mars

In the text Unmasking the Face on Mars NASA says that there was a face.Then they went back eighteen years later.Then another three years and said it was a natural landform.I also think that it is a natural landform because there isn't really aliens or anything other living thing on mars.Some people would there are lifeforms on Mars because of water which is ridiculous.There could be clouds and water on a planet without a lifeform. In these next few paragraphs i will tell you why it is a natural landform.

One reason that the so called face is only a landform is because it could've been a rock formation.There could be rocks in the shape of a head because of other rocks and erosion.And how the got the eyes?...shadows.Shadows could've been a be part of this because its a planet pretty close to the sun.So from which way the Viking 1 was facing there could've been shadows.

Second reason is on April 5,1998 when they went to mars again with Mars Global Surveyor...while thousands of anxious web surfurs were waiting the image JPL wedsite revealed it as a natural landform. People were upset so they said since it was a cloudy haze there could still be a face.Which made it worse because people actually believed that.

Third reason is if there was a face form on earth and no one would freak out by it because there is actual humans on earth.So if there were aliens everyone would freak.Am I right?So if there were real aliens you wouldnt know what they actually look like but you do know from evidence from ""actual pictures"" that people supposedly took.

Some people think its the other way around.Some people who aren't like me actually believe in aliens.They think since in 2001 they sent a better camera on a ""cloudless"" day that there were Martians.And since they have the camera whith better pixels they could see more clearly...so clearly that you could've have seen Egyptian style pyramids or even a small shack which was almost impossible in the Viking 1.

To conclude, I think that the face was a natural landform made by erosion.It would most likely to be impossible for it to be a martian, not saying it is but I highly doubt there would be martians.",4,1,0.8349205851554871
1a0ff6e,"People believe that this natural landform that looks like a face on mars was done by aliens. Well it wasn't. If it was aliens we would tell you because it would be a benefit for us. People on earth see natural landforms that look like certian things all the time. Not to mention it looked like such a face because the shadows that it casted made it more detailed.

If it was aliens it would benefit us. Like the text states, ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars."" But its not. The text comes back afeterwards and says ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars."" If it was an ancient alien statue we would say it and back it up, because it would have a highly strong benefit towards NASA because we could get donations for it. Along with more popularity.

Not only would it benefit us, but it looks like natural landforms all across the world. The text even states, """"It reminds me most ofMiddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."""" Not only that but it mentions, """"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the face on mars.""""

Why not ask questions about landforms that look detailed or look like aliens may have done it on earth?

The main reason the face looked the way that it did was because of the shadows that it casted. The text tells us, ""Shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The text also tells us, ""Because of its face like structure it become a great attraction. Starring in films, books, magazines and other articles."" If it weren't for the shaddows then what was the point.

What if NASA is lying? What if none of this is true? WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BELIEVE US? People should believe NASA because again this all would benefit NASA. The text even states, ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars."" Not to mention, if it was a sign of human life it would show a dramatic increase of popularity.

So no it isn't an alien statue, or a sign of ancient alien civilization. If it was we would tell you so we could have a benefit or major profit. On Earth we have natural landforms all around that look like actual things made by aliens. Why not question them about those natural landforms? Not only that, the only real reason it looked like a face was because the shadows it casted made it look like it had a mouth, eyes, nose, and other facial features. And we're not lying because it would benefit us. ",4,1,0.8343369960784912
151a470,"Do you ever wonder if the face on mars is just a landform? I've thought about it and I have read this story called ""Unmasking The Face on Mars"" this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.

When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption ""...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth."" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This ""face"" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.

Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head..."" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage ""It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.

Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that ""the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.""(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.

After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars"" is just a landform. I've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true. Therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all. ",4,1,0.8652260303497314
d1568dc,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" the author writes about a mesa on the surface of the planet Mars. This particular mesa recieved a lot of attention because the shadows resmbled a human face. Many conspiracy theorist believe this means there is alien life on Mars, but they are incorrect. The ""Face"" on Mars in simply an ordinary mesa.

The original picture of the ""Face"" was captured in 1976. Since that time ouR camera have improved, allowing us to see images more clearly. The original image was blurry and indistinct, leading may people to believe that the mesa was evidence of alien life on Mars. Again when the second picture was taken in 1998 camera were improving, but not as efficient as the camera used to take the final picture. Also in 1998 the picture was taken on a cloudy day, obscuring the mesa behind clouds. The 2001 picture clearly shows an ordianry Martian mesa, not a ""Face"".

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!""(Garvin, Mars global surveyor). If there was any sign of alien life, activity, or even past activity NASA would be able to see it in the 2001 picture of the ""Face"". However the picture clearly shows an empty mesa. This

Martian mesa can even be compared to an ordianry Earth mesa!

This mesa attracted a lot of attention from the media because of the way the shadows fell across the mesa, creating a face-like illusion. NASA captioned the original photo ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors wanted to engage the public and they definetly did! While many people believed the shadows created the image of a face, NASA clearly stated in the original caption of the 1976 photograph that it was simply an illusion caused by the shadows.

The ""Face"" is not really a face at all. It is a huge rock formation/mesa, similar to many other mesas on Mars. The only thing that made this particular mesa any different from every other mesa on the surface of Mars was the coincedincial way the shadows fell across it. Many people thought this ""Face"" was evidence of life on the surface of Mars, but the are wrong. This is because the picture would show signs of life or activity, but there were none. So, in conclusion the ""Face"" is not and never was an ancient alien monument.        ",4,1,0.8544778823852539
6bf18d4,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a landform seen in photographs of the surface of Mars. Some people believe that this landform is proof that alien life exists and that this landform was created by said aliens. However, there is plenty of information to disprove this. This information is found in the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars.""

The article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" states, ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say some conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This statement suggests that NASA would have no reason to hide evidence of alien life, as this would benefit NASA greatly. If NASA had discovered evidence of alien life, NASA would have presented it as such.

Later on, photographs were taken of the landform once again. However, the camera had to ""peer through whispy clouds to see the Face."" Because of this, some skeptics believed that alien markings were hidden by the haze, which is shown in the quote, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by the haze."" In response to this, another picture was taken on a cloudless day, showing that the Face was nothing more than a natural land form.

This landform is similar to some of the landforms on Earth, as shown by the quote, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Another quote to prove that the Face is similar to formations on Earth is, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This suggests that the Face could have been formed much in the same way as the Earth formation mentioned in the quote.

The fact that, in the photographs of the fornation, there is no evidence to prove alien life is also a factor to consider. A quote by Garvin shows why this is an important peice of information to consider. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were any objets in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This proves that because no evidence of alien life can be seen in the pictures, means that there is none. In these pictures, claims Garvin, you could discern objects easily and tell what they are. If so, NASA can easily confirm that this land formation is natural and that there is no evidence of alien life.

Thus, the Face on Mars is a natural land formation. If it was evidence of alien life, NASA would have presented the information as such. NASA would have then pursued the lead that proved alien life exsisted by attempting to find this alien life or more evidence to prove that alien life exsisted. NASA would have beneiftted greatly if the Face had been created by alien life forms. This formation is also very similar to some land formations found on Earth. If such formations are found natrually on Earth, could they not also be found naturally on other planets? This land formation on Mars is natrual, as similar land formations are found naturally on Earth and NASA finding proof of alien life would have benefitted them greatly. If these things are true, then the Face on Mars is a land form that occurred naturally, and we, the people of Earth, have yet to find evidence that alien life exsists in our univserse.

Twenty-five years before 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a landform in the shape of a face on Mars's surface. This, after being released to the media, caused an uprising of speculations. Did aliens make this? Were there other beings on other planets? Are we not alone?

A famous scientist once said that we researched for other life on other planets because humans didn't want to be alone in this vast galaxy. He also said that it could cause either fear or excitement. The media wanted to grab the attention of the common people, and to do that they needed something extraordinary. The media spins the truth to benefit their needs. You can't believe everything they say because all they can do is gain by your speculation.

NASA hardly thought this was the work of aliens. They didn't want the people to think they were lying, they wanted to seek the truth. Even if they were hiding something, they could only ever lose everything for covering it up. More attention on the dying out NASA program would gain the support and money to fund them. So, on April 5, 1998, they sent another spacecraft to take pictures of the landform.

Not everyone thought the image that came up, the one of a landform, sufficed. They argued that it was probably too hazy and that the image wasn't a reliable resource. They said that the haze was blocking the alien markings.

Again, NASA sent another spacecraft in 2001 to take better pictures in different angles. The picture showed a landform much like a butte or mesa here on Earth. Some people stated that it was a conspiracy.

Mars has unique quirks like every planet. Here on earth we have natural landforms such as a mesa, and mountains, and rivers. Mars isn't much different.

Scientists have special catogories for classifying a planet, and Pluto did not meet those requirements. So, every planet has to have at least one thing in common with another. Just beacause Mars is a different planet, doesn't mean that it can't have landforms much like those on Earth.

To say that one planet has aliens because of a landform, is to say that we are aliens as well. Don't we have mountains? Yes, you might say, but it's because of tectonic plates pushing against each other. Science has taught us many things, so now we know something foreign to people back then.

Take Christopher Columbus as in example. Before he sailed the ocean, everyone thought that the earth was flat. After he disproved the theory, people saw the earth for what it was: a round, water planet. Another great example would be Galileo, who disproved the theory that Earth was the center of the galaxy and the sun and everything else rotated around it. People had to have curiosity, and the willpower to go on with these expeditions. After they disproved a theory, it made more sense, and the world around us just is. Now, we don't question on how the mountains were made. We don't question on why we have day and night.

We are more educated now, but there are still things we haven't learned. That's why people should have a more open mind about finding the truth. Once we find the truth, we'll move on to bigger things and so on and so on. This mystery is one which piques people's interest, but turning to myth and false facts isn't the way to go. Exploring and learning from new innovations is what makes scientists who they are. They took the time to go through the process of being a certified scientist. To say you are smarter than one is disrespectful towards them, saying all their hard work was worth nothing.

So, to summarize, aliens did not make the landform on Mars. It was a natural occurence that got blown up into bigger proportions because the media wanted to satisfy their own needs to get profit. NASA knows what they are saying, and we should respect their statements until we ,for sure, know ourselves that the statement is false.          ",5,1,0.6384688019752502
0f789a2,"There are many controversial ideas about what was seen in the picture on Cydonia. Some belive it was from alien life form some do not. I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens. I say this because we have pictures proving so, landforms are known to form in odd ways, and we have double checked and there were no signs of alien life forms.

The ""Face"" was not created by aliens because we have pictures proving so. In the article ""Unmasking The Face Of Mars"" they said that when they first saw a picture of this mysterious face is was the year 1976. A lot of changes were being made that year, it was the peak of technology for Americans and we were bound to go on in our experiments. it states in the article that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photo."" And in return it was a natural landform. But people were still not satisfied. They claimed that the picture was taken at a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet so they tried again as stated in the passage, "" Nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"" and the results were as followed, "" Marlins team captured an extroardinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution"" the results still came back as a lanform.

I do not believe that the "" Face "" was created by aliens because landfroms are known to form in odd ways. For example in the article it states that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the american west."" They claimed this after taking the picture April 8, 2001. The picture simply shows ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" as said in the article. How many times when we were all children did we think we saw someone when it was just a shadow? plenty of times and in this instance it is exactly the same.

And lastly I do not believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was created by alien life form because we have double checked and checked again and we did not find signs of any form of life on Mars. It said in the article that they took a picture in 1976, then they were astonished so they checked again in 1998, and then when people were still not satisfied they checked agin in 2001. It sates in the article that ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""

and not only that but, "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.

However though, it states in the article that "" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars"" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that "" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that "" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the ""conspiracy theorists"" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.

To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars. I think that the information that i have presented you with would go to show and prove my theory right. ",6,1,0.869957685470581
