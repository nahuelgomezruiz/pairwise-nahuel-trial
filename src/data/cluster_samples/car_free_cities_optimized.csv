fc76be4,"germany,paris,columbia and now the usa have begun to cut back ob their vehichle emmissions. why?

To reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced by their countries.

no cars in germany? vaubaun germany is a new upscale community on the edge of the french and swiss border. recently completed in 2006 whats so special you might ask?

theres little no no cars in this new community.

according to the article ""

in german suburb, life goes on with out cars

"" written by: elisabeth rosenthanl.

""70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""

thsi effort is being used to try and reduce the 12 pecent of green house gas prouced by europ alone.

in vauban people crowd the sidwalks, kis playing in the streets, and the people that do want to own a car have to pay a cool $40,000.00. and there cars are not even kept in their houses.

in another european country close by, paris is also trying to cut down its green house gas emisoms.

in the article ""

paris bans driving due to smog

"" it tells how france is also taking action to reduce its green house gases.

the article reads ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforces a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

anyone who had an odd numberd tag on one of the days and was cought driving would  get a $31 ticket. and revers for the even numberd tags on the next day. so the cars took turns driving. meaning there would be less cars on the street on those certain days.

according to the article over 4,000 people were fined, and 27 people had their cars impounded. it might sound stupid but whe your trying to save the world its a small price to pay.

bogota columbia also joins the fight against greenhouse gases.

""

car free day spinning into a big hit in bogota

"" by Andrew selsky tells the story of just one day that people in bogota neglected to use cars.

"" millions of colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. it was the third straight year cars have been banned and taxis permitted for the days without cars in this capital city of 7 million. the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violators faced $25 fines.""

bogota columbia has been doing this now for over 3 years, meaning that they are actually cutting down on there green house gas emissions.

not even the rainly days of columbia stopped the participants of this now yearly event. the participants are not only held to bogota, recently cali and valledupar also joined the even.

this 1 day with out cars has been in place sinc the 1990's.

the article ""

the end of car culture

"" tells how americans are driving less and how less and less people are buying cars, and how les greenhouse gas is being emmitioned.

lastly its tells how president obama gave a speach on greenhouse gases.            ",1,0,0.7410818934440613,2934
eee008f,"Cars are a very large help for transportation. Although they do have alot of defects to our environment, our laziness, and our safety.

The first reason we should limit car use is so our environment doesn't get ruined.  The fumes our vehicles are relasing into the air are creating a large addition to the greeenhouse gases.  For an example semis, diesel cars, diesel trucks and other vehicles when you rev the gas it pours out black smoke into the environment.  When you see a truck do this you think nothing of it, but overtime and with every single car and truck that does it, it adds up very quickley.

Another reason we should limit our car usuage is because it increases our laziness.  Instead of driving to school when it's only 2 minutes away, you could just walk.  If you walked you would lose a little weight and even saving your gas money.  If you are close to the place you want to go then you might as well just walk in benfits you in many ways.  Saving money, losing weight, and getting more fit.

One of the most important reasons we should limit our car usuage is for our own safety.  Deaths in car accidents is one of the most leading causes to death now a days. would you rather walk or ride a bike to the location you want to go or would you rather risk your life by driving and somebody teboning you and injuring or even killing you.  Not that you should but some people sometimes can get into a crash with you and then just drive off. Whether it was your fault or theirs now you have to pay for the damages done to your vehicle.

If you are going to drive because you live far away from everything.  Simply car pull, it's alot easier and if everyone throws down a little money then you aren't spending that much on gas or diesel.  Riding a bike is a great solution to limiting car usuage because it's a one time purchase, once you buy the bike you don't have to pay for fuel.  Also it's better than walking because it's by far faster.

In general driving has advantages and disadvantages.  Although if you are close to your location then riding a bike would be ideal to lower car usuage.    ",2,0,0.7981201410293579,2112

For example, limiting car use can lead to a cleaner environment, better overall health of the people and the Earth, and overall, just a better place to live. Cutting down on car usage can be very benficial for the planet, along with future generations of people.

First, limiting car use can lead to a better place to live in. If we were to slow down on the use of gas, there would be less wars over oil in other countries. We as a race can change the world, one car at a time. Lowering the amount of driving wouldn't be an easy change, but surely one worth while.

Secondly, giving up cars completely might not be necessary, but emitting toxic gas fumes can be easily avoided simply by switching to an electric car. There are many affordable electric cars that can help stop the fumes from traveling into the ozone layer, which can prolong our Earth's life, our lives, and can stop global warming dead in its tracks. Who doesn't want to keep this wonderful weather?

Lastly, cutting down on driving automobiles might have an effect  on saving people from car accidents caused by unfit drivers. Thousands of people die every day from unnecessary car usage. If we were to cut the amount of driving in half, the rate of death due to car accidents would find a steep decline.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can make the world a better place. This decision can lead to better health, less death due to car accidents, prolonging our planet's health, and less complaints about those roller-coaster like gas prices! It only takes one person to make a change, so decide if you want to be the one to potentially save the world.    ",3,0,0.7909018397331238,1689

In several places around the world citizens are cutting down, or off,with their car usage  and starting to transport themselves by bycicle or walking.  Vauban, Paris and Bogota residents have described this new way of living as stress-reducing and has also been a domino effect for places around the world!

The first point, described by previous car owners in Vauban, Germany is the lack of stress in their life after the conversion to a no-car lifestyle. ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Citizen Heidrun Walter described the change as positive even while juggling her full-time jobs of being a media trainer and mom.  The loss of time spent in traffic has produced a more relaxed lifestyle in Bogota, Colombia as well.  Carlos Arturo Plaza, citizen, explains that the switch as ""A good opportunity to take away stress."" As a whole, nobody likes to sit in traffic and walking or riding a bicycle to work makes one less thing you have to worry about.

Having citizens convert into not using automobiles full time also produces the domino effect. For example, because of Bogota using this lifestyle the Colobian cities of Cali and Valledupar have followed in their lead. As well as the obvious that this change brings, is also is shedding off on other places that want to improve their surroundings.  With other cities, countys or even countries joining in, we can slowly make the world a healthier place.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has brought positive effects on the cities of Vauban, Paris and Bogota. These places have shown signs of lower stress and an easier way of life.  Many other places have been adding on to the trend and can make the world a much less polluted and better place to be.                                            ",3,0,0.7051433324813843,1943
fb35b95,"Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usuage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by. There are many advantages to cities being able to control the amount of cars being used everyday. Advantages such as, less pollution in the enviroment by creating less smog, making the cities and roads a lot safer, by lowering the risk of getting into or even causing a wreck, or even something as simple as making your life, and the lives around you much more peaceful.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. (paragraph 5)"" Cars are the number one cause of pollution in most cities, espcially ones that have large amounts of drivers on the road in a single day. The author of source one, states in pargraph 8 that ""..some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like not only in developed countries, but also in the developing world, where emissons from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""  All authors state that limiting car usage, is a great way to reduce air pollution. Paragraph 10, of source two, states that ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" If car usuage was limited in cities there would be less smog, and pollution in the air. Not only would it be better for the enviroment, it would also be better for your health.

Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving wrecklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.

Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing; less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, ""...in attempts to make suburbs more compact..."" Source one, also states that ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway. (paragraph 6)"" Getting to these places will become safer for everyone.

As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful enviroment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.             ",4,0,0.8224649429321289,3481
a22d402,"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city and/or regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a time-consuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almost-broken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semi-trucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashes/accidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bike-sharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridge/tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our number-one priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work; taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds; or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it's not the destination that yiou should look forward to; it's the journey.    ",5,0,0.80524742603302,6972
