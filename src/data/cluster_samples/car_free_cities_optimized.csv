Imagine walking out into a world of smoke, dust, and fog; finding oranisms exstinct or hiding. This is a glimspe of our future. If we do not conrol car usage in our days today this is what it will come to. Limiting car usage has a plethora of advantages.

In Vauban, Germany, past car owners have given up their veihicles for a better life. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' sad Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the clatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.""(

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""

by Elizabeth Rosenthal Paragraph 3 Lines 20 through 25). Many people have given up their cars and homes to move to this upscale communtity. It is an example of a trend to separate suburban life and auto use.

There are efforts going on right now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Twelve percent of those emissions are from passenger cars and up to fifty percent in car-intensive areas in the United States.

According to the article

""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog""

, Paris, France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city after days of a near-record pollution. People who were motorists or drove licensed cars were ordered to not drive or they were to pay a fine of $31(22-euro fine). This did not stop most of the people however, because four thousand drivers were find, and 27 of them had their cars impounded for how they reacted upon this.

Paris typically has more smog. Having limited car usage enabled the congestion(car traffic) to go down 60 percent in Paris. Even though after this enforcement of the driving ban made delivery companies coplain of lost revenue, there were agreements for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passangers.

Imagine walking outside to the fresh air while feeling a rose petal on a near-by bush and watching a squirell and blue jay up in the trees. The neighbors are getting on their bike to the lake across town. All is happy and clean. This was due to limiting car usage in not just Paris and Vauban, but everywhere.                    ",2,0,0.8973255157470703,0.0,14.285714285714285,14.285714285714285

Did you know that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""? Imagine how low those percentages would be if we stoped using cars. For the past years there has been efforts to try and make citites denser and better for walking. This would not only be good for our environment and ecosystem but also for ourselves. We could use the fresh air and excercise.

""In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""Car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Many experts expect public tranport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be approved this year."" ""In pervious bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" In Paris, after an intense near-record of polution, they enforced a partial driving ban to try and clear the air of bad gasses. After a few days of doing so, they noticed that car traffic had lowered 60 percent after several days of intensifying smog. In BOGOTA, Colombia, they they created a program that's set to spread to other countries in hope for them to do the same and had a car-free day. Millions of Colombians participated and did everything possible to avoid traffic jams and leave the street empty. Their goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

5760f67,"Fellow citizens all over the world. Cars are not nessisary. There are a bunch of great reasons why limiting car usage has its advantages. A couple of reasond are that it's good for the environment, you will save a bunch of money, more exersize and less acidents.

If citizens limited their car usage, it would be a whole lot better for the environment. Driving everywhere in your car wastes gas and that goes into the air that we breathe. It is not good what cars are doing to the air. They are poluting our air, trees cannot convert it to oxygen. We are stuck with the gas that come from the cars in the air.

You will save a great amount of money by not spending it on gas to drive everywhere. Gas is not cheap and wont last forever. Its about $3.00 a gallon sometimes even more than that. If you save your money and not spend it on gas and just walk, you can save it and spend it on something useful.

When you think about limiting your car usage, you  can think about getting more exersize. imangine a nice day and you walk  down a strees to go to the store to pick up something small; you can smell the beautiful flowers. Fell the breeze that hits you just right and the sun shinning down on you just the way you like it. You would not be able to experince any of that if you were in your car driving to the store. The best part of car limiting is that there would be less acidents on the road. A great amount of people get injured or killed because of cars. If we did limited our cars usage, people would not die or get injured from cars.

Limited car usage for our fellow citizens has its great advanteages. A hand full of reasons why we should, but if we compare the facts of a car free place. It would be a nicer, safer, and a better place to live.    ",2,0,0.8376859426498413,100.0,0.0,100.0
1b07598,"Polution, the same thing that people have been concerning over and over, not because we can't change it, however because we can. In Germany there's an expirimental town where seventy percent of people do not use an automobile for transportation, also in Paris, France in order to reduce smog and polution. And even in Bogota, Colombia they are holding days in which millions of people go without thier cars.

The first thing about limiting car usage that typically comes up is, how would we get around? By the same means that a normal person without a car would, In fact German researchers actually attempted a study in which they created a small city that is only one square mile that houses more than five thousand people. by walking, riding a bike or skating +70% of Vauban's population go to work and school every single day without using a car. In fact, 57% of families living in Vauban say that they sold thier cars to move into into the city (Elizabeth Rosenthal).

In Paris, durring 2014 Paris repetitively reached almost record breaking levels of polution and smog. As a result of all of that smog, the city of Paris regulated the use of automobiles, this action came as a surprise to the nearly four thousand people that were fined $32 and twenty-seven people's cars were impounded due to how they reacted to the tickets. And as a result of this regulation, typically paris would have about 147 micrograms of PM (particulate matter) per cubic meter average per week, and because they regulated driving the smog levels nearly halved in Paris.

Moving to Colombia, the country of coffee and spices. In the city of Bogota the mayor holds ""car free days"" to reduce smog and the peoples dependance on thier cars. And in order to do so they premote the use of public and alternative transportation and actually fine all of the people that didn't comply a fee of twenty-five dollars. And even thought the fine was a mere $25 the peole responded positively and to this day people in the capital city of more than 7 million people continue to walk, bike and find new ways to get to work and school.

So all in all the tought of cutting back on using cars seems like a good idea that could not only fix the worlds dependance on oil and fossil fuels but also help people get back into shape.    ",3,0,0.8848686218261719,0.0,0.0,0.0

Life with no cars are spreading to places such as, Germany, and Bogota. People will tell you how great their lifes have been without the usage of a car.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Said Heidrun Walter mother of 2, who lives in the Vauban's community. The Vauban community in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe. Bogota, Colombia have limited their car usage as well. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free-day they have in Bogota. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike to work. They've even had people come to watch the event. Like the mayor of Paraguay who said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders.""

""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shif,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Dexel University. Now a days people don't need to drive somewhere to go meet people. They just use the internet, and the use of cell phones have increased in communicating with people. With these changes, people who have stopped car commuting in the United States, may find less reason to resume the habit. But in places such as New York, with new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tools reflect these new priorities. ""Pedestrian, bicyle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmissions and improve safety.""

In conclusion, life with no cars would be beneficial. You'll be provided with better safety, and wont be as tense and alot happier than you were before. You'll be able to see what life is really all about. A better life.    ",3,0,0.7250398993492126,0.0,0.0,0.0

In small towns across Europe people are switching to a fast growing trend- car free cities. Car-free cities are gaining popularity because it works so well. There is more advantages than you may think.

A small town in colomia has started a movement that is growing quick. Similar to the people in Europe they are supporting less car use. They do a car-free day where the goal is to reduce smog and air polution. On car-free day anyone who uses a car will be fined 25 dollars. Since the mid-1990s the town of Bogota has made 118 miles of bicycle paths.

In Paris, France smog is causing problems. Source 2- On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. Odd numbered license plates were picked the following day. The more we drive our cars, the more toxins we put into the air. After a week of less cars the smog reduced significantly. Limiting car-usage can be very rewarding.

The idea of car reduced communities is also taking thought in the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. They have realized how much better driving with less cars really is. Source 4- At the Mobile World Congress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford executive chairmen of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesireable.

Putting a ban on cars on america might not effect us in a way that would be extremely inconveinient either,since the people of today have decreased driving. Also, it would help tremendously with helping the earth and decreasing greenhouse gases and pollution.

Cars have always been one of the top causes of greenhouse gases next to power plants in america. In fact, 50% of greenhouse gases generated in america are caused by passenger cars. Other places such as Bogata, Paris and Germany have limited car usage or banned cars all together to help decrease smog and pollution to better their nations. It would be of benefeit to America to do the same, maybe not ban cars all together because that would put many big car companies out of buisness but perhaps for a day America could walk or bike or ride the bus to work to better our future.

With the younger generation comes change as well. The developement of the unerground and busing systems have made it all together more conveinient to not take a car. Most young people center their activities and jobs around places they can walk or bike to easily. Recently even Bill Ford the chairman for the Ford Motor Company said ""personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable"". He want to partner with telecommunications to provide systems where biking and public transportation decrease emissions and increase safety.

The younger generation of adults have decreased their driving in america. In fact, it has decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009 and baised on that statistic its OK to assume that its just going to go down. So, in reality a day without cars in America wont inconveinience us that greatly anyways. Limiting car usage is benifeicial and an important step to keeping our earth clean. we only get one earth and biking to school or work every now and again is a sacrifice we should be willing to take to keep it for our future generations.                     ",3,0,0.7816802263259888,0.0,0.0,0.0

Carbon emissions are gases that are released into the atmosphere by transportation and other types of industrial manufacturing.

However, most citizens are also wondering what are the advantages of limiting their car usage, and how will it effect the life around their community; There have been ways of doing this as stated in these sources.

The statistics show that ""[a]s a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here""[:] to limit car usage. As it seems economically and environmentally effiecient, people such as Heidrum Walter feel ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (paragraph 3).

People were ""ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22- euro fine ($31), (paragraph 11), and ""[a]lmost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters- an international news agency headquartered in London"" (paragraph 12). Most believed that it was a rivalry between Paris, France and ""Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" (paragraph 14).

Because of the tremendous fog, ""[d]elivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug- in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying [several] passengers. Also, [p]ublic transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC (paragrpah 18).

They participated in this special occasion consecutively for three years, banning cars, but allowing taxi cabs, and buses for the ""Day Without Cars"" in the captial city; This promoted other transportation methods, while reducing smog output. Any people who violated this day were issued "" $25 fines"" (paragraph 21). Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said, ""[i]t's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, as he rode a two- seat bicycle with his wife"" (paragraph 24).

The End of Car Culture , (another article) by Elisabeth Rosenthal, provides more information towards this evolving movement nationwide. Not only is change occuring in the previous countries described, but the United States has started to be part of the change. ""... [G]oals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions..., will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior..."" (paragraph 29).

Numerous researchers are contemplating ""a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?"" (paragraph 30). Over the years the United States of America has gained notoriety for ""its broad expanses and suburban ideals, [which has] long been one of the world's prime car cultures. Over the years, there has been an assembly line in Detroit, Michigan during the '40s- '60s and the ""Model T"" gave Americans the way to take a spin in ""Mustang Sally"" during the ""Midnight Hour"", while listening to Wilson Pickett (paragraph 31).

Overall, most countries including America, have seen changes in their economy. [T]he number of miles driven in 2005 dropped..."" and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway, [b]ut by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way"" (paragraph 32). Rosenthal states that there was a recession, and that the unemployed weren't working, but regardless, the people that were working still couldn't dodge the recession, which ultimately impacted not only the Automotive Industry, but everything else. Car companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranded their businesses (around the world, as it is Ford is an American car and Mercedes is a German car) (paragraph 32).

Pollution has been stopped with limiting the use of cars. People have been riding bikes, walking, etc, to places they have to go. They have sacrificed the use of car but has advanced their lifestyle. The have made a commitment to decrease the population of pollution. There have been talks to start inventing plug-in-cars, hybrids, and car carrying three or more passengers.

There is a main thoroughfare , where the tram runs to downtown Freiburg, and and a ffew streets on the edge of the community but ther e are only two places to park-large garadges on the outside of town. And it cost 40,000 dollars along witha home. If we had cities like this here in the U.S. it would be so much better and there wouldnt be so much pollution.

By limiting the usage on cars it will help save money. Think if you walked or rode you're bike to work everyday then you wouldnt have to pay for gas. Gas is tipically three to four dollars so if you wanted to put thirty gallons of gas in you car it could cost you ninety dollars. Thats a lot of money to spend on gas and thats not even a full tank for some people. Sure if you ride you bike to work everyday you might have to fix it but you're gonna have to fix your car at some point to and bike parts are so much cheaper than car parts so you'd be saving money there too. And if you walked you would'mt have to even worry about fixing your bike. It might take you longer to get to where you need to go but think you'll be saving money and the Earth. You don't even have to ride your bike or walk, you can car pool or take the bus. You still have to pay for the bus but its way cheaper than paying for gas.

If you're limiting your car usage and walking or riding your bike to work everyday, which maens you'll be getting exercise. Most people don't get the exercise they need so by limiting your car usage not only are you helping the environment you're getting the daily exercise you need. Even if you're riding the bus you're gonna have to get to the bus stop some how. And they even have a place to put your bike on the bus so if the bus does'tn take you all the way to where you need to go you can ride your bike the rest of the way.

So limiting your car usage is'nt all that bad. I mean I don't know anyone who does'nt want to help eliminate green house gases, save money and get exercise while doing it.    ",4,0,0.8567835092544556,0.0,0.0,0.0
96b1038,"Transportation by a vehicle like a car is very common these days.  It's an efficient way to travel for the most part, and has been used as an option for traveling since the early 1900s.  Although cars have many upsides, they also have downsides too.  By limiting car usage in more places, there could be many advantages.  First, it could improve safety.  Also, it will conserve resources.  And lastly, limiting car usage will allow a tremendous decrease in pollution.

Limiting car usage will improve safety in a number of ways.  By limiting car usage, there will most likely be a decrease in deaths since many car accidents result in fatality.  It is not only cars colliding with other cars that is the issue; it is cars having the power to destroy most things it comes in contact with. Cars are not toys but rather death machines.  They have the ability to cause major damage which is why if limited usage is enforced, there will most likely be less accidents resulting in major/minor injuries or even death.  There are many options for getting around besides using a car.  For example, there are electric scooters, mopeds, skateboards, rollerskates, bicycles, and even good old-fashioned walking.  While some of these could potentially be dangerous, they are probably not as dangerous as driving a car.

Another reason limiting car usage could be beneficial is the conservation of resources.  Cars are heavy machinery and need an abundance of fuel to keep them going for years and years.  What powers most vehicles currently is fossil fuel.  Fossil fuel is not an everlasting resource and will be gone someday.  Now there are some cars that run on electricity, but for the most part, cars around the world run on fossil fuel.  Considering that there are about one to two cars per household nowadays, that would mean both cars are probably getting filled with gas or even being charged with electricity (which could run your electricity bill through the roof).  Since this applies to most people around the world, think of the resources being used daily.  This usage of resources could be lessened by just limiting the usage of cars.

The last benefit of limiting car usage is less air pollution.  Cars run on fossil fuel, as I stated in the previous paragraph.  When a car is being driven, that fuel exits the car in a gas state.  This gas form of fuel is very harmful to the environment.  With so many cars on the road today, the atmosphere is already polluted a great deal.

Usually you will see signs that read ""No Idling"" outside of a store or any public area where cars are allowed which means that when you are parked, and are going to be parked for an extended period of time, you should turn your car off so that it does not let out gas.  In Paris, a partial driving ban was actually enforced so that the amount of smog in the air would decrease.  That is how much the usage of cars can affect an environment.

Overall, setting a limitation on car usage in more places can have benefits.  It could improve safety, conserve resources, and allow for less pollution to the environment.  With these reasons, I don't see many reasons for people to frown upon this idea.    ",4,0,0.7843382358551025,0.0,0.0,0.0
7a2b44a,"Cars have been around since the early 1900's, but now it seems there is no need for them. The younger generations have not been getting drivers licences and technology is making it easier to ride with someone else or telework. It is an all out war against automobiles and the United States isn't the only one fighting in it. Vauban, Germany, Bogata, Columbia, and Paris, France have all joined the war against personal cars.

How to win a war against cars; stop owning them. Vauban, Germany's population is doing just that. Over half of Vauban's population sold theirs cars so they could live in Vauban, and over seventy percent don't own a car. If people don't own cars, then there is no need for parking. Now, without parking lots or garages all over the place stores and schools can be closer to home. For those that require a car to get to a farther away work there are two parking garages, but to own a spot in one of them one you must buy a home there and pay forty thousand for the parking space. Residents of this experiment have even gone to say that without a vehicle they are less stressed and happier.

Joy was not what Paris communters felt when France closed down the streets to certain vehicles for one week. Why would they close the streets; smog bad enough to rival one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris is usually the European city that has all the smog, 147 micrograms to London's 79.7. So the government decided to do something about it. For five days they alternated from even licensed-plate cars could drive to odd licensed-plate cars could drive. To appease everyone without cars the government made public transportaion completly free allowing those without vehicles to still get to where they needed to go.

In the war against cars public transportation has played a big role. Take the city of Bogata, Colombia for example; every year they have a completly car free day where everyone takes public transportation or walks. Due to the day without cars public transportation is better than ever, as are the sidewalks. Busses have nicer interiors and are more accomodating, and old, cracked sidewalks have turned into smooth, flat sidewalks that are safer for everyone.

Some might say that it is impossible to live without cars, because of illnesses and the lack of safety. However, in Vuaban, Germany people are less stressed which acounts for many immune systems shutting down. In Paris, France they were able to clear their city of smog in five days, without smog there would be nothing to hide the sun on a nice day letting people get vitamen C also while keeping their lungs clear. In Bogata, Colombia public transpotation and sidewalks have improved tenfold since the day without cars started as has safety. Without cars there are no accidents, people cannot injure others by drunk or reckless driving, and it allows the police to watch for crime instead of speeders. Overall our society would benefit grately from becomeing carless.    ",4,0,0.7298626899719238,0.0,0.0,0.0
a59d236,"Cars; most are used by workers, mothers, and pretty much all people in any urban area, they get us from point A to point B. But, as much as we use automobiles do we really  need them? They produce smog, indanger our chiildren and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmoshpereic destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.

In Paris, a few days after near-record pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. ""Congestion was down  60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris (Robert Duffer, par. 14). This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't  use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprizingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.

In Vauban, Germany-- there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost $40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3). And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.

Car free areas have not been limited to just Europe though; in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 (32). Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, ""What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33). The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this car-free revolution.

To wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this car-free quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America's packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has long-term effect on our children. Please consider this, car in the long run are bad for the economy but, as well our health. It's snowing on Mt. Fuji.    ",4,0,0.7858092784881592,0.0,0.0,0.0
44a3cae,"Cars are seen as a necessity due to the fact that they make everyday life/tasks easier; but wait, so can the internet, cellphones and other technological advancements of the modern era. Cars are no longer as useful as they were made to seem due to the fact that the they come at too much of a figurative and literal cost when compared to other technological advancements or houses. Cars emit a large amount of greenhouse gases -""choking cities""- which is a large contributer to air pollution. Along with the toll they place on the enviroment, cars cause stress, leaving a mental and physical toll on your body as well.

Cars are no longer as useful as when they were first invented. They provided forms of easier transportation to communicate and socialize with others, reach the designated location within a shorter time, and limit how much people had to walk. They are stilled used for these purposes today, but are no longer neccessary. The internet allows you to ""feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Although there hasnt been a ""solution"" to having to walk, there shouldnt need to be. Cars give people another excuse for being lazy. In Bogota, there is an annnual day known as Car-free day. on this day, cars are banned from being used and only buses and taxis are permitted in this capital city of 7 million. With a city of so many you would think that the day would have a terrible turnout, but many people benefited from the experience. It alowed people to view the world face to face, instead of behind a sheet of glass. While either riding their bicycle or walking, people are able to take in the sites and try new things that they'd usally pass by while driving.

Cars emit a large amount of greenhouse gases -""choking cities""- which contribute to the worldwide problem known as air pollution. Along with the toll they place on the enviroment, cars cause stress, leaving a mental and physical toll on your body as well. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission. In some car-intensive areas in the U.S. it is 50%. It has gotten so bad that Paris had to enforce a ban on partial driving to reduce near-record pollution. The stress this pollution leaves on the enviroment is similar to the physical and mental toll, caused by cars, on the body. The large amount of car usage causes traffic jams which can lead to stress and aggitation, and sitting in one position for so long can leave stress on the body (cramping.) Cars can also cause mental stress due to the fact that they cost so much. many people choose not to own them do to this fact, but the ones who do are not only required to pay for the car, but also have to pay additional fees for things such as insurance.

Cars are no longer necessary. There have been many technological advancements made to do what cars can do without the toll placed on the enviroment and your body.    ",4,0,0.7623030543327332,20.0,0.0,20.0
2ab0ffc,"""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"", quote from the excerpt ""The End of Car Culture"", explains that people in the United States have started to become less dependent on cars. Not only Americans, but people all around the world such as people from Germany, France, etc. Reasonings for the recent drop in car usage is that there are problems with air pollution, bikes and other transportations that do not involve the use of cars also give place more space to make more town centers and sports complexes, and cars can be a very difficult machine that causes many problems for people everyday.

Smog has become a very big problem for France. France has blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog problems. Diesel is favored more than gasonline due to a tax policy, diesel makes up over 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog in France was so heavy that it, ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" according to an article by Robert Duffer. Smog is a very big issue that should not be taking place it can cause many health problems. France decided that the smog was getting out of hand so they began a ""Car-free day"", this meant that people would not be using their cars for a whole day and some people would not agree with this idea. France started these ""Car-free days"" with the people who had even numbered license plates and then the next day would have cars with odd numbered license plate would not drive their cars. The consequence for not following this rule was a $31.00 or 22-euro fine. Many people were fined the next few days and twenty seven people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. This ""Car-free day"" helped to reduce the smog problem in France.

When people use any type of transportation other than a car they would be able to have many more places to go and have a good time. When people are using cars and other motor vehicles they are also causing more and more construction for new roads and places for cars to be able to park. If people rode bikes and walked more than we would have more places for people to build shops and complexes that are all together and easy to get to. In Vauban, Germany most residents there live a life without the use of cars. ""The streets of Vauban are completely ""car-free""- except the main thoroughfare"", stated in the Article by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Only 30 percent of people in Vauban's familys own cars, the other 70 percent do not own cars. More than half of that 70 percent sold their cars just to live in Vauban. In Vauban they have begun to create more sidewalks that are better accesible for bikes and walking. This has created more room for people to construct new stores and places that are walkable distance for citizens, so less car usage could lead to many new places such as shops, stores and even new sports complexes.

Cars can be very difficult machines that cause many problems for people everyday. They can just stop in a matter of seconds and people would not know what happened, causing people to get their cars checked out at a car-shop and paying more money to get the problem fixed. If people began walking or using bikes as transportation they would not only be saving money but would lower the problems they would be having getting to and from places. Not using cars can save so much money for people because they would not have to pay much gas and they would not have to go to get their cars fixed almost every year. Even with bikes there might be a problem such as getting a flat tire or the chain popping off, even those little things would cost only a few dollars where as a trip to the car-shop would cost a least $100.00 out of pocket.

Limiting the use of cars can potentially save places from smog and more air pollution. Not using cars as much can leave more space for places to be built, instead of using the space as a parking lot people could use that space as a place for shopping or sports complex. Car-free day could even be a very helpful idea that might change the peoples minds to use other types of transportations besides a car. Having no cars could save a numerous amount of money for a lot of people. They will save money by not having to get a lot of gas and they will save money on not having to fix their cars almost every year. So limiting the use of cars could become a potential idea that can help people around the world.                                           ",5,0,0.6826876401901245,25.0,0.0,25.0
8c635e6,"The articles explain that the limited use of cars or automobiles is to our advantage. Two reasons that support this theory is that one you won't have to stress about buying a car and making sure everyone has one, and second you will help to protect the environment from the harmful gases of automobiles.

The limitation on cars may have its advanatges because, among the billions of people on this earth many of them own cars. Many vehicles give off harmful pollution gases to the environment and can cause many endangering problems to people as well. Evidence from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" can support the following... ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a parial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This evidnce supports the fact that there was enough smog in the air that led to the prohibition of cars for a limited time. This is to the people's advantage because they were now able to breathe fresh air instead of smog. Another piece of evidence also comes from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensyfying smog...[The smog] rivaled with Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" This evidence shows that smog causes pollution which is harmful in many ways. It also shows just how much of a difference just five days of limitation on vehicles can help reduce pollution. So the sooner people can see what banning cars can do to their health and well-being then maybe they will see what the love and cherish so much, can actually be hurting them.

Car limitations may be the best thing yet for America and other places in the world. By banning cars we could reduce a lot of stress and the worry about the payments and supplying the vehicle with gas. Evidence that can support this comes from source 4: "" The End of Car Culture""  ""the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995....recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" This explains that many Americans cannot even afford cars. So they go about their days just fine taking public transportation or receivin rides from friends. So by banning cars we could actually reduce the stress of not having a car or making the payments on them... plus we would have better health. Out of the estimated 7 billion people on this earth, it is not guranteed that all of them around the ages of 15 and above are equipped with a a vehicel of their own. Evidence from Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"" can support the following "" What most intrigues me is the rates of car ownership per househols and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" Thi just goes to show you that not only are cars bad for the enviornment and people's health but, they are bad financially for people to maintain and keep up. The automobile is what changed America back in the day. But it is causing some damae to us now.

Car limitations have some advanatges that are probably very beneifcial to us. We may think that cars are our only way of transportaion and that you need them to survive but, that is not necessarily true. Cars are great but up to a certain extent.            ",5,0,0.81405109167099,28.57142857142857,0.0,28.57142857142857
4b037f4,"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmoshere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town car-free. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completeley true since plug-in cars, hybrids, and other earth-friendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of foosil fuel-powered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.    ",6,0,0.8072234392166138,12.5,0.0,12.5
