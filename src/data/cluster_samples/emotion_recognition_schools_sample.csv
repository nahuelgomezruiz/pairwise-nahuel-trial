fac246b,"Introduction: ''Calculate'' emotion like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?

Inteiductiuon: ''Calculation'' every day.

For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

Introduction: ''Putting a happy face'' actually works!

Body1. Emotions are so important to everyone because without emotions there's no happy life. Being happy sad in life is not a chioce its either you happy or sad. All lide ask you to just to be happy i know it might not be happen all the time but we have to making happen. Being happy is a choice for yourself in life nobody your make day you have to make ypu own choice. When you make good choice in life you make your life more easliy.

Body2.''Calculation'' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Calculation every day is not a bad choice if you just know what you doing. Life is not that hard i thought it would be sometimes we just need sometimes to think about our life. Sometimes i keep asking myself why others can't put themselves together and be a parther and why they treat humans like them bad. Its doesn't matter anymore in this world if God died for us and he forgive us we have to the same thing to others. Forgiveness is a big choice, all we need right now is to have a big smile in our face i know it gonna be hard but if we trust in ourself we can do it nothing is hard in life you just give it a try.

Body3.''Putting a haappy a actually works! Yes it does sometime but not all the time most of the time it works just the way you needed. The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring smile. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. Constatin stanislausky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and creating these amotion on stage.

ac611e6,"The new technology it was created by, what does it do,is it a good thing. The software is the latest innovation fro professer. Thomas Huang,of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the Universiy of illinos,working in collaboation with Professer Nicu. Sebe of the University. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better way for human and coumputers to communicate.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the the model must move like humans muscels. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of pyschologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman,creator of FACS.

They want to use this technology to help in a classroom to see when a kid is confused or boerd to help them to plan lesson that the kids will learn from. Eckman has claaified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles

I think we should use the new technology in classroom because I think I will become dectration to kids because they will want to play with it to see her they feel. This type of technology should be use for treapist to help read patient when they are talk about their life so the treapist know how they felt about that part in there life.",1,7,0.7423305511474609
e4020f0,"In this article I feel like the computers to identify some human emotions is cool. I want them to create a great technology like that, because it would be nice to look at someones human emotions. ""Dr. Huang said that the facial expression for each emotion are universal."" The calculations of the emotions will be endless. The Mona Lisa demonstration help people to smile more.

The people who wants to create this experiment wants it to become a success. This technology can make you laugh at anymoment. Also the emotions can change big time by pressing one key on the computer. They try to create these emotions by make people emotions change in their body.

In conclusion the main reason of this article was to show people that they can controll whatever they feel like it. Also most people in life wants to get controlled by some type of leader in life. They want to help people to wants to act to act better by changing their emotions in the act. Also I love the way that the mona lisa actitvity can change one single person emotion.

ea16a1a,"Why they invent Facial Action Coding System? Well in my personal opinion this is a good experiment for student, family, etc, because sometimes people do not want show they emotions or feeling, for example: If a girl of school that has depression or personal problems and she do not want talk abaut that with her teacher or consuler and this girl is thinking in kill herself, if the school have the Facial Action Coding System the professor can save her life, that a great experiment, but one thing is all school can't have it because are expense so this experiment can't help to all students or families that need.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, the Dr. Huang says ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" he is trying to said that they experiment is not just for people, he is says that is universal so that mean is for all that have face or that the Facial Action Cording System can read emotions for example:The Facial Action can read the Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa.

In conclusion the

Facial Action Coding System is a veryy good option for school they can saves lifes, and evit masacres of students with that Facial Action and be a major country. ",2,7,0.8231720924377441
045fabf,"Would you think its interesting for computers to analyze your emotion? imagine a computer showing if you're sad, wouldn't that be cool? Well if you think thats cool, Dr. huang and his colleague are creating new ways to figure out people's emotions through computers!

That is a good idea because this could impact investigation, like cops figuring out who the're dealing with. For example, say there was a bank robbery and the criminals got away, but soon the cops found them and arrested them, they could either sit down with them and try and work their way around to see if the're is something wrong with them or they could just snap a picture and figure out thier expressions by using the FACS, (Facial Action Coding System). that would make it easier on investigators because the artical says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly"". using video imagery, the new software tracks the facial movements in a real face. This technolgy can improve how well things are animated too, like on tv, and video games. overall i think this is a gonna impact so many cool things that is still to come.

The FACS is gonna change alot of things in a positive way, its going to improve ivestigation and recgonizing different facial expressions to those who are either really happy or really sad and depressed. ",2,7,0.7632877826690674
fc19ca6,"According to the article the Facial Action Code System i think is valuable to student in classroom's. I am for it because aacording to the text its tells you how great it can predict how your feeling. The article gives us a little information on how accurate it works numbers showing she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry it shows that the Facial Action Code System is an new way to figure out people's emotions. Also it says the Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Also this new software can show a lot about your emotions for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Also i think its a good idea for students in classroom because the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and your teacher could help you or could try to do something more to keep you from getting bored. I think from the articlke this would be a great thing to get and to start using because according to the text its a great tool to use in the future. ",2,7,0.8558624982833862
185b01a,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions to see humans' reactions while they are using their computers. Computers can recognize emotions by the way you look, and it is allow to the computers to understand your feelings, and to change the topic because they used this technology to see Mona Lisa's emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" When technology developed they started their project with a 3-D computer.

A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a ""Web ad appears"" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are.

According to the text in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang explains how the computer might work if the student doesn't like what he/she has in the computer and it says ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers can understand that, too."" It means that technology has developed, Dr. Paul Eckman and Dr. Huang created the FACS to see humans emotions, it has six basic as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The Doctors are showing that the new computers can see what it is in your mind because they improved the technology.

My conclusion is that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a good appications for a variety of industries because it is able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. The new technology has ""Empathy because it can feels someone else's emotions and can handle the complex algorithms. ",2,7,0.8658804297447205
3f300cc,"The Facial Action Coding System technology is a new thing to detect how people are feeling using the computer. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom because it teaches students how to use new technology. Using this system shows the students what all jobs are avalible in the technology field too.

Using technology like this can help improve the way students use computers and help them get jobs. in the future. Most new jobs rely on some sort of technology or require you to know how to use it. With this new tech people might have a job lined up that they did not know about.

This technology can also be good for detecting if someone is feeling bad or is depressed. They can use this as a form of helping people out if no one can tell they are sad. For instence in paragraph three ""Eckman had classified six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."". If they can use this to treat people who are not happy it can solve a bunch of problems in the future.

Since they can use this technology to see peoples real emotions they can tell students' emotional expressions. If they are sad they can do something to make them happy again and get better grades. I think this type of technology will become something greater than it already is.",3,7,0.8783283233642578
c98f82e,"Have you ever wondered how the kids feel in class but they dont ever participate and/or express themselfs. Well this article about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is a great way to figure out some ways that some kids feel based on what they are learning. It is smart, unique, and valuable. These are the reason why the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea.

The Facial Action Coding System is smart because it allows you to see if the students are bored, interested, or just out of it during the lesson you teach. And you could also figure out different type of ways to manke a lesson or activity better that excites the children you are teaching to. In the article it states "" Most humans communication is nonverbal,including emotional communcation."" So this is basically saying that if we are not communicated with our mouths then what better way then communicating with facial expressions. This is why the Facial Coding System is smart.

It's is unquie because no-one has ever thought of this until now so the fact that teachers action care about how there students feel should touch some people. its also unique because it can tell the way your face is moving and the way your muscles move. In the articke it states that

""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face: all 44 major muscles in the model must move like the human muscles.""This just pushed to shove that if a computer can track all of your muscles in your face that that's pretty unique and different. And on top of that, they would pay that much money to make sure the kids have a good education is cool.

Lastly its valuable because if it's bettering the kids education and making a difference in their community, thats good. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" its says ""feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression. Whoever tought thta making faces could reveal so much about science of emotions."" This is why its valuable because it can tell us things that we might not know but the computer knows.

This is why the Making Mona Lisa Smile and the Facial Action Coding System is smart, unique, and valuable in so many ways. If you dont think that you should get the Facial Action Cosing System you might want to think twice if you really love your students.    ",3,7,0.7923930883407593
18397b4,"Its valuable to use a technolgy that can read the emotional expressions of a student. I find it important to know how someone really feels and what they may be going through. For an example, many people hide what they truly feel, because of what others think. I have a great friend that really does not express themselves when we go out and hang, she always seems to be bored. The reality is that she has fun and likes the things I like, She may seem like she is bored, but you can tell when she is enjoying herself, she makes a small smile and looks over to the other side when she does not want me to see that she is having fun.

Having Leonardo da Vinci's painting of Mona Lisa is a great way to tell others an expression of all six basic emotions. The way Leonardo used his painting to get every single muscle to go with its roll in each six basic emotional expression of Mona Lisa.

We all have six basic emotions, which are: happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and saddness. It is a surprise knowing when we humans are surprised an expression is shown in our faces, in the third paragraph the author says "" your frontails pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow"" when you're surprise. The most common facial expression is happy. In paragraph 7 it talks about how the instructions above were a happy face instuction, it also includes how their is a difference between a real and a false smile. Us humans have real emotional expressions. Our true expression never lie how we truly feel, as said in paragraph 8 "" faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politican or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

In todays world many people express themselves and many people don't. In the reality many people hide what feel and make a lying expression, with noticeable information on the lying expression. In instance in paragraph 7, with the instuctions of making a smile, Having a false smile is different than a real smile. For example, in paragraph 8 the author talks about the muscle in the smile, "" muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make a crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This tells how a false expression can be noticable and yet use to make a lie.

A technology that can read an expression of a student would be great, so that a teacher may know how a student is feeling and can help or observe. As known many famous people lie about how they feel and we as humans are no different than a celebrity. We all have emotion expressions that we express and falsely express to fool someone. Helping the ones who are sad and angry, fear and disgusted to succed and the ones who feel happy to succed as well.

Having the technology that can read emotion expressions in a classroom of student is valuable. Since most students don't want to express their feeling phiscally. These are my reasons why having a technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable.       ",3,7,0.7675753235816956
6943ce3,"In this article the author describes the Facial Action Coding System and descrbes the wide range of its usefullness and power. From this article we can see how this new technology finds emotion through a face as well as how that information looks once it's calculated. From this passage I feel that this technology is very useful and could help alot of people.

One of the many uses for this technology is that it has the ability to help others when they are bored or confused in a classroom. This technology can modify the lesson in order for the student to better convey the information needed. This helps students get a better understanding of the material while still learning in a way that fits that students prefrences. If this were to be in schools today I feel that it would help thoughs who may be failing not because they want to but because they aren't understanding the material.

This technology can also help adults as well wheather it would be for advertising ,for video game companies,or for video surgery. When it comes to advertising this technology can recognize the enjoyment or displeasure you may get out of an advertisment. Say you like it and smile, the computer may regognize this and continue to provide you with similar ads that fit what you like. As for the last two being about video games and video surgery these two can construct faces in a more exprssive way than it would without this technology.

This article shows just how useful this technology is and represents just how far technology has come since. This is an important resource that could help many with alot of things. As well as help teach those who are confused. And even to better advertise a product to someone. And for these reasons I feel that this technology is valuable.       ",3,7,0.8720138669013977
1e54a02,"Facial Action Coding System I think is a good idea because if someone is trying to figure out how you are feeling and you don't tell them they can look on the computer and tell what your emotions are. In the passage it tells that the computer is 3-D and has 44 major muscle. This tell us that if a friend is feeling a way you can tell and you would actually know itts true and not false. In paragraph one it explains to me that there are six basic emotions and they are happiness, surprise , anger ,and ect. For example your frontalis muscle above your eye raises your eyebrows when you are surprise. Some people wouldnt think that this is possible but I think its something good.

When a student is looking at the computer they can pick up all emotions like if you have mixed emotions or just one. Someimes teachers want to know how they students are feeling but just don't want to walk up to the and just ask. This computer I think was a wonderful thing that someone can make. If I ever had this computer it would be very useful to me because want to know how others feel.

Some people who try to just look at someone and tell how they are feelings is not always helpful they might think its one thing but its another. Most people are not just good by going off someone's look but this computer can help out alot you don't need to try and guess what that person is feeling. Evan when some artist are trying to draw a ppersons emotion they don't always know either they would also need the computer . Dr. Huang says in te story that Da Vinci has and comuter when he draw so that he could get the specific factial expression.

If I was to get one of these computes i would like to use it on everyone around me because I love to see people happy and if they are not I would like to make there day. If I am taking a test and I get confused I know that the computers see that and the teacher would know and try to help me out a little. Using these can help everyone out in so many differen ways.

Eveyone should have one of these or get an computer lie this one. If you really need to know about smeone you just would look on it to see what it is. This would be good when a school have a play and the people that are watching them need or want to figure out how the characters feel.   ",3,7,0.8732861280441284
a5cc40d,"The FACS( Facial

Action Coding System) is a computer software that can scan the muslces of someones face and tell the emotions that person is feeling. The FACS seems like a very useless peice of software.

In the article, you read about how they used this software to ""decode"" the face of the Mona Lisa. The software was said to have worked and was able to tell the emotions she was feeling that very day. She was eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Using this type of software on students in class will be useless and also a waste of time. Decoding the face of a student in class wont change anything in the class room. Paragraph six, line six, the author is telling how we can use the software to tell when a student is becoming confused or bored in class and is able to modify the lesson for the that student. Using this software would only be effeciant to those who learn on computers. A teacher could not use this software on a big class full of students because she would get differnt emotions from many different students. The teacher would not be able to give a lesson for just a couple of students in class based on the FACS

The FACS( Facial Action Coding System) would be useless for students. Online schooling could use this software but students in a class room would make the software useless          ",3,7,0.7975305318832397
a948dbe,"The Facial Action Coding System is a great idea for students to use. With technology advancing so much it is essential for the school assignments to advance along with it. This technology is the next step for students and teachers alike. The FACS should read the facial expressions of students because it could keep students engaged, and addresses whether or not they understand the subject.

The FACS is able to keep the student from getting bored. While working on the computer for so long a student can easily get bored and tune out the lesson. The FACS though, can use its technology to make the content more engaging; like making ""computer animated faces more expressive"" (D'Alto). By making faces and other aspects of the lesson more interesting students have a higher chance of keeping their interest in the lesson. This is just one example of how useful the Facial Action Coding System could be for the students outside of class.

The FACS also would tell when the student is struggling or is confused with the material. Normally in a class setting a student can ask a teacher for help, but it is not that simple on the computer. Instead of the student continuing to not understand the work the system ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto). This way the student can be sure to get the correct information and not miss out on anything from lack of understanding. This is another reason as to why the FACS would be a great tool for the learners.

To close, the FACS is the right step for helping students. Not only does it keep them interested in the lesson, but also helps when the student is confused. This technology can be beneficial to students and teachers because of all of the usefull features that it offers. Since ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotiuonal communication...computers need to understand that too"" to fully utilize the technology that is available to help the children learn.",4,7,0.8209935426712036
587f42e,"Do you think that the use technology is valuable for detecting emotional expressions? well I think that it is not valuable for us. I will be naming some reason why in this essay. If you are intrested in knowing more of why it wouldn't be valuable for us please read on.

A reason that I think that this type of technology wouldn't be valuable to us because I don't think it is important to try to understand how someone feels or what emotions they are having at that moment. They probably wouldn't want you to know because if they did they would probably tell you. It's none of our business honestly, however how we be for sure that this type of technology would even work. There is supposed to be 44 major facial muscles in our face and the computer is supposed construct that using a 3-D model but what happenes if it misses a muscle and the calculations are all wrong. Then you wouldn't exactly know what they are really feeling. The computer would not be giving you the excat emotion.

Also, There is a mucle called orbiculars oculi pars palpabraeus that makes crow's feet around your eyes, so if computers scans someone's face that has that then the computer would give out false information about the person is feeling just because of the face when this person could really happy. Another muscle that is created is called the risorius that could put on a false smile that make your mouth skretch sideways creating a smile that could make you look happy when your actually sad. The computer could also scan a person like that and would again give false information. I believe that the computer can be wrong because everything won't be correct as they should be.

Another way, is that a person could just not smile at all like how Mona Lisa was once before and they could be extremly happy, but if a computer were to scan how that the computer would give results of sadness but that is not actually how the person is feeling. Computers just can't calculate how a person is feeling 100 percent of the time and be correct about it. Yes, a computer can communicate with humans but not emotionally. This is a new type technology can have it's ups and downs but I think that it will have more downs than ups.

However, another mucsle called frontalis pars lateralis could make you seem suprised just by raising an eyebrow but that doesn't always mean your confused or shocked it could mean many other things. The computer can calculate that your confused just by raising your eyebrow because it could calculate your face expressin not emotion. Facial expressions are universal and could all mean different things and a computer wouldn't clearly be able to tell how someone is feeling. Dr. Huang observed the artist da vinci for human anatomy to help paint mucsles precisely but his software only have similar anatomical information as electronic code, so his software doesn't the exact electronic codes it need so it could be wrong about how people are feeling.

To hence, I don't think that technology to read emotions are valuble because the computer could be wrong and not give the exact emotion, it could falsly give how someone is feeling due to a muscle in a persons face to make them look a certain way, and that the computer could not create the exact face because it mioght miss a muscle and give the wrong expression.

5700ff4,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System should become part of the technology used in classrooms. This technology would not only be a scientific break through, but would also provide a alternative to how efficently students learn.

Althoguh the creation of the Facial Action Coding System was recent, the idea of the technology has been around for centuries. Dr. Thomas Huang, co-creator of the software, claimed that much more simplified versions of the software have been used for for a long time. The professor claimed that artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci, studied anatomy to be able to make anthropomorphic figures as naturalistic as possible. The artist would use their knowledge of anatomy to create naturalised facial muscles, which would accurately reflect emotions of the subjects. But this technology could help not only the artistic community, but entire generations.

Dr. Huang strengthens his argument for the emotion-reading software by claiming its benefitial usage in the classroom. Dr. Huang said, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The professor is predicting that with the help of his software, the way children learn could be changed for the better. With the help of this software, students would be able to focus on topics longer, whic poses a problem for many students today. Students would be able to learn or strenghten skills without having to voice their boredom or confusion with topics. This would benefit them as they grow because they would be able to fully understand topics and skills insteading of falling behind simply becasue they lose interest. For example, a young student would be able to learn multiplication possibly faster and stronger than older students because with this software, they would be able to focus on each problem. As the child grows, they have a less likely chance of falling behind in other mathmatical courses because they have no need for relearning multiplication, and are able to solve problems quickly because they know what they are doing. Also, multiplication is all over the world, so they would be comfotable to use it in their day to day life. In the end, this child was able to succeed with a mathmatical skill simply because of a facial software that kept them involved and growing in their studies.

1f65a7f,"Being able to calculate if someone is happy or sad is not valuable. People themselve should be able to tell if someone is happy or sad even if they are covering it up. Dr. Eckman is able to detect if someone is happy or sad without FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). You can detect someone's emotions by the way they are acting.

Even without the new technology that the doctors invented to detect your emotions people should be able to tell if someone if happy, sad, etc. People should be able to tell if they are sad when they arent talking as much as they used to or mad when they have a bad attitude. They could tell when their happy when they are acting normal and laughing at jokes. Also your mostly with the people that you know the best so you should be able to tell their emotions.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS, is able to detect someones emotions without his new system. If Dr. Eckman could teach people how to detect someone's emotions then it would spread across the world then nobody would need the new system. When Dr. Eckman told us to look in the mirror and do the three steps he provided he was teaching us how to detect if someone is happy. Dr. Eckman created something that could be easily taught to people around the world. If people are able to be taught what FACS could do then therefor you do not need FACS.

Many people all around the world mostly are only with people that they really know personally. You should be able to detect how someone close to you is feeling be how they are acting. If they are not acting normal they obviously something is wrong, so now you need to find out what is wrong. They could detect if they are sad if they are not talking a lot and moslty just sitting around. If they are mad you could just look at their facial expressions when you tell them something and be able to tell if they are mad. So you should easily be able to detect the mood of somebody be the way they are acting.

The FACS that Dr. Eckman created is most likely expesive to make and install, also could talk alot of time. So if he would just teach people how to detect peoples different emotions by their facial expressions they he could be saving a lot of time and money. Once Dr. Eckman has taught people then people will then begin to teach other people, which then would lead to nobody needing the FACS.           ",4,7,0.6890339851379395
edf05ec,"The Facial Action Coding system. It can read almost any face, and tell weither what emotion you have having. You could use this for many diffrent things such as; busting a crimanal, telling if a person around you acully is happy around you, or even if someone is lying to you. But one other important thing this technology can be used for is school.

Lets say you were at school and you were getting bullied or you werent having a good day. You are trying to hide your emotions but your quiet good at it. But the moment you sit down at a computer, it scans your face and it says that you are sad/depressed. The moment the computer reads your face it can alert the teacher and it can tell if the student is enjoying or disliking the class or school in general. Then, when the teacher knows his/her emoiton, he could ask the student why they are feeling this way and if they need to talk. It could make the students feel special and that they dont need to hide there emotions from people and can feel totally comfortable expressing themselves.

Even with that sanificant factor of helping children out with there emotions, there is also some cons about have this system. Facial Action Coding System could almost make the parents a bit worried about there children and be wondering would it could be doing. What if foreigner parties start to hack the system. There could be major problems such as; knowing who you are, having your facial ID, and a chance of getting captured. Some parents are really strict with their children not letting them show there face to a camera just because they are aware of the dangers that could happen.

Another con is that the system could malfunction. Since is sends the information and emotion to teacher/parents the teacher could get worried and ask why this student has this emotion but little do they know that there was wrong information sent. Lets say the student his sitting as his desk and the system scanned his face over a multitude of facial moment and it says your sad, but on the inside you are acually fairly happy. Then the teacher could ask you why he or she is sad, and would try to help him out. But little do they know is that he really happy and something went wrong with the system. It would be pointless, there would be no advantage in having this. It would take time out of your day and there could be a whole ordeal about weither your sad or happy.

But also the Facial Action Coding System could help us find out is is someone has cheated on a test, or is mad at another student. It can prevent many of dangerous thing from happening in the school such as a school shooting for example. If a student was angry 24/7 at school it could aller and worry the teachers that something drastic could happen and a gun could be pulled out. But you can prevent that from happening with the Facial Coding System, you could see that the student is mad all the time and the teachers could reach out and help the student before something drastic happens.

Over all I think it would be a great idea to have a system like this in our schools today because some people are really hurting on the inside, and sometimes us humans can not tell weither if the person is sad, mad, or happy. We could prevent self harm with this! We could stop many of things from happening in our schools today. I think every school should start to incorporate this system into there labtops and computers because it could really help a student out. We could make people the outcasts feel important for once. It would make there day knowing the fact that somone cares about them.

We could help a lot of things we do in school today, it was be a good benefit factor having this system in schools. ",5,7,0.8483452200889587

Being able to associate muscle movements throughout ournface with the true current emotion someone has seems to be impossible, by the Facial Actiom Coding System can attest to that. The Facial Action Coding System could revolutionize the way classrooms are run and impact schools in a great way by altering the way classes are run based on students emotions. It would be a great idea to have this system installed as a classroom computer because it could modify the lesson for students based on their understanding, teachers can detect the truth of students emotions about the class, and it can help students better their emotions or see for themselves how their emotions seem to be.

Having this facial expression reading system installed in classrooms can benefit many classes with better understandings. “Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor [based on the students emotions].” Detecting how students truly feel about the lesson could be a big help in how classrooms run. For instance, if the majority of the class is sensed to be confused about the lesson, teachers are then able to see that they need to spend more time on it or reevaluate how they are teaching the lesson and slow it down. If the computer senses that the class is bored, they may not learn as well if they don't care about what they are learning so the teacher could possibly change up the class with a game. Overall it could greatly benefit classes as a whole.

This computer can help teachers and they way they run the class and teach the lesson as well. Teachers could use this technology as a baseline for themselves to see how their classes react and feel about the way they run their class. “A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,” Dr. Huang predicts. This would greatly benefit students as well because no students want to tell their teachers that they hate the way their class is run and be honest with them. This would give teachers true insite about their class and would want to make it as beneficiary to students as possible. If teachers saw that students weren't enjoying their class they could altar it in some way to make it better for everyone.

This system being installed in classrooms could also help students see what their emotions look like and possibly make them better. If students knew what their emotions looked like outside of themselves, it could be a big eye opener for them to see what they may seem to be like and that they may not know themselves. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" If students saw how their emotions looked and they weren't good they could try to change them which studies show actually could change them by just having different facial expressions. This could help all students if they were mad or sad and it detected that, they could put a smile on their face which may actually help better their emotions.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a great idea to put into classrooms that could better everyone as a whole class as well as individually. It would be an amazing idea because it could modify the lesson for students based on their understanding, teachers can detect the truth of students emotions about the class, and it can help students better their emotions or see for themselves how their emotions seem to be. Every teacher would run their classroom to make it as beneficial to students as possible if they could and with this installed into classrooms, it could happen. The Facial Acting Coding System would change classrooms for the better and help teachers and students expedentially.",5,7,0.8604599237442017
71b6e79,"Everyone in the world makes different facial expressions everday. It's not necessarily something people try to do, but it is a natural way to express emotion. New technology called Facial Action Coding System allows doctors and scientists to evaluate people's facial expressions as a way of telling how they are feeling. Administrators should use the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom because it is valuable in ways such as engaging students in lessons, being able to tell if a student is experiencing negative emotions, and it will help students learn about facial expressions and what they mean.

One reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the classroom is because it would keep students engaged in lessons. In the article, it says that the computer program would have the ability to see when a student is getting bored or confused. Once it recognized this, it would reengage them in the lesson. This is the same things teachers do, but if a teacher was busy with another student, the computer just completed the task for them. This would be an effective way for students to continue their learning in an innovative way.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System would be useful in the classroom would be that the technology would be able to tell if the student was experiencing negative emotions. If someone knows their friend well, they are likely going to notice if they seem sad or downtrodden. However, if their friend is trying to hide their emotions, they might not even know something is wrong. On the other hand, if the computer systems were in the classroom, it would be able to tell if their were other negative emotions hidden from the human eye such as depression. This is evident from the article when it says that the Mona Lisa painting is, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry""(D'Alto). These results could be surprising to some because to the normal human eye the Mona Lisa seems completely happy and few would guess she's actually angry or fearful. So, this would help administators know if there was emotionally something they could do to help their students.

The final reason the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms is because it could teach students about recognizing facial expressions in people and what they mean. So, the technology is not only useful because it helps the students' emotional health, but also because it could help students help each other. If students learn how the computer tells how people are feeling, and they do the same, then the students will be able to recognize emotions and attain help for people they might think need emotional support. This would go above what humans are able to tell about how people feel on a regualar basis.

So, the

Facial Action Coding System would be useful in classrooms for a plethora of reasons. For one, it would recgonize if students were straying away from the lesson, and it would pull them back in. Also, the technology would be able to detect negative emotions within a student which could be presented to the teacher so they could help the student. Finally, the technology would be able to inform students on how to recognize emotions of people and could teach them all of the science and technological aspects of the sofware. This innovative facial technology could help students a trememdous amount in the classroom.    ",6,7,0.8767629861831665
