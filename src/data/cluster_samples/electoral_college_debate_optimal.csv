e4131fa,"I would agree with keeping the Electoral College because its a fair way to elect the president of the united states. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final dessision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law varys how many are selected. The presidential election is held every four yearson the tuesday after the first monday of november.

The states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the disrict of Columbia. You can help choose your states electors when you vote forpresident. Even though your voting for your candidate your really voting for the candidates electors. Most states have a winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election your govenor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of your candidates who ran for president in your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state at the meeting of the electors in December. Then the certificate is sent to the congress  and the national records of the presidential election.    ",1
d19c417,"I would argue in favor of keeping the electoral college because its bests to vot eby what the people want in able to keep a good country. I also think that if people werent allowed to vote how would the main leaders know whats the right and what is the wrong.

To start off , due to the passage ''Electoral college'' is a process in which the founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise election of the president by congress and qualified citizens! NOT the leaders! If your want to run for president your main goal is to get people to follow you with impression and facts.

Each presidential election occurs every four years. Candidates enter in election competing against each other,'' the people'' watch if the candidate will be worth a president. Candidates will be eliminated one after another till there is only one winner.

Without the electoral college how would the people know if the president is trustworthy to the country, mainly people just want someone who is willing  to make the right changes. Like i said the leader's main goal is to get people to agree  and make them think that you are worth for the job. No one will appreciate someone making the laws without people agreeing the people would be furious and the word freedom wouldnt exsist anymore in the country. Freedom is all about peoples rights! Electoral college is a main process that is need to be able to make freedom for the citizens.                ",2
360aac0,"Dear state senator,

I think that we should keep the Electoral College. By keeping the Electoral College, there will be no problems in elections to where no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The process is like a ""winner-take-all"" system. In the Electoral College a presidental candidate must have trans-regional appeal.

To begin, there are run-off elections. Run-off elections will make sure that no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electorial College will help make it clearer to see which candidate is the winner. For an example in 1992 Clinton had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, then won a majority in the Electoral College.

Next, the Electoral College has a ""winner-take-all"" process. States such as Florida (29), Texas (38) and California (55) have a high amount of electoral votes. If there was a tie between two candidates and the votes from Florida were not put in yet, one of the candidates has a better chance of winning. Most candidates will try to persuade and win the higher states votes so that they will have a better chance of winninig. What's nice about the Electoral College, it causes the toss-up states to pay close attention the the campaign.

Finally, every candidate running for office must have a trans-regional appeal. None of the regions in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect the new president. When a canidate goes and campains in one region without thinking about he will not gain his electoral votes. Normally a candidate that has only regional appeal will be unlikely to be a successful president.

To conclude, the choice of keeping the Electoral College would very very wise and helpful. The Electoral College makes sure that there are run-off elections, it has a ""winner-take-all"" system, and that every canidadte running should be trans-regional. Even though in the Electoral College is not democratic and that only a slate of electors vote, a decent amount of times of when the people would pick that one candidate the electors would pick the same one.

d496ca5,"Do you think its time to get rid of Electoral College? Or change to election by popular vote for the presdient of the United States?

An Electoral College constist of 538 electors but a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. To win so easily by just getting Electoral votes just seems really unfair. We should change to election by popular vote for the president of United States because it seems like a more fair challenge to earn the title of President of the United States.

Each candidate running for presdient in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generaly chosen by the candidates poltical party, but state laws vary on how the electors are slected and what their responsibillites are.

What the electoral college system does is you dont vote for the president, you vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. As an example of Electoral college system , Stated in paragraph 10 ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, And wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, You'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. On the off-change that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to cocngress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes"". The electors can be anyone not holding a public office.

That just doesnt sound fair to win an election just by having more electoral votes, when you have less popular votes.

Basically the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winnter-take-all ssytem in each state. Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. 25 if the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the prsidency in the hands of a few swing voters Ohio, They have yet to make it.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It doesnt make sense to have such a thing for out presidents. They should win by popular votes because it will be fair to let out people choose who should win not only 270 electoral votes, out of thousands of people that want to vote normally.    ",3
a8ed947,"Dear State Senator, most people in this country may argue that th Electoral College is well layed out system in which according to source #3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"", which means presidents are always looking for support from small states, which is based on population, to be voted for because in the big states little to no votes are accepted by the Electoral College. I disagree, I believe that this method is wrong and unfair for the peope so I argue against it.

To begin with, according to source #2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states"", this means that in some states one candidate might have a better chance of winning than the other candidate and even though a candidate is at disadvantage because the other takes all the votes because of the electoral college that candidate might win and the people of that state will not even know who is this winning candidate until they see him on tv as an actual prsident, which probably means that the winning candidate won't help that state because he does not know well enough about it. Additionally, acording to source #3 ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney ws in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plularity in states that he knows he will win"", this means that in order to win the presidency a candidate must get to know other regions but because in this case Mitt Romney vs. Barrack Obama, Obama was the regional favorite for the North Romney was at a disadvantage, which is what the Electoral College ultimately wants.

To conclude with, I think that the method of using the Electoral College to elect presidents is wrong and unfair. Furthermore, according to source #2 ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdate, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" this means that the electoral college is just not fit for the modern democrat world of today and mostly people argue against it.

5446002,"The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something.

When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, and humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.

As I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematicaly try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.

In America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country's future, and not feel as if their state doesn't matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples' minds, but I'm sure the votes aren't tied.    ",5
