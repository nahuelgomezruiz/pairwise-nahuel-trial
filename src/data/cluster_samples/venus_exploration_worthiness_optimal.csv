9e6ccfe,"The author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present.""vening star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an anmateur stargazer to spot"". this quote is telling us that the eveing star is really bright and its the most beautyfull star of all stars in the sky.

""often referred to as earths twin venus is the closest plant to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too"". this quote is showing us the closest planets to the Earth. venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysrem, even though mercury is closer to our sun. The national aeronautice and space administration NASA has one particularry compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA possible solution to the hodtile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. imagine a blimp like vehile hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusain landscape. At 30 plus miles above the surface temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radition would not exceed earth levels not easy condition but survivable. in conclution this story is all about eart and the venus .

7630d04,"The author thinks that people should not stop what there doing because something is dangerous and has risks. The author thinks that venus should still be studied so we can find out why its like the way it is and see if anything is on the planet. The author wants people to keep studying despite the dangers and risks.

The author talks about how scientist are trying to make things that can make it to venus and say on the planet for a while and come back. They were thinking of making a giant blimp-like spacecraft that could fly 30 miles over venus and they couls study the planet from there. They could also make a simplified electronics that are made of silicon carbide. They are wrking on ays to continue studying venus.

I agree with the author, people should not stop studying it because of the dangers and the risks. They should continue to study it so they can find out if there is anything knw about the planet that we dont know. They could figure out what there is on the planet and why the conditions are so harsh.",2

venus is actually a planet, venus sometims called the ""evening star"" in our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun. while venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

1- the umas stuydin the planet venus for more than the 3 decades numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging plante for humans to study, despite its proximity to us but the planet venus is a small and dangerous planet in the system solar because venus has a atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. on the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. these conditions imposivilite the life in this planet and are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present adittional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

2- also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even thought mercury is closer to oue sun. if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? at thirthy-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be cole to that of sea level on earth.

3- the scientist has the idea in the future visit the venus and come humans and stay living in the planet venus but how?

astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have benn the most earth-like planet in our solar system. long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth the value of returning to venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive? NASA has one particularly comeplling idea for sending humas to study venus. NASA's posiible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray...

the humas can stay in venus? the solar power would be plentiful \, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. not easy conditions, but survivable for humas

striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight t be gained on the planet itself, but also because hman curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. our travels on earth and beyound should not be limit by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovations.

bcff958,"Do you know that sometime human will not be living on Earth? Earth has limit. So we have to think about the future and implement it.

First, the author says ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star."" Before Venus is called actually a planet, Venus was not popular. Venus and it was not called anything. But after Venus had called a planet, many things have been discovering bu scientist or other. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionary the closest in distance too. It means we have a possibility to live in there. Veuns still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Again, we need to find the another place to live for the future. If we leave this problem as it is, every people will die because Earth is warming up year to year and we are on the crisis.

Secound, we have startedthe project for travel to planet which is not Earth that is easily to go. The problem and NASA have a relationship as traveling planet. NASA had done a lot of project about space. NASA also has one particulaly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. It is not easy to travel to Venus or another planet, but we have possibility because of them skill. It is survivable for humans.

Finally, the auther says,""Venus would need to get up close and parsonal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" We need to think about it. If we could live in Venus, it must be same as Earth, because there is the enviroment like this that we live. We alive. We have ocean for water, sun light, plants, oxygen, houses, foods, or something. We have to think about these problem, too.

It is not far from right now to travel to Venus and we could it, we could get a chance to live Venus. If we can, we should be more comfortable. We need to study Venus and teach many people.",3
ab0ffaa,"Have you ever read the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus. It says that there are many reasons why it was alike and how it does not seem alike Earth anymore. There are reasons of temperature the pressure on how it is not alike. They said Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and had various life forms.

How is Earth and Venus alike? In the article it said it is the planet most alike so I guess we are not that alike then. Scientists thought maybe a long time ago that Venus was like Earth. They Said that is was probably covered largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. It says that Venus has a rocky sediment surface. That includes valleys, mountians, and craters. So if Venus and Earth were alike would part of Venus be steep because of the oceans?

Venus and Earth have some major differences. It has a ninety-seven percent cabon dioxide atmosphere blanket. Which Earth's atmosphere blanket is way thinner but getting up there from all of people's realsing carbon dioxide. The cloud in Venus are highly sulfuric acid which is not good because if people lived there we would die from the acid rain and would not have any food to eat because it will also die. There would also be no water for us to drink. So no matte what we would most likely die there.

Venus and Earth have a huge temperture difference. Earth's normal temperature is like high 80 degrees Fahrenheit the low is like negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit. In Venus its average temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit. We would be burnt to death. Venus is also the hottest plant in our solar system even though it is the seconf planet from the sun. Another thing that Venus and Earth are different in is the atmosperic pressure. I do not know what Earth's atmosperic pressure is but is no where near what Venus's gets. Venus's atmosperic pressure 90 times greater than Earth's.

There are also things to think about because of Venus's high amount of everything and is the size of Earth what thing will do. Like how rapid the weather will change will have to be cautious about it changing like in a split second or will it take over years for the weather to change. I wonder what the lowest temperature will be. Does Venus have volcanos? If so how bad will it affect the people living there. We also have to think about things like earthquakes and how the building will hold together if they happen. How many time will lightning strikein like a minutes. Will Venus have enough water to with stand people and grow crops. Is it even safe to live there? What will be the days or even how long the day will last.

Scientists want to study Venus so in case Earth ever does stop working in the case rotating and obiting the sun we have somewhere close in distance to travel to. There are many dangers in traveling to Venus, but there are people out there will to risk the lifes for our future to see if we can live in other planets.

In conclusion, I do not think that we should send people to somewhere that we know is not safe. There are no many reasons why I do and do not like Venus. I also think we should send people there to see if humans can with stand all of it. My main reason I think that we should not is because of water, food, and the acid rain. I also think that it will be fun to discover another planet. I always wanted to go to Venus when I was little. I remember always arguring with my family of what planet was the sister planet of Earth I was alway right even as a little kid.",3
407f52e,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" gives many reasons on how and why humans should explore Venus despite it's many dangers. A reason that the author provided in the article on why humans should explore Venus, was that Venus use to be just like Earth. Going along with this, the author also gives ways of how humans could study and possibly live on Venus. The last big way that the author shows on why humans should push torwards studying Venus, was that discovering Venus would allow humans to ""meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" In this article the author provides many ways of how and why humans should study and explore Venus despite it's dangers.

In paragraph 4 the author provides information from astronomers saying that Venus use to be just like Earth. In this paragraph the author states that Venus use to be covered with large oceans and could have also supported various forms of life. The author also states many other facts on how Venus use to be like Earth. Venus use to have many features that where very close to Earth. Venus use to have many valleys, mountains, and craters. In this article it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". With these many facts about Venus the author also says that one day humans may be able to even live on Venus.

A huge reason why the author thinks that Venus is worth exploring is because one day this planet could be habitable for humans. In paragraph 5 the author provides information on how humans could live on Venus. The author states that the way humans could live on Venus would be by floating above all of the harsh conditions on Venus's ground. By hovering at about 30 or so miles above Venus's landscape humans would be able to avoid all of the planets dangerous conditions. An example of this theory that the author provided in the article was that ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many stroms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfreindly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way"".

The most important reason that the author thinks that humans should study and maybe even live on Venus is becuse the oppurtunites it would open up for humans. In the last paragraph, paragraph 8, the author provides many reasons on why discovering and living on Venus would be so extravigant. In this last paragraph the author states that by studying and living on Venus it would allow humans to ""meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This quote from the article shows just how great it could be for humans to take the time and effort to study Venus.

In the article the author shows that studying and possibly living on Venus would be worth taking on the dangers of Venus. The author even provides many ways on how humans could avoid those dangers. These facts that the author provides supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. This is easily true because the author even goes ahead and shows why we should at least try to learn as much as we can about Venus. Overall the author supports the idea of living on Venus and doing as much research on the plant because scientists have come up with many safe ways of doing it.",4
