fc76be4,"germany,paris,columbia and now the usa have begun to cut back ob their vehichle emmissions. why?

To reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced by their countries.

no cars in germany? vaubaun germany is a new upscale community on the edge of the french and swiss border. recently completed in 2006 whats so special you might ask?

theres little no no cars in this new community.

according to the article ""

in german suburb, life goes on with out cars

"" written by: elisabeth rosenthanl.

""70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""

thsi effort is being used to try and reduce the 12 pecent of green house gas prouced by europ alone.

in vauban people crowd the sidwalks, kis playing in the streets, and the people that do want to own a car have to pay a cool $40,000.00. and there cars are not even kept in their houses.

in another european country close by, paris is also trying to cut down its green house gas emisoms.

in the article ""

paris bans driving due to smog

"" it tells how france is also taking action to reduce its green house gases.

the article reads ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforces a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

anyone who had an odd numberd tag on one of the days and was cought driving would  get a $31 ticket. and revers for the even numberd tags on the next day. so the cars took turns driving. meaning there would be less cars on the street on those certain days.

according to the article over 4,000 people were fined, and 27 people had their cars impounded. it might sound stupid but whe your trying to save the world its a small price to pay.

bogota columbia also joins the fight against greenhouse gases.

car free day spinning into a big hit in bogota

"" by Andrew selsky tells the story of just one day that people in bogota neglected to use cars.

"" millions of colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. it was the third straight year cars have been banned and taxis permitted for the days without cars in this capital city of 7 million. the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. violators faced $25 fines.""

bogota columbia has been doing this now for over 3 years, meaning that they are actually cutting down on there green house gas emissions.

Vauban's streets in germany are completely ""car free."" People who do not drive cars any more and ride bikes, walks or rides the tram are said to be more happier this way. A mother of two walks and rides her bikes every where with her kids and does not feel as tense and stressed as she did when she was driving.

Also a huge advantage is it drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Diesel fuel was banned in France since tax policies favored dieselover gasoline. Delivery companiess complained of lost revenue, but exceptions were made, plug-in-cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers.

In Paris there were days of near record pollution, so they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below average and equal to the country in January 1995. ""The rate of car ownership per household and per person came down two to three years before the downturn."" Michael Sivak stated. New York has a new bike sharing program and the skyrocketing bridges and tunnel tolls reflect people to want to not drive cars anymore.

A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, just shows you that the beneficial implications, environment and easier way of saving money does make people want to start biking, walking, using a tram, etc. Those examples I gave you are a few advantages of limiting car use.         ",2,0,0.8096966743469238
eee008f,"Cars are a very large help for transportation. Although they do have alot of defects to our environment, our laziness, and our safety.

The first reason we should limit car use is so our environment doesn't get ruined.  The fumes our vehicles are relasing into the air are creating a large addition to the greeenhouse gases.  For an example semis, diesel cars, diesel trucks and other vehicles when you rev the gas it pours out black smoke into the environment.  When you see a truck do this you think nothing of it, but overtime and with every single car and truck that does it, it adds up very quickley.

Another reason we should limit our car usuage is because it increases our laziness.  Instead of driving to school when it's only 2 minutes away, you could just walk.  If you walked you would lose a little weight and even saving your gas money.  If you are close to the place you want to go then you might as well just walk in benfits you in many ways.  Saving money, losing weight, and getting more fit.

One of the most important reasons we should limit our car usuage is for our own safety.  Deaths in car accidents is one of the most leading causes to death now a days. would you rather walk or ride a bike to the location you want to go or would you rather risk your life by driving and somebody teboning you and injuring or even killing you.  Not that you should but some people sometimes can get into a crash with you and then just drive off. Whether it was your fault or theirs now you have to pay for the damages done to your vehicle.

If you are going to drive because you live far away from everything.  Simply car pull, it's alot easier and if everyone throws down a little money then you aren't spending that much on gas or diesel.  Riding a bike is a great solution to limiting car usuage because it's a one time purchase, once you buy the bike you don't have to pay for fuel.  Also it's better than walking because it's by far faster.

In general driving has advantages and disadvantages.  Although if you are close to your location then riding a bike would be ideal to lower car usuage.    ",2,0,0.7981201410293579

But why drive a car and sit there for up to thirty minutes in traffic when you can walk there in under ten or ride a bike in just under five, now if that sounds like great logic to you then great; if you are like the majority of people in this current day and age then you would not need to feel the erdge to drive, you would rather ride a bike and feel the breeze of the fresh crisp air in your hair.

The new trend of living is here, more and more communities are popping up that are car free. As the first source has stated ""...70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" more and more people are deciding to not own a car or even to just sell their cars so that way it is not a burden on their shoulders to maintain the cars. Most of the people who decide to give up their cars say it's a much happier way to live.

Some countries are even putting a ban on driving on certain days like paris did in source two. It stated that ""...motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine."" This ban went on for roughly five days for the smog cleared enough for all to resume preferd ways of transportation.

Auto-moblie causes a large percent of greenhouse gas emissions as stated in source 1, paragraph 5. Limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than half. Car pollution can also can aslo cause smog which aslo took a toll on Paris , who had to ban driving do to smog .Due to the smog delivery companies lost revenue and public transit was free of charge for a couple of days. Smog can also travel easily to other cities throughout the air. Also car usage has taken a toll on previous bills in the united states as stted in source 1 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only the other 20 percent to other transport.

Limitng car usage can greatly reduce the number of traffic jams throughout cities. As staed in souce 4. During Bogata car-free day parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

In several places around the world citizens are cutting down, or off,with their car usage  and starting to transport themselves by bycicle or walking.  Vauban, Paris and Bogota residents have described this new way of living as stress-reducing and has also been a domino effect for places around the world!

The first point, described by previous car owners in Vauban, Germany is the lack of stress in their life after the conversion to a no-car lifestyle. ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Citizen Heidrun Walter described the change as positive even while juggling her full-time jobs of being a media trainer and mom.  The loss of time spent in traffic has produced a more relaxed lifestyle in Bogota, Colombia as well.  Carlos Arturo Plaza, citizen, explains that the switch as ""A good opportunity to take away stress."" As a whole, nobody likes to sit in traffic and walking or riding a bicycle to work makes one less thing you have to worry about.

Having citizens convert into not using automobiles full time also produces the domino effect. For example, because of Bogota using this lifestyle the Colobian cities of Cali and Valledupar have followed in their lead. As well as the obvious that this change brings, is also is shedding off on other places that want to improve their surroundings.  With other cities, countys or even countries joining in, we can slowly make the world a healthier place.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has brought positive effects on the cities of Vauban, Paris and Bogota. These places have shown signs of lower stress and an easier way of life.  Many other places have been adding on to the trend and can make the world a much less polluted and better place to be.                                            ",3,0,0.7051433324813843

Its hurting our world and the people around who are around it. Their are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage around the world. Many people think its no good side to not driving around everywhere but their are. Stores are becoming closer to walking distance. It stops cars from poluting the world and it lessons stress from the human body.

Everywhere you look you see a store or a building. We drive to places because we think its to far a walk or its a bad day to walk. In the Article ""In German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars""  it says that in Vauban,Germany they built stores that were a good walking distance on a main street instead on a long far away highway. So that means the stores are closer to you,which is good because you can go alot more often if they are closer and easy to get to. Another advantage to that is that its faster to walk if they bring the stores closer to you. This is some of the advantages to limiting car usage.

Cars are polluting our world everyday and everynight night somebody wants to drive. In the aritcle ""paris bans driving due to fog"" it says that Paris had to force people to leave their cars at home or they would have to pay a fine if they drive it. It says that it was intense smog. Cars cause alot of damage to the world but people who drive dont see how it's effecting the world. The Smog caused alot of traffic to happen and that most likely caused car accidents to happen. Instead of driving if you walk it helps you not worry about gas prices or anything that you worry about that is related to driving so it relieves stress.

All in all limiting car driving is the way to go. It improves the walking distance to and from the stores. It helps the world from being polluted and relieves stress from your body. Why would'nt you want that for yourself and your family.    ",3,0,0.7783907651901245

For example, limiting car use can lead to a cleaner environment, better overall health of the people and the Earth, and overall, just a better place to live. Cutting down on car usage can be very benficial for the planet, along with future generations of people.

First, limiting car use can lead to a better place to live in. If we were to slow down on the use of gas, there would be less wars over oil in other countries. We as a race can change the world, one car at a time. Lowering the amount of driving wouldn't be an easy change, but surely one worth while.

Secondly, giving up cars completely might not be necessary, but emitting toxic gas fumes can be easily avoided simply by switching to an electric car. There are many affordable electric cars that can help stop the fumes from traveling into the ozone layer, which can prolong our Earth's life, our lives, and can stop global warming dead in its tracks. Who doesn't want to keep this wonderful weather?

Lastly, cutting down on driving automobiles might have an effect  on saving people from car accidents caused by unfit drivers. Thousands of people die every day from unnecessary car usage. If we were to cut the amount of driving in half, the rate of death due to car accidents would find a steep decline.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can make the world a better place. This decision can lead to better health, less death due to car accidents, prolonging our planet's health, and less complaints about those roller-coaster like gas prices! It only takes one person to make a change, so decide if you want to be the one to potentially save the world.    ",3,0,0.7909018397331238
767cfeb,"As the years go by there had seemed to be more and more polution in the world. Most of that polution had been seen to be produced by cars, which some people wouldn't know how to live without. However, studies have shown that some cities around the world have actually decreased the usage of cars. A city that has virtually no cars would be Vauban, Germany, and other cities such as Paris, France, Bogota, Colombia, and even some in the United States have joined in the decreasing of car use wagan. In turn of not using cars as much the polution has gone down in those cities.

To begin with, Vauban, Germany, in this German city "" Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban's streets are completely 'car-free'-- except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park -- large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""( P2, In German Suburn, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal) And in Paris, "" After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters ... [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.""(P10-13, Paris bans driving due to smog, Robert Duffer) That might seem a little bit harsh to some people but in turn "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog ...(P14, Paris bans driving due to smog, Robert Duffer)

Then there's Bogota, Colombia, where, "" In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced $25 fines. The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped accasional rain showers on Bogota."" (P20-22, Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky) This is a pretty good sign from Colombia, showing that it's being consistant with it's program and not stopping despite the rain. Also, now even the United States is using less cars, "" America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an invesment research comany. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" (P 32, The End of Car Culture, Elisabeth Rosenthal)

To conclude, it's great that more and more cities are pitching in to reduce polution due to cars. There are great advantages coming from the reduction of car usage, the best being less polution and smog. If more cities join in and the current cities keep doing what they are doing there could possibly be an even more dramatic decrease in the polution produced today.    ",3,0,0.6887158751487732

Studies show that people are less stressed without cars, there is less greenhouse gases in the atmoshere, and lower smog.

We probably would not think that limiting our car usage and walking more would make us less stressed. It's true a city in Germany has gone car free. They did a survey on everybody in town and they all say that it has reduced there stress. You are always stressed while you are driving, worried you are going to crash into someone, worried someone will crash into you. Everyone would be happier if we just got rid of cars.

Another benefit about limiting car usage is that there is less greenhouse gases going into the atmoshere. Scientists did a study if we did not use cars the temperature would be three to four degrease cooler in the summer. So just think when the temperature is in the 90's you are going to want that four degrease difference. Cars are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gases here in the united states. The greenhouse gases slowly eat away at the ozone layer making it thinner and thinner, that's what is making the temperature hotter and hotter.

These are all reasons why it would benefit to get rid of cars. It wouldnt kill you to walk a few blocks to work. by doing that you would be putting less stress on you and limiting the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.     ",3,0,0.8126806020736694

Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecissary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehical. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states,"" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters."" Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the envirnment dramtically. Because of the ussage of cars the envinment has been hugely effected. Since the envirnment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while excepltions were made for plug-in cars."" Not only is pollution affecting the envirnment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increse rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess envinments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the envirnment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the envirnment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe envirnment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe envirnment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase.

One of the biggest examples is polution, also the removal of cars would ultimatley lead to a finacial increase in our economy, lastly making this change positivley effects our future.

First I would like to talk about a huge problem we face as a society today and that is green house gasses. You may not think that these are a big deal put if left unchecked they caan become a huge problem. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisions in europe, and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas. This can become a huge problem ranging from acid rain to climate change. An example of what polution can do to a city is in paris they are putting a partial ban on cars because of how how bad there polution is. There was a huge smog problem because green house gasses were being trapped because of hot days and cold nights.

Also this change can have amazing effects on that areas economy. Because there will be no cars people will take the bus witch is less than payinf for gas or they can walk to closer places. Also gas prices would decrease for other forms of tranpertation because there wouldnt be cars demanding the fuel. family could sell there cars and spend the money they were using to fund there car other thing witch will lead to the people being happier. Also the removal of cars will lead to teh creation of jobd because they will need people to operate public transportation.

Lastly the removal of cars will have a postive effect on the future of our world. With the track were on now the world is estimated to heat up and have negative consequences on our society. these climate changes may seem small but they can have drastic effects. in china there is a lake that is so polluted you set the top of it on fire because there is so much polutants on it. also this chang has coralation with peoples happiness.

First of all, cars are bad for the environment.  They pollute our atmosphere everyday and we never notice it.  Well the certainly noticed it in Paris when they had near-record pollution after several days.  So Paris put a ban on driving to reduce smog.  This was a great idea with an even better result.  They reduced congestion by 60 percent.  What the French did was allow cars with an odd numbered license plate to drive one day, and the even numbered license plate cars on another.  Also, in Bogota, Colombia they have a program that bans cars for one day.  Only allowing buses and taxis being permitted for the day.  It is also a good way to relieve stress as shown in this quote from the third source.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"".  This ban on cars is apart of a improvement campaign that started in the 1990s.  It has worked well for Bogota and is now beging to spread to other cities in Clombia.  This campaign has resulted in the construction of many miles of bike path and parks.  This campaign has a very bright futurer and hopefully will spread to other countries and allow us to lower pollution in our atmosphere.

In addition,  Their are places thta have already done away with cars in their communities.  Such as Vauban, Germany.  The streets of Vauban are completly car free. And people are even selling their cars to move to this quant little town.  As shown in this quote from Source one ""70 percent of Vaubans families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""  Can you believe that?

People are willing to sell their cars to live a town.  Well they have good reason too.  People who moved to this town have said with cars they were tense.  But now that they have sold their car they are much happeir.  This is one of the more appealing advantages of limiting car usage, your own happiness. Finally,  America is also trying to play a role in cutting down on car usage.  Trying to promote car reduced communities throughout America.  These communities will help very much to reduce polluntion and strengthen our atmoshere.

In conclusion, Their are many advantages to limiting car usage.  But it all depends on what we do ourselves to help.  So next time you are going some where just remeber, their is always anothe way to get to your destination.                                    ",4,0,0.843261182308197

The author of source one, states in pargraph 8 that ""..some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like not only in developed countries, but also in the developing world, where emissons from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities""  All authors state that limiting car usage, is a great way to reduce air pollution. Paragraph 10, of source two, states that ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" If car usuage was limited in cities there would be less smog, and pollution in the air. Not only would it be better for the enviroment, it would also be better for your health.

Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving wrecklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.

Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing; less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, ""...in attempts to make suburbs more compact..."" Source one, also states that ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway. (paragraph 6)"" Getting to these places will become safer for everyone.

As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful enviroment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.             ",4,0,0.8224649429321289
951e252,"The laws have changed. We now have days where we cannot use our cars for the day. We can only get around using buses, a local taxi, bikes, walk etc,. Would this benefit us or would it not? Some cities and countries around the world are banning cars. Instead they would like to use public transportation, a biciylce, or maybe your own two feet to get around. I believe that this topic is reasonable and I agree.

The United States is considering this law of not having to use our cars for a day or two each week so we can get out in the fresh air or try out some new transportation for personal knowledge of more ways to get around. The paper, The End of Car Culture, states that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Assuming, we are already shifting into a lifestyle of not having a car for a day or two. To me, this would benefit the country because of our high obesity rate. If more people ride their bikes to places or walk places, this will give them more exercise opportunities and help them lose weight in a more constructive way. Just riding your bike or walking a mile to the grocery store a day can definitely help someone out.

Speaking of helping things out, how about the environment? The article, Paris band driving due to smog, states that ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Robert Duffer also states that Paris uses Mondays to be deicated ro even-numbered license plates are ordered to leave their cars at home and the next day odd-numbered license plates were ordered to keep their cars home. The diesel fuel in Paris was hurting the environment so that is why they banned cars. Here in the United States I believe that the car pollution is also hurting our environment. Riding bikes and walking places is a good activity for everyone to do.

Most of us, except the 2% of people in America, have trouble with money. Riding bikes around and walking to a friends house or to the store, would definitely help our money situations. Not having a car two days a week means we do not have to get gas as much, which would save us money. Using a taxi would be useful too but, not as much becuase the money adds up also. Not using cars can completely help our community and country in so many ways.

Banning cars for a day or two sounds like a fantastic idea. Being able to go out and get fresh air and get some exercise would be great for our country. Less pollutions, less money and more constructive activities for getting around to places. All sounds like a good idea to me. Let's see if the United States takes action.                     ",4,0,0.7403564453125
a22d402,"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city and/or regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a time-consuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almost-broken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semi-trucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashes/accidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bike-sharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridge/tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our number-one priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work; taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds; or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it's not the destination that yiou should look forward to; it's the journey.    ",5,0,0.80524742603302
a6d0dda,"Fresh clean air, spotless streets and no car accidents. Welcome to Vauban, Germany.  The 5,500 people of this town are a part of something that this day and age has never seen.  The residents here have given up their cars, and are a part of an experiment where their streets are completely ""car-free""!

After this experiment started in Germany, it's population would agree that the tense-ness they were feeling with their cars is now gone.  This new way of living was started in 2006 and other countries would agree that it is a smart move and an affordble way of living.  The residents of Vauban have more money to spend on other necessities such as clothing and food, or maybe some entertainment, even.  All of their monthly car payments and gasoline bills have ceased to exist because they simply have no reason to pay the prices anymore without a car.  Citizens of this little town don't have to walk (or ride their bikes) far because the city has thought this movement out very well.  All of the stores are placed just a walk away rather than their malls being placed on a distant highway.  Public transportation has become more accessible and there is more space for side-walks rather than roads. For some, this is a dream town for them and their children. There isn't much of a worry about air polution or accidents.

If you were to compare Vauban's air pollution to Bejing's the difference would be austounding.  Just last night, NBC Nightly News showed the city of Bejing where the smog was so dense that visibility was reduced to almost none.  The majority of the population won't go outside with out wearing a mask to protect them selves.  All of the air pollutants could be harming us even with a potential risk of lung cancer.  The mayor of Bejing has even made a statement talking about his city's air, and the risk and threat it poses to his residents.  Even the common person will recognize that the gas emissions from a car's tail pipe equals pollution.  Paris officials knew this too, and understood that their city had an air cleanliness issue.  So, in an effort to make the City of Love more pleaseable they limited what cars could drive on what days.  They enforced a partial driving ban to clear the smog in the city.  For a short amount of time only even-numbered cars, for example, could drive on a Monday.  If odd numbered cars were on the street then there would be a 22 Euro fine (that equals 31 USD's).  After 5 days, car traffic and conjestion was down around 60% on the streets, and the air pollution started clearing.

Fatal crashes are among the one of the third highest risks for all American's.  Some states have even made it a law to not text and drive, and in some states there probably is a ""no talking on the cell phone law"" too!  If the number of cars are reduced -or taken away all together- I feel that the lives of the American people are less at risk.  Every day, and not just in this country, hundreds of people are injuring them selves or getting killed by distracted driving, hit-and-runs, and driving under the influence.  It could be beneficial to cut down the car usage and up the number of public transportation avaible to the public.

In any major city you go to in the United States, all around you, you can notice the large amounts of people walking to where they need to go.  In Washington D.C. bike rentals are

EVERYWHERE.  And if you don't want to take a bike then take the D.C. Metro.  The same will go for New York City or anywhere with a large population of people.  You will also notice that city folk tend to be slimmer than others.  That is most likley due to the fact that they walk everywhere.  Just like I mentioned before, like Vauban, eveything in a major city is usually within walking distance.  As we all know, walking is a form of excersize and it is recomemnded by health officials that each person should get at least 1 hour every day and it is very believeable that a city go-er gets plenty more than the recomended.  The first lady has started a program for children in an effort to get them moving, fit and healthy as well. Some children in New York City won't even drive a single day in their lives- or worry about what could happen if they do.  Also, the Capital of Colombia-Bogota- has organized a day for it's residence to avoid taking their car.  It is called the Day Without Cars and the major goal is to reduce smog and promote walking.

All in all.. Cars, the most dangerous driving force in our daily lives, should be cut back on.  Even with study after study coming out and proving just how danger and non-beneficial to our health they are, they are slowly losing populatiry.  If this pattern stays consistant then sociologists say that it will have great effects on the atmosphere, and our healthy lives that we all live.     ",5,0,0.7030672430992126
4b037f4,"From the small town of Cocoa, Florida, to the busy streets of Beijing, China, driving cars is a global phenomenon. It could be said that reducing the use of cars is beneficiary to the human population. Although, some believe that the negative effects of limiting automobile usage will surely outweigh the positive outcomes. The superior argument, however, is overall, less vehicle use.

Limiting car use would be an improvement to society on a global scale. According to source 1, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This shows that the the excessive use of transportation harms the ozone layer. Even at 12 percent, the percentage will gradually increase and later will become an even more significant threat to Earth's atmoshere. According to source 4, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants. If the numbers were reduced, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. This would cause less pollution and more breathable air in the long run. The world we share will become uninhabitable if we continue in these environmental patterns.

Furthermore, there is more justification for the advantages of limiting car usage. According the source 2, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. This was due to the fact that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air five days before. The amount of time it took to air out smog that rivaled Beijing,China is an impressive factor of being fuel efficient. According the source 3, Bogota Columbia has a program where, for a day, you go around town car-free. It is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city. Not only does the environment become more habitable, but your physical health is improved as well.

However, some would argue that limiting vehicle use is not the route to go. According to source 2, when the Paris driving ban was enforced, delivery companies complained of lost profit. This is not completeley true since plug-in cars, hybrids, and other earth-friendly cars were unaffected by the Parisian ban. Car companies will still be in business because of the use of green cars instead of foosil fuel-powered automobiles. According to source 4, demographic research has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. This may harm the next generation as they become more dependent on alternative methods of traveling. It does not mean, however, that they won't have similar efficiency of speed and reliability with different transportations as they would now. The goverenment will have more money from public transportation to improve upon the community, and greener way. of traveling, like walking or bike riding, will create stronger immune systems and keep the majority of the population in healthy physical shape. The argument of the disadvantages of limiting car usage is somewhat counterproductive, as shown in this paragraph.

Cars, one of the less significant necessities of a well functioning society, will continue to be used. Children, teens, and adults alike will all be affected by the results of driving. We do require a method of convienient transportation for daily occurences, however, there is an extent over how much driving is sufficient to continue our everyday lives. Whatever an individual's decision may be, the amount of car usage will determine the living conditions on Earth for generations to come.    ",6,0,0.8072234392166138
