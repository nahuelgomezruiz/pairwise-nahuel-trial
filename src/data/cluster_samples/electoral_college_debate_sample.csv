So in this essay I'm going to tell you what all happens in the court system such as how presidents get choosen, thus the time that presidents are choosen. Also i will be tellingwhat else there is in the government

In the united States we have a president and how president is in charge of the country and what happens. He or she is in charge of what happens in other countries that can deal or harm us. So far in history we have had 44 presidents. Some presidents have done a lot more for this country then others have. Presidents are choosen every four years by voting. The people that live in the country vote out of dozens of peopel who nomenate themself as president. Then they narrow down to 2 people and they count the votes frrom there and that is how the presidents get choosen

There are other people in the government other then the president. There are poilical parties. Also canadates. they both have differnent jobs in the court system. They arent as high up in the court system as then president is but thery help the president in what they do.                                    ",1,5,0.4541314244270324

Two guys named Rich, Jummy carter, Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO and they are not alone according to Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. The single best argument agianst the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election would be thrown to the house or Representatives, where state delegations vote to the presdient. Because each state casts only one vote to give th voters vote to the president and another for the congress,

The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the wall of the people, And if an electoral tie seems unlikely. A the base level the electoral colloege is unfair to voters.

I think we should keep the Electoral College because it gives the people opportunities to vote for electors and presidents. If we vote for popular votes then that doesnt mean people truly know what president they want to run their country. When we vote we are actually choosing our electors when we vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Some people think that the Electoral College was unfair back-then but what about now. Over seventeen sates did not see the candidates at all,Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. When you vote for a presidental candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College. One reason is certainty of outcome,Two Everyone's President, Three Swing States, Four Big States, and yet but not least Five Avoid Run-Off Elections. These are all practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Now in my case that is wrong because wether you vote or not everyone person should have the right to see what the president is doing to their country. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-democrats in Texas, for example,or Republicans in California. Each party selects a slate os electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an person or thing in the past that cannot fit in the present. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.                                                                                                                            ",2,5,0.8553133010864258
f4f3ff2,"The Electoral College is a compromise between the election of the President by electoral votes. This has been around for as long as I can remember. It plays a very big part in our government.  Some people want to get rid of it. Others don't. Do you think we should keep the it?

The Electoral College balances out the amount of popular votes. If both candidates are tied, we turn to the state electors. The candidate that has the biggest amount of electoral votes wins. One candidate can have more popular votes and very few electoral votes. The popular votes are just for the state electors to decide which they are going to pick. In the end it all goes down to them, The Electoral College,

On the other hand, some people don't like this idea. The electors are sometimes depend on the state. Other times the state conventions, the presidential candidates, and sometimes the sate party's central committee. Voters think it's unfair. They spend a bunch of time voting for who THEY want, but in the end it comes down to the electors. So in reality it doesn't even matter who the voters choose. They really just choose a slate of electors, who then elect the president,

I know the Electoral College was established by our fouding fathers, but it is time to tart with something new and for something new to be established. I would honestly choose the popular vote because it also puts a suspence on people about who will win.

State Senator,

I argue in the favor of keeping the electoral college. I think that it really doesn't matter what a single person vote can do. One vote will not make a difference. The state uses the americans vote, to see what we would pefer. Every vote an



important

' person makes, it counts that.

I personally think its a waist of time to vote,that us americans really have no say so in. I bet that if we all didn't vote this next go around, we would still have a president. All because, of what the

' people want. All 538 electors know who is better for the United States of America. So, why we vote?

The only thing against the electoral college, is what we might call the

Disaster Factor.

Back, in 1960, segregationist, in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with the new electors who would oppese John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be {overruled} by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing the the electoral college method id not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president. NOT the people. When you cote for a presidential candidate you're actaully voting for a slate of electos. So, you might as well just let the electoral collge do the job. I mean if you want to go and vote mor power to you. But, like I said its a waist of time to do so!!!

In my opinoin I think we should absolutely keep the Electoral College system. I think we should keep the way we elect our presidents because it's a non-democrac way. It's also easy and fast by killing two birds with one stone. Our founding fathers compromised the Electoral system and since we can't get rid of our admendments and change the Constitution I don't tink we should get rid of the Electoral College system. It may be old, but new things aren't always the best things. I think if the Goverment wanted to change it they should try it on a state first before they roll it to the rest of the nation, and we all know the goverment isn't that smart and won't do it because we are their test animals.

Another reason to keep the Elctoral system is because it's easy and effciant. If we just have the elction just be based off votes and not popular party it would be messy. The Electoral College System allows certainity of outcome. No run-off election because mostly likely there will be no tie. No arguing about the president being from a certain place or region so that state favors the president. Winner-takes-all system allows the people to pay close attention to the election. Swing states allow a little excitement during the election because some states like Florida you don't know which way they are going to go.  Big states also like Florida gets the president on the edge because the can loose every small state and still win with the big ones.

270 votes are not a lot of votes to win an elction with, but every vote counts. Some people may not vote because there are only two parties that most of the nation only cares about the Republicans and the Democrats. Some people dont like tovote in fear of their party not winning due to its unpopularity. But everyone should vote to express there politcal power. That's why we should keep it because if we change it we're changing our minds in the way vote.    ",3,5,0.8778190612792969

People have voices and the popular vote can be biased from state to state. The proccess if mature because they chose unbiased electors, and there is a majority of 270 electoral votes. The Electoral College has 538 electors, which gives a good amount of unbiases people. They figure this amount by one for each member in the House of Representaties plus two for the Senators, which you could be one.

The Electoral College is one of the best ways to keep a fair election. We people do not make the brightest decisions sometimes, and the Electoral College keeps us from making the wrong decision for who is going to be our next president.

People can be easily affected into turning on a candidate. They could not realize that the candidate would be a great president. The Electoral College gives the candidates a fair chance. The member of the Electoral College are fair and know what is best for the country. The specific Electoral electors for your state vote what the state wants, and is not biased on what other senators or electors want. This gives the people a good amount of say in the election.

Electoral Colllege keeps the people in line and gives the people a sense of establishment. The election of the president is every four years. This gives people time to decide on a new president and who they want representing their votes. Overall the Electoral College is one of the brightest decisions that America has made. For one the Electoral College gives people a fair chance in becoming president. Also the Electoral College helps make the voting process a lot easier.

America is a country of opppurtunity. And many people come to this country to escape or change their harsh living style. When the founding father created the consitution.

But now it is a way for people with a big pocket, to get there say, in who get to be president. In source 2: the readers are told that over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election. What this tells the readers is, americans don't feel like their vote actually counts towards the election anymore.

Now people are starting to wonder, Whats wrong with the Electoral college? The answer to that questions is, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. To any american looking at this process happening and knowing their vote doesnt really matter. would feel like an injustise has been done to them, and they are absolutlly right.

The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.

Second off, but each party, selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet it happens rarely. Also there are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or coservative reasons.

Thirdly, a dispute over the outcomes of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dipute over the popular vote. The reason is the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. in [ 2012's] election, for example obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because almost all staes award electoral votes on a winner-take-all-basis, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide of electoral-vote victory in theat state.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the problem of election in which no candidates recives a majority of votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoal votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presendential elections process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

Americans fought the Revolutionary War to give us the right to choose our leaders, and if the Electoral College chooses the president, then we do not get much of the right that was fought for in the 1770's. If Americans don't get to choose the president that they want, then what's the point of voting? The answer is: there is no point, if the Electoral College votes the candidates instead.

The citizens of America chooses the Electors to represent their state. Then the Electors vote for the president. It seems simple, but what happens when the states are not properly represented, i. e. the electors do not vote for the candidate they were suppposed to? Why does the system still exist, but is majorly flawed? For one, it's confusing, two, it's a not practical, and three, it does not properly represent the states they are from.

Some might say that the Electoral College is an easier method to count the votes, maybe so, maybe not. It all depends on how the votes are counted. If they are counted by hand, then yes, it is a whole lot easier. If the polls are electronic, then there would be no difference, because the computer would do all the counting for you. It is also more efficient as to what the people really want rather than the Electoral College.

The Electoral College should be done away with, finished, no more. The American people need to vote to abolish the Electoral College, with no one voting for them this time. That way, the American people can finally be represented without any barriers interrupting them.    ",3,5,0.810772180557251

We have to do it because The Electoral collage it's failed to elect a President , the masses (the people) don't get to pick the president, and its outdated.

Firstly, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it has failed to elect a President in the past. In the case of a tie in electoral votes it would be the task of the house of representatives the elect a president and the way they elect the presidnt is worse then the electoral collage. even thought and exact tie in the predidental elections has not occored so the catostrify of the house of representatives electing the presisdent has not happen yet ,but it is entirly  possible.

Secondly, we need to abolissh the Electoral collage because the masses (the people) don't get to the president. In the  electoral collage usage of the system resalts in the

People electing the electors ,to elect the president. And in this system the eletors can pull a switcharoo and vote for the other canadent if they so please, to betray the people by doing so. allthought its system has worked scince the founding of our country ,it is still quirky and disfunctionable at times. the electoral collage allows the electors to do as they please if a elector for florida promises to pick one president and gets all the votes to got to the electoral collage he can choose the Other canadent because his freind wanted him to. how stupid is that!

Thirdly, we need to abloish the electoral collage because it is outdated. in our day and time we have smart phones and aindroids that we can use to vote for the president in the peoples choice. there could be a web site that you can go on to submit your election and at the end of the election the compuster can tally us the number of votes to the exact amount so it would be the peoples choice. its  also outdated becouse we dont need one or a few guys to be sent somewhere to cast the vote of the people , we have so mmusch advanced technology that we can have any legal person who wants to vote can and actually have there vote matter insted of what the elector pick so it matters to those few poeple instead of every single person in america.

In conclusion, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it can fail to elect a president(which is almost did in 1960), the masses (the people) can't elect the president(they have to elect the electers to elect the president, and also is is very outdated. in my opion, we should also consiter tweking the electoral callage instead of just getting rid of it.                                                                                                  ",4,5,0.7630883455276489
269e81f,"Dear Mr. President,

As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first admendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a ""popular"" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Best-laid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the ""priveledge"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted canidate A, but North Dakota voted for canidate B, canidate A is bound to win because Florida has twenty-nine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first canidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised?

17c5f94,"Dear State Sentator,

A lot of chatter about weather the president should be elected by electoral college or by popular vote is going around my school for the past couple of weeks, and i can't help but to give my own opinion about this argument. I believe that the popular vote should descide who is the president.

I believe this because of two reasons. One, the citizens are the ones that are going to have to deal with this good or bad president for four years and possibly eight years. Also the satate senators can be bribed by one or the other candidates running for president. This candidate could have the worst plans for the next four years and all because he cheated to win. This could cause riots and uprawrs around the United States.

Two, Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system. What this means is that candidates are not going to focus on the staes that they know they wont get any votes from. for example in source tw, during the campain of 2000, sevebnteen states were not visited by either candidates so they didn't get to see any campain ads. this is unfair because it makes it harder, alomost impossible for these states to choose on who to vote for because they had no presentations to choose from. this puts to much power in the candidates hands.

Some may believe otherwise. For example, since the Electoral votes are from very experienced people that have put there life and time into knowing about what is right and wrong. they are much more experience than the normal citizens. Also Electoral College prevents run-off elections to occur. for example in source three, the electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes casted. This causes lots of pressure which would greaatly complicate the presidential election process. With Electoral Collage, this produces a clear winner.

In my own opinion the one that decideds the winner is popular votes. There can still be Elector Collage votes, but the Electoral votes have to much power and is unfair to the citizens of the united states.    ",4,5,0.8587196469306946

Many argue that the electoral college should be abolished and others feel that we should elect by popular vote. I strongly believe that we should change to popular vote because the electors could defy peoples will, they are unfair to voters, and people arent necessarily voting for their president.

To begin with, the electors have the power to defy peoples will. State legistlaters are responsible for picking electors and those electors can defy the will of people. ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding for whomever they please."" said Bradford Plumer .This is not right because the legislatures are picking electors that are using their powers for the worst.

Next,the electoral college is unfair to the voters. "" Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state,candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" said Plumer. For example , during the 2000 campaign only 17 states didnt see the candidatesat all, that includes Rhode Island and South Carolina. Electoral colleges are not being fair to the states and their voters.

Lastly, the election process should be changed to popular vote because voters are necessarily voting for the president. Most people think that when they go to vote for their president that their votes are what decides the final outcome, but thats not true!.Its the electoral college that decides that. Some people dont vote for that reason , because they dont think that their vote will change anything. And in the end it does not seem very fair that are votes count by very little.

In conclusion, the way we elect are president every four years should be changed. It should go based on popular vote not on electoral college because elector could defy people, they are unfair to voters , and people arent necessarily voting for their president. For all the reason people should be able to vote and they will know that their vote will be counted.         ",4,5,0.8475327491760254
df3f185,"Dear Mr. Senator,

The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,"" states the article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

To begin with, the Electoral College is the cause for many issues in our nation's presidential campaign. First of all, voters sometimes cannot even control whom their electors vote for. Ergo, one may vote for an elector of our favorite candidate's party, however, we don't know if that elector will go back on his word and vote for another cadidate. The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. Aside from that, their is the worrying aspect of a tie occurring. If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. The article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41, 971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii had voted the other way"". This says that if those people had just voted for the opposite person, then there would have been a tie between the two candidates. Yes, those numbers seem large, but in comparison to the number of voters that there were in those years, they're a small fraction of them. This shows how close elections are with the Electoral College.

Aside from causing issues in the United States, the Electoral College is extremely unfair to voters. The article, ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state; they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit ""swing"" states. ""Swing"" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. '

To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, ""The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!""    ",5,5,0.8768262267112732

I believe that we should change the electoral college to election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The electoral college is in no way fit to be the basis of how we choose the president of the United States. This country was based of of popular soverignty and we should keep it the way that it always has been with all the decison makeing done be the people.

The electoral college is an overwhemingly unfair system to voters. The canidents will not spend any of their time in states they know will not win because of the winner take all system in each state. they only focus on the tight races and some of the states dont even get to see the campaign ads. Some of the states did not even see the candidates at all. The electoral college is essentially one of the most unfair things in the prospect that the candidates dont spend time in the states that they dont think will win and the states that they know wont win are not even privillaged enough to see the campaign ads.

In addition to being unfair the electoral college can cause serious damage. The electoral college have the power to go against the will of the people. Back in the '60s segregationists in the Louisiana legislature were almost successful in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. Also during that time some electors would occasionally vote for whomever they please and not vote for their party's candidate. If the electoral college were to ever go into a tie it would be given to the House of Representatives. During this time the the states representatives will be cating thier votes on behalf of thier state. The problem with that is that those representatives are voting on behalf of thier entire state and that means they are voting for who they want and acting like that it is something the entire state wants.

There are five ""offical"" benifits of having the electoral college. The benifits are certainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and you avoid run-off election. All of these things are in fact true but what if you are willing to risk all of that just to be able to be the one who has a say in who becomes president. I know that they kind of do but in reality that does not really mean much if there is someone who is going to completly disregard my vote and do whatever he feels like doing. I know that all of those five benifits are important but isnt my right to have a say in whose president important as well?

Senator, the reason for my letter is that I want to have a say in who the president is going to be and the electoral college resticts that. I believe that the president of the United States should be elected by popular vote because this is America and in America we do what the people want and the people want change. We want the electoral college out and popular vote in.

Sincerely,

A concerned citizen    ",5,5,0.8517155647277832
c7430fd,"When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states.

The Electoral College should continue being used in today's government as a form of selecting the president because it simplifies the outcome of the vote. When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some constroversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and  almost impossible to argue against. Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their canidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, ""in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the canidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extreamly unelikely.

Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states. It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College"" P.22. A run-off election extreamly complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.

The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a run-off election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their canidate however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their canidate because they are chosen by the canidates party or the canidate themself. The Electoral College gives political weight to states and is very useful in deciding the new president with no debates over who won.    ",6,5,0.8261457681655884
