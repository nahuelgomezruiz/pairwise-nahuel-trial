93dcffc,"Fellow citizens we should limit ower car usage and see the advantages that we can gain from it. Having a car can bring lots of tense and responsibility along with lots of money having to be spent. In (Source 1) it states that ""When i had a car I was alwayse tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Car ownership require lots of of money to be spent on the car ,on a garage and even a parcking space. In (Soure 1) it states that ""Germany car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space,for $40,000, along with a home"". An advantage from limiting your car usage would be to make the cities denser, and better for walking. In (Source 1) it states that ""While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs"".     ",2
2107217,"Saving The World, One Car At A Time

In country like Germany,Paris, and Colombia, they limit the use of cars due to carbon emission. I think that this is a great idea. Limiting car usage means less pollination, which would benefit us greatly.

""If this patterns persists"" says Elisabeth Rosenthal, we could turn this problem around. Take Paris for instance, they issued a ban against driving on specific days. Though ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Robert Duffer's article, the""congestion was down 60 percent. You can't tell me that is not remarkable.

We could just take a day and walk or ride our bicycle to work/school, and  make a difference, so let's try. I know some people think that driving less is an inconvience and won't stop carbon emission, but I think the opposite is true. There will be ""gray clouds"" like Andrew Selsky says, but we CAN save the world, even if it just one car at a time.    ",2
14c579b,"Should we give up our cars in order to live a better life?

That's the question on everyones mind right now , but it's a no brainer! Places all over the world have done this as an experiment and it seems as if they like the results. Here are a few key points from passages that will help persuade you into joining the idea of getting rid of cars.

Vauban, Germany has given up their cars for a better and healther life. So many families in Vauban have given up their cars that 70 percent of them don't even own a car! The reason why Vauban did this is because they realized that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and more than triple that amount in car-intensive areas in the United States. Looking on the bright side of this since there is less space for parking stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. If you want to drive a car you can always buy a small area for $40,000 that also comes with a house where you can park the car which would have to be a hybrid.

Paris did the same thing that Vauban did but in a different way. On Monday mototrist with even- numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Of course there were people who didn't obey the new law and where fined and some even had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine; however, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The only exceptions were plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers since they didn't really affect the pollution as much as cars that use up a lot more gas. Doing this cleared the smog for some time in Paris, in fact, so much of the smog cleared that the French party was actually able to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.

Instead of making a law

BOGOTA, Colombia , created a program called car-free day where millions of Colobians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work or to do whatever they had to do. The goal of this program was obvious, to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog (Violators faced $25 fines). For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event of having no cars except for taxis and busses. By Bogota doing this the parks and sports centers have seen and highly approved of this idea and have turned uneven, pitted sidewalks into broad, smooth sidewalks. Along with the new improvements, new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have appeared.

In conclusion, getting rid of cars permitly or even just for a day or a week seems like a good idea. Lots of the people mentioned above highly approve of this and say that it actually makes them a lot happier and stress free. Of course the people who don't approve of this idea are the ones who were fined for driving on a no drive zone. All in all i still recommend this idea if things in Florida start to get out of hand and we must resort to something.    ",3
89034e7,"Why should we stop using cars especially to our everyday advantage? Cars can pollute the air running on normal gas rather then hybrid cars though. Why is being car-free such a big hit? Will the use of cars come to an end? Not driving cars can be good for us in many ways.

""Congestion was down 60% in France after 5 days the smog rivaled in Beijing, China, wich is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" (as Robert Duffer says in pragraph). The pollution can spread and make it worse some where else but be pollution free there. In france diesel feul is to blame for their pollution 67% compared to 53.3% of gasoline. Not using cars for only just a small amount of time can get rid of much of the pollution. Some people say its more stress free to not have cars around.

Being car-free is becoming more known and more people are trying it. There has been less traffic jams too. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" (as Andrew Selsky states in pragraph 21). Also that of having no stress and nonpolluted air. In Bogota, Columbia cars have been banned for 3 years. People are being more active and walking more, this is helping a lot because everyone is getting more excercise and being healthier and having no pollution is a plus because you can also breathe easier.

""Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (as Elisabeth Rosenthal states in paragrah 29.) The United States is very cultural based on cars. The use has dropped drastically because in 2013 the miles driven was 9% below the peak. A part of it was because some people dont make much money or have jobs. sociologists believe that being car-free can be a benefit to society but bad for car companies. More people are using technology to communicate rather then driving somewhere too see them in person.

Being care-free is a great way too live your life, theres so many advantages to not having to use your cars. This helps save money from gas or car problems. It helps you be healthier and more active. All in all it even helps pollution one of the biggest problems we have and a main cause is the gas from cars.            ",3
665b527,"Many citizens in the United States rely on cars as a way of transportation. What they don't realize is that there are multiple options to consider instead of a car. ""Why consider a new method of transportation?,"" you may ask. If we limited the car usage we would have great amouts of adavantages as a result.

One important result that would come if we limited car usage is having nearby store locations near by. "" In this new approach stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in a malls along some distant highway.""(Source one: In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars; paragraph six) Limiting car usage will result in new buildings, stores, houses to become at a fair enough distance to walk.

If we had stores nearby enough to walk, there's no need of a car. If car usages reduces, the amount of walking, or riding a bike would increase. This will lead to a better life style. Recent studies has showed that walking daily can improve a persons mind. ""When I had car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way.""( Source one: In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars; paragraph three.)

Another major positive affect that will result in reducing car usage is improving our atmosphere. One disadvantage cars cause, is air pollution. One example would be smog. The smog that we breath in is not good for our health.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""(Source three;paragrpah twenty-four). Not only if we reduce car usage we would gain positives outcomes but  we would reduce  pollution.

""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emmisons in Europe...and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Source one; paragraph five.)  We would be doing positive thing for ourself but a positive thing for the enviroment.

Our generation does not need to rely on a piece of mechanic to take them to their destination. We have the ability to get to our route, and have other options that are helpful for us and for our enviroment. We have multiple advantages if we would consider to reduce car usage. So the question would be, why dont we stop using cars, and start helping ourself and our enviroment knowing the  advantages we could be recieving in return.                                                        ",4
