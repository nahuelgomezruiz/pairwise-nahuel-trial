5a40c03,"Have you ever thought about the future? As a day gose by we have to start think about what will today be in 10 years from now. i can picture my self getting into a car that has automatic opeing doors and the car driving it self. We are living in a society where new thing are being made every day, just like the new cool hoverbored.

There are many pros to the new invention people are coming out with. Several of the ones i have herd are about how they will make life a lot easier. For example look at the new hover bored, a flat surface that can move right left back forward yes this make life easier but it also effects us. You could be walking places that will give you good extercise.

When you take a look at car driving themselfs that is kinda scary though. just imagen what could happen if the car took a wrong turn and there was a big trailer coming that could be your last day alive. We see on televison and movies that have long been fascinted with cas that could drive themselves but that is all but in reality that is all fanticy made by a computer. this world has taken it a step to far on how we are just being here for nothing why dont we just have computer do everything. Because that is what it looks like.

In conclusion I feel that this is a very hard topic to arrgue about beuase yes I would like to make life easier but at the same time I want it to be safe. I feel like we should be take life nice and slow and more car driving on there own for a bit firther in the future.   ",2,3,0.5382265448570251,1499
c94b689,"Would you trust technology to keep you safe? If yes, would you put your family including yourself in a car being driven by technology? Many scientists and engineers are working vigoursly to bring this driverless car dream to reality, which could mean that those very same imaginary cars that drive themselves in the disney movie ""Cars"" could be on the streets pretty soon. Although, I do enjoy new technology ""driverless cars "" is a technology in which I don't want to see developed or used. These cars cause more harm than good and so far have not been perfected at all as there is not one, not one fully driverless car, meaning that all of the driverless cars need a human to assist it. Many of these new cars are not ready and really wont be much of an assistance when ready, as they have quite a few more problems with them.

For example, the closest fully driverless car is a Telsa that willl be released sometime in 2016 that can drive by itself 90 percent of the time. Also these cars are not neccessarily the safest either as multiple states have made laws banning the use of these type of cars. The states have stated that they are not completely safe drivers( the autopilet driver) and that it is just not safe to allow cars to drive themselves. Another big controversy that these cars have started the debate on whether the human driver or manufacturer should be faulted with an accident. These are just some of the reasons people should stick to driving themselves around.

So, now do you trust technology to keep you safe? How do you feel about a car driving you around? Well, driverless cars still have quite a bit of kinks to fix in their whole operation before they set out on the road. However, driving on your own and making sure you and family gets home safely wouldn't be such a bad idea to me either. Eventhough these new cars can vastly propel the world futher into future, they are not quite ready to hit the highway.",3,3,0.769435465335846,1940
9b7a85c,"When I think of driverless cars I think of cars driving down the road with no one in them, but I also think of how many problems could go wrong with these cars. People could get hurt in a car accident because of something the driverless cars do. I am against the driverless cars for these reasons; They are unsafe, unreliable, and so many things could go wrong with them. If the driver that is suppose to be in the driverless car falls asleep and the car alarm doesn't go off when in need of help it could crash and the individual in the driverless car could die from the crash. I feel the car is unreliable for that reasoning.

These cars are unsafe because if the car was to get out of control and the individual of the car couldn't control it because it was to hard to control it could hit a kid or a adult. So many things could go wrong with these driverless cars. It could be that the individuals that are suppose to take over did something wrong but if they didn't have to take over in the first place then there would be less accidents. In conclusion I feel like the driverless cars are going to be a waste of time and money because they are going to result in more deaths and traumas. More car accidents are going to be reported every year and the individuals of the driverless cars are going to be held responsible because it would be there fault when really it was the driverless car that got out of control. Google Cofounder ""Sergey Brin"" says ""Such cars would fundamentally chage the world."" I believe that the only way these cars are going to chage the world is cause more deaths and injuries in the world and it's going to be the faults of the cars and the individuals inside the driverless cars are going to get charged with the charges because they are suppose to be the ""drivers"" of these so called driverless cars . If they are so driverless the why do they have to have individuals take over whenever they are in need of help? I believe the way things are going now are just fine. You don't see humans calling for help when there is a wreck or roadwork so why should so called smarter driverless cars need the help of humans if they are suppose to be taking our places on the road?",3,3,0.8701205253601074,2200

Driverless cars throw people off because how could a car be driverless when the driver still has to be paying attention to the road? The driver has to be prepared at all times to be ready to take over the wheel. Drivers can not fully rely on driverless cars because drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, drivers are trusting a computer with their life, and the dangers of bordem behind the wheel.

Drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, even if the ""driverless"" car is driving. The driverless car can not drive through work zones or around accidents, so the driver has to take control. The driver has to stay alert and ready for anything to come their way. The Google car announces when the driver should be ready to take control, but shouldn't a driverless car be able to drive on it's own? Eventhough the car can drive itself, the driver is still in position like they're going to drive too.

Drivers are trusting a computer based opperator with their life. What if the car was to get in an accident? Whose fault would it be? Drivers can't fully trust a computer to drive their car because they computer could mess up, and could cause an accident. What if a kid were riding a bike, and were to suddenly fall into the street and the driverless car did not read it? That would cause a big uproar for driverless cars. They are not proven to be 100% safe for the world around us.

The dangers of bordem of not driving could be very serious as well. The driver has to pay attention to the road at all times, but they are not driving. This could cause serious bordem, and could lead to falling asleep behind the wheel. At least when driving is occoured the driver has something to do.

Now a driverless car is not a bad idea. The text says that driverless cars use half the fuel that cars use today, and that driverless cars have driven half a million miles without a crash. Driverless cars could be the future, but there would still need to be a lot of work done to the cars to make sure they are completely safe for drivers. Instally cameras in the car would also help with teenagers, and some adults to not be behind the wheel on their phone, which could lead to less accidents. So, driverless cars are a good thing that could come into society.

Driverless cars sound dangerous right now, but as technology advances, they could help in the future. As of right now, driverless cars not be fully relied on because drivers still have to pay attention to the road, computers can crash, and the dangers of falling asleep behind the wheel could be dangerous. Driverless cars are not ready to be on the roads yet.",4,3,0.8348073959350586,2683
acaec30,"New cars that drive on their own, sounds fun right? Well think again. Diverless cars should not be used thoughout the world. Diverless cars are not counted as driverless because people will still have to take control of them while in traffic zones, and during other occasions. Not everyone will be able to afford one of these driverless cars so people who usually ride in taxes or buses will no longer have that option. Also, cameras were thought of to be put in these cars to watch divers to make sure people are paying attention even though they are not driving to insure their safety if the driver has to take control, but that is invasion of privacy.

Why would you go out to buy a car that is ""driverless"" when you need to still have to drive it at any given time, and still have to watch the road? That defeats the whole purpose of having a car that drives on it's own. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" It says ""All are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills, such as navagating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"".

If driverless cars become the new car than many people who take the bus, and ride taxis will be unable to have rides to their locations anymore. Especially if all other types of cars are got rid of. A lot of low income families rely on a taxi, train, bus, or even a subway as a cheaper way to get around because they cannot afford a car. That means they would be walking while higher class people are riding in a driverless car. The argument for supporters of driverless cars was ""The cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Still it does not change the matter that people would still have to walk to get to where they need to go if they cannot afford a driverless car.

Some people believe that diverless cars will be a good thing because it is a peak of our technology, they also think that the driverless cars will be able to help people stay focused on the road just as the article says ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" But that statement is not exactly true. If a person is put in a car that drives on it's own they are going to get more distracted and choose to be on their phones rather than paying attention to their surroundings because a driverless car is made to, drive on it's own.

That is why driverless cars should not be made, or even thought to be created. In reality, they are a distraction, they do not fufill their purpose, and they would end up costing way more than they are worth. ",4,3,0.8280761241912842,2736
aa5918f,"Today, there are advance technology in the society such as computers, cars, cell phones, and etc but no one ever tried to develop an driverless cars. Today in our society, many people tried to develop new technologies because things are getting more advanced an effective. Driverless cars are one of their plan, where the cars has sensors and know what to do. I agree the development of driverless cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there is still alert in the car.

The driverless cars should be develop and introduced to the soiety because the cars uses less fuel than the cars we used today. The text states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" From this example we can tell that the cars is great because they used less fuel than the the cars we sued today. Thus, people do not have to worried about they will ran out the fuel when they're driving. Most of the people loved to use cars that used less fuels because they do not have to spend much money on the fuel. The text also states, ""Offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This example shows that the driverless cars have more rooms than a bus. People to sit in a place where there is not croweded because it's comfortable. Driverless cars solved the overcroweded the problem because it got more spaces. Thus, I agree the development of the cars.

While the driverless cars used less fuel, the cars can drive million miles without a crash. The text states, ""Their cars have driven more than half million miles without a crush."" This example tells us that the car is safer than the cars we drive today. If a car can drive million miles without any crashing then we considered it's an great car because most of the cars were not safe and it gets into car accident very often.

The most important is that there are still alert in the car. The text states, ""...Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of hallways."" This example shows that when there is something happened to the car, the cars will alert the driver that there is something going on but most of the cars do not have that kind of technique. Second, the text states, ""Dealing with comlicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This example shows that when there is an major accidents or traffic issues then the car will alert you to move out the car quickly before anything happened. In other hand, people disagree to develop the driverless cars. The text states, ""Why would anyone want a driverless cars that still needs a driver?"" They claimed that the driverless cars should do everything by itself instead having the dirver controlling it. They think there is no difference if we use a normal car. I disagree with them because it's safer if we have a real driver in the car, they'll prevent anything bad happened.

Driverless cars can have more advanced technique in the future when there are more people supporting it. Thus, we should not give up on developing the cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there are still alert in the car that helped people to know what happened.
