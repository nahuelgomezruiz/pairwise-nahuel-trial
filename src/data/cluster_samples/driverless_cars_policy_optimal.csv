3baeae9,"Driverless cars are quite a new invention. They can be both helpful and non helpful. Driverless cars are a scince break through. They put in a lot of hard work to get the car done and ready for the road. It will change the way we drive.

Driverlesss cars can only go about 25 miles per hour. They can only go that speed because that is a safe speed through neighborhoods and in school districts.

The driverless car has to have a human in the driver's seat at all times. It has to because if their is a wreck or road consturuction you can set the pace and stay safe. The car can not detect those that is why you have to take over.

Driverless cars are very safe to be in. They will get you from piont A to piont B in the safest way possible. As you see in paragrah 7 you have to be in the driver's seat and touching the wheel for it to work it is very good for people to use. It will really help with the elderly people for parking in hard conditions. The driverless car is a science break through and willchange the way we drive.",2
88de2df,"Driverless cars are very unecessary and will only cause trouble that can be avoided. These cars are unecessary, because driving is not one of the huge problems in the world. A lot of other issues should be viewed as more urgent to take care of, than the development of cars that do not need people behind the wheel and in control. They will only cause problems, because they can easily get into accidents, among many other issues. It was just spoken about this week in the news: Google's car got into its first accident.

In order to completely transfer over to driverless cars, a lot of things have to be changed and developed. Not only are the cars themselves problematic (they are not even able to react around an accident site), but there are no laws stating who is responsible if a vehicle with no driver causes an accident to happen. Who is held responsible in the end? A prediction some can make is that many lawsuits will be formed against both the maker of the vehicle, and the driver behind the wheel. The question will also arise that if neither were in control, can you blame something such as a car? Another problem that the cars could create, is a huge spending issue. In the article it is stated that a certain device ""cost two hundred million dollars."" That is a lot of money to spend on the system for one car. And the cars need many sensors in order for them to run smoothly, such as,"" a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors,"" and that might be roughly half of all one car needs. Another problem that could arise is the conditions of roads. Many of the driverless cars that the article states have been developed have needed specific conditions in order to function correctly, such as ""a special test track"" or ""magnets with alternating polarity."" How would those cars function in an everyday situation out on the open road? Not very well. So how would they be able to develop a vehicle that can operate on a true highway, as well as on the many other types of roadways in the world? An issue that should be brought up also, is that none of the developed vehicles have been completely driverless. They need humans to do certain things for them behind the wheel, such as navigating crash scenes. What happens if a driver who is bored while their car drives for them forgets to be paying attention?

In conclusion, driverless cars are not something that should be stood for. They will only create trouble that is not needed in the world, and can possibly lead to way bigger issues, such as in our economy. The development and actual distribution of these cars would be something unprecedented and who knows what could come of unprecedented things. In reading this article, it was easy to pick out things that could go wrong, and reasons it would not be in the world's best interest to go further in the development, but it was a lot harder to pick out what could go right and how these cars could help the world. If something might do more harm than good, why do it? ",3
d1bb139,"Driverless cars would be a helpful tool in the future. They could help us get things done while heading somewhere far away. It could get rid of driver errors. Drunk driving could even by stop by this new product. This is why the driverless car should be allowd.

First off the time you use to drive all the way down to Florida is about 12-18 hours. Lets say someone is going there for their job that 12-18 hours could be used for all sorts of things like making up for you job while your away or just finshing a project you did for this meet. It would be a great way to use your time instead of having to drive. This could be an amazing break through for somepeople who have to travel many times for their job.

Secondly, if we have only driverless cars all driving they would know how to react to each other. This inturn would get rid of driver error such as drivers getting angry at each other. Another example would be cars speeding past each other, which cause recks. Driverless cars could bring down the death toll from car crashs every year by getting rid of driver error.

Finally, a big problem today is drunk driving. If we had driverless cars the drunk drivers would never have to touch the wheel making the roads safer. The car its self could never get drug or slow down its reaction speed making it safer than with someone above .08. This could also bring down the death toll, for drunk driving crashs every year.

These are all reasons i believe that we could be better of with driverless cars. It may cost more and their might be problems at first but in the long run it could save many of lives. Many states do not trust it, but i believe after they make they cars smarter they will see that they can driver better than any human ever could. Saving lives for many people which if worth it.   ",3
4cbcf7f,"What has the world come to? Technology is improving each and every day. People are comming up with new inventions such as: iwatches, wireless headphones, and many more amazing gadgets. It crazy how much the world relies on technology now and days. For the most, part people use technology everywheer they go. In the artical, ""Driverless Cars Are Comming"" , it states pros amd cons of having this invention. I believe that driverless cars can be dangerous! It can also lead to more car accidents. With the driverless cars humans would have no control over the car. This comes to show that the developement of these cars would not be safe for the people across the world.

The idea of driverless cars would not be safe because people would not pay attention to the roads as much. As stated in the article, ""This means the human river must remain alert and be ready to take over when this situation occurs."" This specific quote shows that driverless cars can be extremely dangerous. People in the drivers seat would have to be alert at all times. Sometimes, people are doing other things in the drivers seat such as: falling asleep, on the phone, or just completely not paying attention to the road. These things that were just listed are some of the main reason why there are so many car accidents that occur on the side of the road.

In reality, there are certain laws that apply when people are driving. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best avhieved with alert drivers."" This quote comes to further prove my point that the idea of driverless cars would not be a good thing. The passage also says, ""in most states is is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" It is illegal for inventions like driverless cars to be tested. So ... What's the point ? ""Why would anyone want a driveerless car that still needs a driver?""

This evidence comes to show that driverless car are not neccessary in the world and would just cause more problems.

In conclusion, the negative aspects presented in this passage further prove that driverless cars are not safe and are useless if a person is still need in the car just in case. ",3
4b79d77,"Though the idea of driverless cars is not a new one, it is a now becoming a possibility. The cars we watched in movies and shows, will no longer need a screen to exist, in the near future. Driverless cars are not only now becoming a reality but may help decrease the amount of reckless driving that takes place on the road.

The advanced technology, used in these cars, can detect possible dangerous situations. These cars, can use its ability to control the power of the engine and to apply brakes to specific wheels, something the driver does not have the ability to do.

Those against driverless cars may argue, that the driver may become bored and would become less alert once on the road. However, Some manufactures plan to add in car entertainment and information systems that gives the driver a heads up in times they may need to take over. In order for that driver to notice those notifications, they must be alert. Which means, cell phones have no choice but to be put to the side. Possibily making texting and driving a thing of the past.

Another concern posed, is how these cars would work, legally. In states such as, California, Nevada, and Florida, use of semi-automatic cars is limited and in states where it isn't who would be to blame in the event of an accident? The driver or the manufactuer? Laws will surely be put in to address these issues and similar issues have already occured. If a person's brakes fail to work, it usually isn't the driver's fault. So if the issue was programming, the manufacturer would be held liable. Also, those producing the cars are currently working to rarify the occurance of the technology failing on the driver.

The existence of driverless cars is expected to happen soon, with Tesla stating a 2016 realese and other manufactures predicting their releases in the year 2020.

Driverless cars, may even drive us towards a future with less accidents, and more technological advances. We'll have to wait and see in which direction this will take us.    ",4
5ac9060,"I am completely against driverless cars. There are three main reasons I am completely against driverless cars: there is already a problem in our country with obesity, humans don't even have the process of regular automobiles down yet, and most importantly these cars still require human assistance.

I do not think a driverless car is a good idea, one main issue with the U.S population is its obesity and unhealthy way of living. The only thing this driverless car is doing, is taking another activity away from us and doing it for us. This driverless car will most likely draw in about more then half of the U.S pedestrians and bike riders, not directly taking away the physical activity but giving citizens another easier option.

Personally I believe this driverless car is a dangerous idea, and we are biting off more then we can chew. Our automotive industry is a very well designed system, but it is nowhere near perfect. We still have cars that malfunction, need a ton of assistance, and more technology is just gonna make it worse. The cars themselves are not the biggest problem at all, it is some of the current drivers in the U.S. Some people dont even know how to change oil, jumpstart a battery, or other little things that an automobile could possibly need. So, until our automotive industry is completely perfect and our drivers are completely safe in what we have now. I personally wouldnt want anything that a normal citizen would understand even less on the roads.

The biggest reason I believe the driverless car is a bad iea, is the fact that a person is more likely to fall asleep. Now, the companies say they are coming up with ways to alert driver such has a vibrating seat, or flashing lights. That is completely ridiculous if you ask me, there is no telling how a person would react upon waking up to vibration or flashing lights. Every person wakes up different, sometimes it is frantic, drowsy, or maybe even scared. There is just no scientific way to be comfortable with a persons reactiopn upon waking up.

I am totally against the driverless car. There are many many liabilities and safety issues. Not to mention mental and physical health deffecencies. ",4
