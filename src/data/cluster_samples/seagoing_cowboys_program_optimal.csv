The UNRRA created the Seagoing Cowboys program to help recover the damages of World War II, which you can be one of the people to help!

If you think we barely go places, then you're wrong. I have sailed and ocean 18 times while being a Seagoing Cowboy! You might think it takes a massive time out of your life, but it really doesn't. To cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States took me only two weeks! Also, it only took a month to get to China! If you think it is boring, you are wrong once again. When we are sailing across the ocean, we play multiple games, such as baseball and volleyball!

This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I got to help others that have been effected by World War II. I also got to sail around and see other countries you have wanted to see. I got to sail around the world playing volleyball and baseball while I waited! I only had one or two duties to do, besides that it is all fun! Before I had a boring life, but when I joined it was full of adventures!",2
df2b290,Well in the Seagoing Cowboys program i think people and plus they get to travel on a boat. Reason why i would join it is because when they get to travel around and they can see things like animals and so that i can play with the animals. If u were a small time boy just like Luke Bomberger you could have a unbelievable trip. The trips were amazing also but the one that standed out to me was the cattle-boat trips. It took two whole week to cross the Atlantic Sea. Luke Bomberger had a job as a watchmen once and it didnt go to well he. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour he was going to cheack on theam when he flew and he broke his ribs. But most importantly of all it opened up the world to Luke Bomberger he said he is grateful for this opportunity. It made him be more aware of people. He hosted a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many of years to tell him about his job.,2
c29eca8,"I believe everyone should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of how much help you can bring other people. For example, it was right when World War II ended that the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to recover animals for the countries that were left in ruins. I did this job of recovering cattle even when it was hard. I was helping not only for Seagoing Cowboys it was also my military service.

Another reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys is it opens up the world. When you are delivering animals to other countries there are so many things to see. You get to see marvelous places. For example when I was taking cattle to Greece I got to see most of Europe and China.

There are so many beneificial reasons for becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. You are helping others in need and having fun at the same time;once you have fullfilled your duties, that pleasure of helping out will stay with you forever. For example, in the current day my family and I have exchange students. I loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and I hope this inspires you to become a Seagoing Cowboy too.    ",3

2e9bd97,"Come one, come all! Come join the Seagoing Cowboys program. After war, many citys and towns are left in ruins. Who will help the poor people who lost everything? I am glad you ask! You can help assist with helping animals cross safly to a new home. Come help out! The animals need your help to travle safly to and from the sea. It will all be worth it to see the smiles on the peoples faces! We could really use your help. The following shows all the important and awsome things you need to know about it.

One of the amazing pros of joining is you can help others. As Luke says,""It was an opportunity of a life time."" Helping people get back all the food supplies, animals, and more leaves a good feeling. It could make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs, like Luke.

The only complain that you might have is a few ingerys. Like when Luke cracked his ribs on one rainy night. You may get knocked over bord but that is very unlikly. All those times you helped people will surely make up for that. It could really be fun if you just try it. If you did not like your fist trip, you could always quit. At least you helped a few people out.

A few more exiting things woulg be the chance to sight see on your free time. Luke said,""Besides helping people, their is a benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, son was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy."" You may get the pleasure of seeing one, or both of those. Would that be awsome or what?

You can also have fun on the trip back. Like how Luke got to baseball and volleyball games after the animals got droped off. Table-tennis tornaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time of being at see. That way you are not bored out of your mind on the way back.

It can also be hard work to. You have to feed and water the animals two or three times a day. Sometimes you might have to take night watchman. That is were you have to get up every hour to check out the animals and report back to the captain. Just be careful or you might get hurt, like Luke did. Helping out with the animals can be fun, too. Even if it is exstrimly hard work.

Even if it is hard work you can still have fun. Sight seeing and the trip home is amazing. So come on! Join the Seagoing Cowboys program! It can be dangderous and hard, but in the end there are more great things to do than all the small dangers. Hard work is the price to pay if you do want to join. All the sights to see, helping people in tmes of needs, and the awsome trips will be fun!

So come join today! I am certain you will not regret it! Come help the cause. It will be an amazing experiance!",4
