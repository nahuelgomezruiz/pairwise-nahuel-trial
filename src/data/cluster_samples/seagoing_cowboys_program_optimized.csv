Well if you think that the Seagoing Cowboys is bad well, let me tell you about it! See the Seagoing Cowboys program is that 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA.UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke Don signed up!

In Augest 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. It took about two weeks for them to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to gt to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for just a small-town boy. In the Seagoing Cowboys, you can go on avdentures and visit many unique places. I know in your opinion that its a lot of work but you need work to get things and go to places that you want to go. So thats all i have to say.

Luke did this when he was with the Seagoing Cowboys program. He traveled to Europe and China. Luke saw the Acropolis in Greece. Luke was also able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Another one of Luke's reason you shouls join the Seagoing Cowboys program is helping the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program was hired by the UNRRA to take good care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas to other countries. Luke was able to feed the horses with hay and oats. Luke had to water and feed the animals two to three times a day. He also had to clean the animals stall. Luke had to haul bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ships. Luke also had the job of checking up on the animals at night every hour.

Another one of Luke's reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is how much fun you can have. On the return trips when the animals have been unloaded. Luke and his fellow cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where the animals had been housed. Luke and his cowboy friends played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading and other games also helped the cowboys to have fun and pass the time.

Those were three of Luke's reason of why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys programs. Lets review what those three reasons are the first one is being able to see the world, the second one is being able to help and care for the animals, and the last reason is being able to have fun.",3,6,0.8819096088409424,1654

There are many reasons to join the UNRRA. You get to help other people by giving them what they need to survive. You can by giving them food, clothing, and shelter. When you help other people with their needs, you get to go to other countries that you might have only heard about or not even heard of at all. When you bring people what the need to survive, you can see the joy on their faces. Seeing joy in others is a warm and inviting feeling. You can go sightseeing and go visiting very, very important places. I have been to many important places and landmarks, and so can you if you join. If you have dreamed about crossing oceans and helping others, then this is a job for you.

When the feeling of boredom strikes you if you have been on the boat for a long time, you have the chance to get to know your shipmates better and make friends. There also may be games to play on board like baseball and volleyball in empty stalls where the animals once were. There is table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling; which is carving things into blocks of wood and various other games. If you love taking care of animals, then you might be good at this job. There are many other jobs on board the ship. There is the opportunity to learn about your shipmates, learn what other countries and other people need, and there is also the opportunity to mature.

All of these things I have learned or done while on this job and trip around the world helping others. This is your chance to join the UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) or become a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" today. We need you now! ",3,6,0.6692525744438171,1699
