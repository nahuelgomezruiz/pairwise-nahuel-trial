d6d1058,"On the day of March 2, 2006 a NASA worker Sally Herring was called to be on the news show "" All about that news"", she was asked to speak with news worker Ted Cruze about the sightings/picutres from Mars of the misterious ""face"".

As Sally was aproaching the stage of the news studio there was bunches of people in the audience waiting to hear the truth, but Sally was sure most of these people weren't going to hear what they want to hear because a lot of people are wrong with their opinions to this subject.

As the show begun the news reporter Ted Cruze asked the question everyone was waiting for, ""Are those pictures from Mars signs that aliens were there and left those misterious faces?"" Everyone was in gradual shock ready to hear the truth.

As Sally started to speak she started off talking about how people may think that aliens were the reasons we found these sightings on Mars. For years that is just what people believe, they think aliens were the reason for those faces but from what NASA has to say about it, all these people are wrong.

Most people don't even believe in aliens but if half of their state or city is saying that of course those people will go with the flow. But with the scientific reaserch NASA has done majority of these people are wrong! As the show continued on the crowd was going wild and Ted was shocked himself at was Sally was announcing out about the rare face. People were screaming and being argumentive because so far they are all just completly wrong on what they have been believing. As the show was winding down to the very end there was a quesion from the audience asking Sally how she even knew all this stuff and if it was even true. Sally's response was that everything she knows has been discovered by her and the other workers at NASA, they have all been very curious of what is going on as well as everyone else and so they have been trying their best to do their job and get the truth! Sally finished the news show making sure everyone knew the truth and to make sure she arugued her case. She also made sure that eveyone new that this misterious face was not left from aliens that it was infact just a natural landform we have captured on camera and that her information was very well certified because of course she works with NASA and they all know what their doing!",2
ebf9d50,"NASA's scientists are adiment that ""the face on the mars"" is actually a face. First of all, why would there be a face ON THE GROUND. Do they really think that some nonexisting extra-terrestrial decided that he wanted to put his face on the ground and leave a mark that he was there? Probably not. Also, none of these ""faces"" actually look like a face. It looks like a rock fell or something.

Nothing about these pictures are authentic. If you look closely, it clearly is not a face. I'm not going to go into details and try to figure out what it is myself, but that is definitely not a face. This ""face"" is a natural landform . There are plenty of places on Earth that looks like faces, but are just patches or grass, or dirt.

How can NASA try and conclude that some life form decided to put their face print in the dirt? They really can't.

In conclusion, The face is not a face, for it is a natural landform. A rock must have fell on the mesa. But it will never be a face. Never has, and never will. Nobody has actually been on Mars to even back up this evidence, so what proof do they really have??",2
f70824b,"The face on Mars wasn't created by aliens. The way I know this is that our spacecraft around the planet Mars took pictures and concluded that it was just a martian Mesa or just a natural landform. We unveiled the picture to the public to see what they see it has a illusion of nose,mouth, and some eyes. We had non believers at NASA like myself,so we had sent another spacecraft to see if the face was really was created by aliens or if it was a natural land form. On April 5, 1998, We sent a Mars Global surveyour to the planet and snapped ten pictures sharper than those on the original Viking camera. Revealing that the face was just a natural landform. People were not satisfied and said it was a haze so on April 8th, 2001, A cloudless summer day in Cydonia we drew close enough to the landform for a second look. We captured an extraordinary picture using the maximum resolution. We got a Martian equivelant of a mesa or a butte. Landforms commonly seen in the American west. I said,""It reminds me most of the butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""",2
3ab4c11,"The face is not created by aliens and here are a few reasons why. It was a mesa, or maybe even a shadow. but aliens is not a logical reason for this face to exisist on mars.

First, A mesa, a mesa is a very common landform found around the American West. Even so there is one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, USA. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. If something on the earth can have a mesa about or the same height had the face on mars it is very likely that it was a mesa.

Secondly, shadows We all knows that shadows can be very deceiving just like in this instance. A shadow could have been reflecting off the viking 1 while it was taking this photo of the ""Face"", or maybe the shadows were from a bigger land form. that was infront, behind, or on the sides casting a shadow onto this mesa.

All in all, From these facts you can conclude that this was a natural landform and not some type of alien thing. If you still do not believe that it was natural. Another spaceship went into space and found the ""Face"" and took a very detailed picture and there were no markings or signs of aliens.               ",3
0ba78ec,"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.

Out of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a ""human"" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.

To conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.        ",3
637ba77,"Recently, there has been an issue about a the so-called ""Face"" landform on Mars. People across the world are arguing that the Face was created by aliens. Scientists at NASA are arguing otherwise. I believe the Face was not created by aliens.

First of all, the scientists at NASA want the Face to be made by an alien civilization. The Face being made by an alien civilization would boost NASA's popularity, therefore boosting NASA's budget. With a higher budget, NASA would be able to explore more, possibly even explore the Face. If there was an alien civilization, NASA would have no reason to hide it. NASA would reveal it to the public and most likely do more research. Finding information about another civilization would be a good thing for NASA.

Next, pictures have been taken of the landform. On April 5, 1998, pictures were taken by Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team. The pictures showed a natural landform, not an alien-made monument, which is exactly what NASA scientists expected.

Most importantly, there are natural landforms just like the Face on Earth. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Jim Garvin, who is a cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Quotes from this professional scientist show that a landform exactly like the Face could appear on Earth.

Although some people might say that the picture wasn't clear, scientists have cleared that up. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor was close enough to take another picture. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,"" says Garvin. The pixels in the picture from that day span 1.56 meters each, compared to 43 meters per pixil in the best 1976 Viking photo. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

These reasons show that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens and is just a regular landform. The Face is just as likely to occur on Earth as it is on Mars. It is just a butte or mesa with unusual shadows that make it look like a face. I believe the Face was not created by aliens.   ",4
