You may never have this kind of oppurtunity again, so why not take it. All you have to do is feed some cattle a couple times a day, clean some stalls, and if your the night watchman, all you do is check on the cattle once every hour then report back to the captain.

After you drop off the cattle or shipment at its desired location you can go look around and do some sight seeing. No matter where you are i bet you can see some amazing things, even if your not much of a sightseer i bet you'll end up seeing something that you've never seen before.

Then on your way back home on the ship, you and your crew mates can play games and sports where the cattle or shipment used to be to pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy may not seem very fun, but it can be if you make the most out of it.",2,6,0.7411688566207886

Well if you think that the Seagoing Cowboys is bad well, let me tell you about it! See the Seagoing Cowboys program is that 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA.UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke Don signed up!

In Augest 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. It took about two weeks for them to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to gt to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for just a small-town boy. In the Seagoing Cowboys, you can go on avdentures and visit many unique places. I know in your opinion that its a lot of work but you need work to get things and go to places that you want to go. So thats all i have to say.

4e14b2f,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun! My friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe in a cattle boat. It sounded fun, the chance to travel around the world and go see places I've dreamed about. I mean how could you pass up an offer like that? So, of couse I said yes. It was 1945, World War II had just ended in Europe, and countries needed help recovering from the war. To help these countries recover more than 44 countries joined together to make the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or the UNRRA. This program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" (that's what I was) to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules while the animals were on the ship. Don and I signed up of couse it sounded fun, and I had helped my Aunt Katie on her farm when I was a boy so I has some exspirence. Finally we received our orders to report to New Orleans, I couldn't wait to go out and help people. We had arrived on August 14, that's the day the Pacific war had ended. When we got our seaman's papers we boarded to SS Charles W. Wooster, we were heading to Greece, I was so excited. In cargo we had 335 horses plus enough oats and hay to feed of the horses.

I had turned 18 before I had arrivede at Gresse, so that meant I could be drafted for military service, but when my draft board had leanred I was on a cattle-boat trip be just told me to keep doing what I was doing. In the service you help people and help to fight for your country and if he told me to keep doing what I was doing that means I'm doing something that is going to help people in a big way. The cargo is going to help feed people in need because of the war destroying their food supplies. Not only did I help people, I also got to see Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Also taking a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy was amazing too! The city with streets of water was beautiful. I also go to tour an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

On theses trips I got to meet new people and see new places. I got to help people in need, and that felt good. It feels good when you see someone that's suffering because their home was destroyed and when you help them they have a smile on their face. Taking care of the cattle, horses, and mules was fun. We also found the time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after all the animals had been unloaded. Us cowboys played baseball and volleyball in the empty hold where the animals were housed. We had table-tennis tournaments, boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and games aslo helped us pass the time.

There are so many opertunities when you're a Seagoing Cowboy. ""It opened up the world to me."" ""It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""

It would benifit them, they would be able to explore the world & i honestly think that would be great for them to experience the world. Another one is being able to help the animals with trouble that have been injured or left on the streets.

A good thing is you get to spend time with animals all day long! I think that would be fun. What i think is more fun is spending your time in the ocean, imagine being in a boat & all of the sudden you hear dolphins! How great would be?

Its not all just about helping animals once there all prepared & token care of you get to play with the cowboys! Baseball anything you desire they'll play.

Don Reist invited him to Europe on a cattle ship. Of course Luke could not say no to this offer when he knew it was an opportunnity of a life time.

When Luke arrived to New Orleans the day right after the Pacific war ended Stating in paragraph three. Luke already knew that this was a extordinary opportunity comeing forom him since he is just young man from a small town listed inparagraph 5. Luke knew from all the hard work he has done he was already nearly prepared for the work he would be doing on seas stated in paragraph 3,also he would be doing plenty of work from when animal needed to be feed at least 2-3 times a day plus thier stalls had to be cleaned. According to paragraph 8,

Luke would also have time with other people when the animals were boarded off they would play in thier stalls with volley balls or table tennis, boxing,fencing,reading and other game that passed time by.

Fianlly Luke knew bieng a Seagoing Cowboy would be a really great adventure. Being what he was helpin animals after war would surely open the world up to Luke himself. luke knew he was very greatful for the opportunity he had when it could been given to someone else. Luke stated in the article paragraph 9 ,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs"", when they all needed help with thier lives Luke would come with supply and carry on to the one with the same problems unlike Luke , Luke had a nice life in his small town thats why he shared some with the world and helped many countries Luke gave his time and hard work to many's of hundred, one thing Luke surely did is that, Luke gave.",2,6,0.6959794759750366

Yes,you'd be helping people and their ruined countries,but you'd be on an adventure! Luke went to Europe,Greece,China,and other exotic places. He toured castles and took fun rides on rivers or canals. He got to interact with animals to and from the places he went to. He also ofcourse got to interact with the people of these far away lands.

Now it's not just a bunch of fun and games. You have to do a lot of work. You would have many farm animals to take care of. Horses,cows,pigs,and goats. They need to be groomed,fed,watered,and watched over. Sometimes you'd have to stay up all night to watch over the animals.

I'm not saying you won't have any time to yourself on the boat. when you go to pick up the animals you can read,play baseball,or tennis in a lower deck or you could take long cat naps.

7c131fd,"Hi, I'm Luke Bomberger. I was a Seagoing Cowboy. You might be pondering what that is, and if you are, I will inform you. Seagoing Cowboys help animals, mostly horses, donkeys, cows, and mules, that are being shipped overseas to avoid harm get to their destination. Are you thinking that you maight like being part of this program? Here are some other good things about being a Seagoing Cowboy.

As I said before, you can help animals that are in danger and get to know them. This gives you a good feeling of helpfulness and compassion. I love to save lives, especially if they're animals'. I also liked to be freinds with them. Even though there are many other people on the boat with you, the creatures all have their own personalities, and this makes them fun to hang out with.

Another good thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you get to see the world. I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and an excavated castle in Crete. I have been to Europe, China, and Italy. You can go to all of these places, see these sights, and more if you join their program.

Fianlly, there are so many people on the boat with you that it is impossible not to make a friend and have fun almost every day. I have made ample new companions. There are also many games played on the ship. They include baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, reading, boxing, and whittling. As you can probably tell, these are all exciting to do with your buddies.

Now you can see why theis program is so important and fun. Although there are a few risks, such as stormy weather, it is worth it to see the animals get safely to their destination. You can join knowing that you will be making big differences in millions of creatures' lives. If you want to have an amazing time with friends, play enjoyable games, see awesome landmarks and buildings, and help and make friends with animals, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.",3,6,0.8709491491317749

Luke did this when he was with the Seagoing Cowboys program. He traveled to Europe and China. Luke saw the Acropolis in Greece. Luke was also able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Another one of Luke's reason you shouls join the Seagoing Cowboys program is helping the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program was hired by the UNRRA to take good care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas to other countries. Luke was able to feed the horses with hay and oats. Luke had to water and feed the animals two to three times a day. He also had to clean the animals stall. Luke had to haul bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ships. Luke also had the job of checking up on the animals at night every hour.

Another one of Luke's reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is how much fun you can have. On the return trips when the animals have been unloaded. Luke and his fellow cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where the animals had been housed. Luke and his cowboy friends played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading and other games also helped the cowboys to have fun and pass the time.

Those were three of Luke's reason of why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys programs.

When you help other people with their needs, you get to go to other countries that you might have only heard about or not even heard of at all. When you bring people what the need to survive, you can see the joy on their faces. Seeing joy in others is a warm and inviting feeling. You can go sightseeing and go visiting very, very important places. I have been to many important places and landmarks, and so can you if you join. If you have dreamed about crossing oceans and helping others, then this is a job for you.

When the feeling of boredom strikes you if you have been on the boat for a long time, you have the chance to get to know your shipmates better and make friends. There also may be games to play on board like baseball and volleyball in empty stalls where the animals once were. There is table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling; which is carving things into blocks of wood and various other games. If you love taking care of animals, then you might be good at this job. There are many other jobs on board the ship. There is the opportunity to learn about your shipmates, learn what other countries and other people need, and there is also the opportunity to mature.

Another reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that you get to see and experience lots of the world. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, on my nine trips, I got to see many parts of Europe and China.

When you join the Seaging Cowboys, you will get to see much of the world like I did.

So, Seagoing Cowboys, which are a part of the UNRRA, travel back and forth on a boat that carries a cargo of about 300 horses and enough food to feed them. This is a tough job for just a few guys becasue the animals need food, water, and their stalls had to be cleaned.

If you were a Seagoing Cowboy you would have alot of amazing opportunitys. In the story Luke states in paragraph five "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing China and Europe. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

You would also get to help people. You would get to take things that families need to them. Lastly, you could also have fun! On the way back when you don't have any cargo, you play or do fun activites. You could play baseball or volleyball where all of the animals where at on the way to your destination. Also you could box, fence, read, and have table-tennis tournaments.

Some people say they would not want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because of the long trip, but if you were doing fun activites such as reading, boxing, fencing, playing baseball, and taking care of the animals time would pass by. You also have the opportunity to see many new things. You could see China and Greece and lots of other countries. They also don't want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because they think you don't do much, but you get to take care of the animals and play games.

Second of all do you see how much help and care your giving . In the passage Luke cared for animals during the crossing , he fed them , and cleaned after them .

Him watching over the animals effected people by them not having to worry about the animals . Luke also made hourly reports to the captain , while he was doing this he was also having fun . So Luke helped alot while having fun , why not join today .
