3e1faa5,"Not one human has ever seen a living species in Mars or in any planet. In 1976 an odd feature appeared on Mars. Many people think that it looks like a human face. These people believe that the odd feature could be an alien living on Mars.

The news has been spreading around that the ""face on Mars"" is a creature living in space. I don't believe that aliens are real. Aliens are a figure that someone made up a long time ago hoping that their were more people in the Universe. I know this because if there were aliens in the Universe, someone probably would have already found one.

A lot of odd objects float around in space. The face that people are seeing could just be a meteor. Meteors float around the Universe just trying to make problems. The meteor could have blasted into Mars and created the face like feature. Things like this are not very rare. Meteors have rocketed into Earth a great number of times.

I also believe in Jesus. I believe in every single detail the Bible says. The face could be Jesus showing people that he is watching us. Everything in the Bible has either already happend or will happen in the future. Aliens are not in the Bible, therefore, I don't believe they exist.

If aliens really do exist we would have already found one. Humans have thought aliens are real for hundreds of years. The object could be a natural object like a meteor. Meteors pass through the Universe every single day. What makes this object different? Nothing make the object different. Jesus Christ has all of the creatures we need to know about in the Bible. Aliens are just not one of them.                  ",1,1,0.7084730863571167,1619
54a4e88,"Untill now we have never had a very clear picture of what is exactly that thing is. With the new high-resolution images the give us a better idea of what we are looking at. What this face on Mars is acually ia A mesa.

This human like face is nearly to miles in length and seems to be staring back at the camera. NASA was using the face on Mars to attract attention to Mars. While some say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life that NASA would rather hide. Defenders of NASA say that they wish there was an ancient civilzation. If there happened to be an acient civilzation on Mars just think about all to stuff that scientist could learn from Mars that could help describe all of the other planets.

The picture captured by Global Surveyor was ten times sharper than any of the other pictures ever taken. As the world saw this picture for the first time revealing a natural landform and that there was not alien monument after all. Some still belive that the face on Mars is an acient alien civilzation, but proven by scientist this Face is just a natural lanformation.",2,1,0.8684066534042358,1076

when scientist decribed this face they seen on mars, ""A shadowy likeness of a human face"" ""an enormous head"" ""Was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called -Cydonia"", yes it does sound like it would be an alian based on how theyre decribing it, but wouldnt you think it could be anything other then an alian?, i think so, not everything with a shadowy like figure of a human has to be an alian, it could be anything really. Like just some natrual figure on mars. therefor this was not an allian artifact on mars, turns out it was just some natrual figure on mars.",2,1,0.825382649898529,1229
aca3239,"We humans have been trying to discover aliens for more than a million years. Why have we not found them yet? We have been up in space multiple times and we have had yet another more multipe times sent space robots that went into orbital. So ask your self this question why have we not found aliens yet?

I think due to evidence that it is a natural landform. I think it is a natural landform because in paragraph one it states that ""...when it spotted the shadowly likeness of a human face."" When I read this I then concluded that it only really looked like a human because of the shadows that make up the ""eyes, nose and mouth"" in which makes this rock figure looking as if it has a face. I do think that is a natural rock landform because God created the earth so that only people would live on earth. Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. Another example of why that the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform is because it states in the text on paragraph seven that ""There was no alien monument after all."" This is poroving that even scienctists have conculuded that there was no landform on mars. Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to ""face landform"". Though due to the pixalation i think that it did not look like a face anymore. The scientists should have put each photo in the same pixilation because it would have been an accurate demonstration over the years and how this rock landform has formed.

Based on the evidence from the article and my past knowleadge I have conculded that this rock landform is in fact a natural landform that aliens have not created/ made this face looking landform. So what do you think?",3,1,0.7827661037445068,1681
4b920ac,"In 1976, the Viking 1 set course to mars. When the Viking 1 was orbiting mars, the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. It looked like a shadowy human face. The question everyone is asking is who are what made this? Was it aliens or is it just natural. If you ask me, this strange looking thing is just a natural landform.

I think it is a landform for a couple of reasons. My first reason is that only a few of my friends from NASA believe that this strange landform was really made by aliens. I also think that this is just a landform because the photo that we took was not very clear and that could have made the landform look like a face.

I also think that this is just a land form because the time of year that we took the one of the photos. When we took the photo in 1998, we took the photo during the winter on Mars and it made Mars sort of cloudy and the Mars Global Surveyer had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the strange landform. Some of my friends from NASA were saying that some of the so called ""alien markings"" were hidden too.

My final reason for thinking that this is just a landform is that when we took the thre pictures and compared them, they all looked different from each other. The picture we took in 1976 looked like the face the most out of the three pictures. The picture we took in 1998 did not have the same details of the first picture and it did not look like a face. The picture we took in 2001 did not have the facial features of the first photo either. Therefore, I think this is just a landform

In conclusion, I think this is just a landform because only a few of my friends believed that it was done by aliens, the photo we took in 1998 was different due to some of the factors of weather, and all three photos looked different from one another.      ",3,1,0.8162199258804321,1817
d1568dc,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" the author writes about a mesa on the surface of the planet Mars. This particular mesa recieved a lot of attention because the shadows resmbled a human face. Many conspiracy theorist believe this means there is alien life on Mars, but they are incorrect. The ""Face"" on Mars in simply an ordinary mesa.

The original picture of the ""Face"" was captured in 1976. Since that time ouR camera have improved, allowing us to see images more clearly. The original image was blurry and indistinct, leading may people to believe that the mesa was evidence of alien life on Mars. Again when the second picture was taken in 1998 camera were improving, but not as efficient as the camera used to take the final picture. Also in 1998 the picture was taken on a cloudy day, obscuring the mesa behind clouds. The 2001 picture clearly shows an ordianry Martian mesa, not a ""Face"".

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!""(Garvin, Mars global surveyor). If there was any sign of alien life, activity, or even past activity NASA would be able to see it in the 2001 picture of the ""Face"". However the picture clearly shows an empty mesa. This

Martian mesa can even be compared to an ordianry Earth mesa!

This mesa attracted a lot of attention from the media because of the way the shadows fell across the mesa, creating a face-like illusion. NASA captioned the original photo ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors wanted to engage the public and they definetly did! While many people believed the shadows created the image of a face, NASA clearly stated in the original caption of the 1976 photograph that it was simply an illusion caused by the shadows.

The ""Face"" is not really a face at all. It is a huge rock formation/mesa, similar to many other mesas on Mars. The only thing that made this particular mesa any different from every other mesa on the surface of Mars was the coincedincial way the shadows fell across it. Many people thought this ""Face"" was evidence of life on the surface of Mars, but the are wrong. This is because the picture would show signs of life or activity, but there were none. So, in conclusion the ""Face"" is not and never was an ancient alien monument.        ",4,1,0.8544778823852539,2519
