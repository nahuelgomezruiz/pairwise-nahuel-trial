158ddca,"The author of this passage has supported his claim that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers extremely well. The reasons he supports himself well is by stating how Venus was probably the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and how it would be a good challenge for scientists to accept.

In paragraph four, the author asks this question, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" The author answers the question by saying how Venus might have been like Earth. This statement sparked curiosity among the scientists, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" With this statement, scientists are eager to find out if this is true, and if it is, what happened to the life forms? The author proves that Venus being similar to Earth is worth the dangers. Knowing what happened to the life forms on Venus may help prevent the same disaster happening on Earth.

The main dangers of visiting Venus is the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the extreme surface temperature, and the unbelivable atomospheric pressure. To continue research on Venus, scientists would have to get up close. The author uses the word ""challenge"" instead of ""risk."" This describes how pursuing Venus would be innovational to mankind. The author supports this claim by talking about how researchers are testing new technology to continue work on Venus. ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" When scientists achieve this goal and do research on Venus, who knows what is next in space exploration. Venus being a challenge to study is worth the dangers because if scientists conquer this, they will be able to conquer anything.

In conclusion, the author supported their idea extremely well with concrete evidence that exploring Venus is worth the risk. With the satement that Venus could have held life forms and water shows that studying this planet is neccessary. Also, when we study Venus, it will prove that humanity can face any challenge that comes its way.  ",5,2,0.9004210829734802
1bd1109,"Did you know that Venus was a planet and is that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit? Well it actually is and Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus is sometimes called the Evening star because it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Making it simple to spot in the sky.

Venus is referred to as ""Earth's twin"". Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Also it is the closest according to distance too. Earth and Venus are like neighbors. Venus was just around the corner, Humanshas sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. The previous mission was unmanned and for a amazing reason. No apcecraft have survived the landing for more then a few hours. we should send more. Despite the danger but we haven't touched venus more then three decades.

The author supported the idea of studying this planet is a worthly pursuit because we have to know more about this planet then just knowing we are the closest out of all the planets. He stated,""Our travel on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". The author claims that space is an important study according to this statement.                   ",2,2,0.8113977313041687
3a737b0,"Why do you think that author think we should studying Venus, and is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in presents? I think we should study Venus before trying to visit or exploring ,because you never know whats going on up there. Venus is like the first or second biggest planet on earth. To me i think Venus is a cool planet to study and learn about. In the passage I read that venus has the hottest surface temperature. In paragraph 3 it says on the planet's surface the surface tempertures average is over 800 degress. If i had a choice to go to Venus i wouldn't go, because i feel like its not save to go there because anything can haappen. Some people that do go up there 50% of them either cant breathe, get hurt ,or other things happened. Venus has about 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets . In paragraph 4 it states that the value of returnig back to venus seems indisputable, but what are the options of making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive. So therefore I agree with the author. I think you should study before trying out new things and exploring venus.",2,2,0.848421573638916
611c12d,"It is clear that in the the article ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"", the excitement for a possible oppertunity to explore Venus runs deeply with the author. The problem with excitement is that it clouds judgement, Venus should not be explored without a proper motive or strategy, and they don't yet have that. The article did poorly in convincing me that the pursuit for venus is worth it.

Venus is an uninhabitable place. Dispite the information that would vastly improve our knowledge about venus, it proves quite difficult and could put a life in danger. The heat on Venus greatly surpasses that of the average on earth, it is said in the article,"" Tempratures average over 800 degrees"". The author of the story is working around the fact that its probably not going to happen, within a lifetime at least. The article mentions that Venus is reffered to as ""earths twin"", and it appears to be unmistakenably true at one point in its lifetime, given it's know structures and landforms, but Venus is no longer firtile and cannot support that of even our most protective items suitable for space.

NASA's involvement in attempting to send humans to venus is highly advanced, although the productivity is not the fastest, they are indeed attemting to get somewhere with their research. The best thing mentioned in the article was of the, ""Vehicle hovering over Venus"". It sounds like the title of a really interesting distopian sci-fi book but no, that was the big idea that the author referred to. I did quite like the idea only in that it was somewhat sensible, to collect data from up high, though unfortunately the density of Venus' surface wouldn't allow for any colection of data.

On the contrary to what is beleived to be, the author provided good evidence as to exciting new ways to hopefully one day be able to learn more about Venus, and understand our solar system at the very least by one planet more.",3,2,0.875850260257721
89add51,"in the ""challenge of exploring venus"" the author says that venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He supports all his claims further in to the article. he says that it is one of the hottest planets even though its not directly next to the sun the pressure holds the heat in, its hot enough to melt certain metals but he says that scientists ar taking the risk because its so far the only planet that could have been just like earth in the past. he brings up some of the characteristics that venus has that earth has too and he also brings up some of the physical features that makes them think there was living life on it at some point and time in the past. Our sister planet could have been covered in many oceans and held many kinds of life. just those little two facts bring the scientists in and make them wanna learn more about it. venus has rocky sediment, mountains and craters which earth all has. in order to explore venus they would have to be very careful because how deadly and dangerous it could be they bring up a spacecraft very relative to a blimp that they would be able to use and study and explore venus from a very safe area without causing any harm to the scientists on board they would be about 30 or so miles above the surface area it would still be very hot around 170 degrees farenheight but do able because the blimps outer layer would keep the scientists from burning up or getting too hot . they are coming up with other ideas other than the blimp like spacecraft they havee also come up with the idea to send a roverthat is made out of silicon carbide that has lasted 3 weeks in venus like conditions. the scientists only want to learn more about venus mostly for its path and what it could have looked like and to make a breakthrough with some big news that venus was almost identical to the place we live on called earth. as the author says in his last paragraph ""striving to explore venus has value not only because of the insight that will be gained but out of your normal human curiosity"" for the last point he says "" our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" which in total supports his whole statement of is venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",3,2,0.8932062983512878
a9c7fb1,"Venus is an unknown planet, despite being so close to us. It is hostile, and no human could survive on its surface. But some think it is possible to reach the surface and study Venus up close. It has many dangers in the way of progress. It's clouds contain sulfuric acid, and it's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The pressure on the surface in 90 times greater than that of Earth, and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It boasts the hottest surface tempuature of any planet in the solar system, and has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent bursts of lightning that impeade probes and rovers exploring the surface. But some think it is still a possiblity to go to the hostile planet. The author of the article believes it is possible to reach and explore the surface despite the danger. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in presents by explaining that it may have once been earth-like a very long time ago, that it is the closest planet to Earth for exploration, and how scientists are now testing ways to get on the surface without any casualties.

The author gives support by explaining the fact the surface of Venus was once earth-like, and that it had many of the features that Earth has on it's current surface. It is amazing to think that such a unsuitable planet could have once been eath-like, but being near as it is to Earth, it is not entirely impossible. The author tells how many have made comparisons to Earth based on it's current surface, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because of it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system....Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The feature the author talks about are very Earth-like, so the possiblity of it once being like a ""utopain"" planet are not dim. He point out the valleys, mountains, and craters that can be seen around the surface. Maybe the craters were the cause of the hostility on the planet, and it's inhabitent were wiped off the planet by a imbargement of asteriods and possibly comets. And the crashs caused climate change, thus shifting the planet into it's demise for supporting life. But if it is so close, couldn't this be true, that Venus was once in the Goldilocks Zone, and while Earth formed, Venus was the planet of life. After all, it is our neighbor.

The author continues to support his ideas of exploration by pointing out the fact that Venus is, at most times, the closest planet to us, Mars being a bit more distant. It is often called our sister planet, as we have very much in common with Venus. The author explains how closly were related to Venus, and why we chose to explore it, ""Often referred to as Earth's 'twin', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desity and size.....Futhermore, recall the Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" It is about the same size, and relativly close, so it is one of the obvious choices. It is also noted that in space, time matters. If you don't get to the planet quick, your ship could lose oxygen, your could run out of food, or you might miss the planet when it goes through rotation, making harder to get home and less likely to reach the planet another time. Although it is hard to make the surface of Venus, it is our closest option and is more like us, thus making it more suitable. The question for scientists is how. This question may not be solved for a long time, but already, scientists are making advaces toward the next landing on Venus.

The author also supports his idea of Venus exploration by showing ways that people are making advaces toward a possible landing. New technologies and old technologies alike are being combined to make the landing last, and for futher exploration. The author shares some of the developments made by scientist recently, ""Imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitide to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground condition by staying up and out of thier way."" Another advance includes using new material the protect electronics and other computer equipment in the hostile environment, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of the Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" NASA has made significant advance in the pursuit of getting onto the most Earth-like hostile planet in the solar system. New discoveries continue to be made, and soon the expedition for Venus will be underway.

The author has supported his claim throughout the article that studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining it's likeness to Earth, it's closeness in proximity, and how scientists are advancing closer toward the goal of landing. Humans have done things like this before. The 1969 moon landings, for example, were thought to be impossible, but through human drive and motivation, we achieved this goal, and now we are faced with a new challenge, Venus. But with the same human drive and motivation that put man on the moon, people will explore our ""twin"" planet, and uncover it's greatest secrets. ",6,2,0.8894246816635132
