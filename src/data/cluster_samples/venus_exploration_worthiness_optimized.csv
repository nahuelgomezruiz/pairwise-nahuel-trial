d8d8de9,"The planet called "" Earth Twin"" is called Venus. Venus is the most alike planet to earth density and size. Another name for Venus is the ""Evening star"" because not only its the closest to look liike eath density ans size it also the closest planet to earth. So at night you can look you and see Venus. Venus even had some space craft send to the planet but noe of the survived the landing on the planet over three decades.

This planet surface and atomspher both have extream conditons. The atomspher of venus is 97 percent carbor doxide and the clouds rain corrosive surface acid. And the surface is over 800 degrees fahreheit and the peressure is 90 time than earth. Even thought Mercury is closter to the sun Venus has the hottest surface. And thats because of the weather patters and the voclanos. Or it because the powerful earth quakes or the lighting strike.

The NASA want to still try to send thing to this planet it lear thing they cant touch. They know the probly they have to solve before they really send anything up there. There was people in the 1800s trying to figur out Venus mistorys and people even going over that to see if they miss anything. Alot of researchers was trying to past the challenge but didnt know how because the heat of the planet was messing upthe rocket they was sending and there tryinh to fiuger out that problem now.

Well, Venus sometimes called the "" Evening star"" is one of the bighest points of light in the night sky. If you didn't know venus is actually a planet. In the solar system Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is the closet planet to earth in terrms of density and size. In this article there are many things you don't know about venus. Venus is more than three decades. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. The vaule of returning to venus seems indisputable. Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. Venus from a ship orbiting or hoveing safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

We are facing the challenge of Venus, it is really valued not only because of the facts and information we get out of this planet. Instead, humans are curiose and looking for more evidence of what we are going to face in the futur. We should learn more not only on the outter shell, but more deeply in the inside.

Venus is the second planet in the our solar system(Milkyway). Also ot is one of the brightest points in the sky at night. As the closest plant to Earth in terms of size, density, and distane. The surface of it is full with valleys, mountains, and craters. Not even one single spacecraft have reached to it before. 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, forming a blanket for the planet. This planet has the highest temperature in the whole entire Milkyway. NASA(National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have not stop sending spacecraft to land on Venus.

If we could lend on Venus later on in the generation, could there be any living organisum that lives on that plante? There could be a possible chance since Earth is not the only planet in space. There are more things tha we need to discover. You would never know if there are creatures like ous that have a abiliy to explore space.

d39dbc5,"The author should continue studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. because in the text it talks about how they had to stop studying Venus since the spacecraft would not survive more than a few hours.

What they know about Venus is how thick its atomosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, and its challenging are the clouds of sulfuric acid. The planets surface the average surface is 90 times much more then on earth. And it has the hottest temperature in the solar system even if Mercury is the cloest its not as hot as Venus.

Since no spacecraft survived the landing more than a few hours. They would stop because it wouldn't survive. It explains why they haven't got a spacecraft to stay at Venus. And what I would have to guess on why they didn't survive is probadly because how intense Venus really is. Now by intense I mean how strong the planet really is. Now more then 3 decades Venus has not had a spacecraft there. They haven't gave up. But they're trying to find a way.

NASA is working on other ways to study Venus. NASA thought about sending humans to study Venus. But the conditiond of venus makes it hard, because they have to orbit the planet and they cannot take samples like rock or gas. The only thing they could get to study Venus are images.

I still think the author should continue on studying Venus despite the dangers it presents.   ",2,2,0.8652229309082031,0.0,0.0,0.0
6edf6de,"Im going to tell about how the author of the article ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is trying to convince people to explore and stuying one of our 8 plants called ""Venus"". He starts off by geeting in detail with describing how vevus is by stating "" Venus sometimes caleed the Evening Star,is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky,and saying venus is the second plant fro our sun. Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too. He also discribed the plant as a cloud-draped world, and says maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched downn on venus in more than three decades

The author also gets into some math into this by breaking down some percentages that venus has compared to other plants by saying. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus "". he also says that one the plants surface , temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and theatmosphere pressure is 90 times gretaer than what they have experienced on earth. Venus has the hottest surface tempertature of many plants in our solar system, even with mercury being closer to the sun. He basically telling us about the percentages and the deepest amont of venus and other plants we didnt reaserch about.

In more of the storyhe tells you the things yo are exprcted to see on venus. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth. The planet has a surfae of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. He changes the subject and goesminto the NASA and how they have ideas on sending humas to study venus. he describes how going out there would be like by saying imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above theroiling venusian landscape. Also at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but tha air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth",2,2,0.8156622052192688,0.0,0.0,0.0

Venus could be worth visiting. Astronomers say that Venus once was the most Earth-like planet. Venus was probably covered with large oceans. Venus could have supported many forms of life. It is simply to dangerous to land on venus. Even 30 miles above Venus's atmosphere is dangerous. Although it is survivable by humans, having the right equipment for the job is key. Most metals would melt right away if they were to get close to Venus. Silicon carbide has been tested in a chamber of simulation of Venus's atmosphere. It lasted up to three weeks in the chamber.

Going to Venus would be extremly dangerous, but it would be worth trying to find out if there was actually any living life on Venus. Any sample from Venus's ground would be outstanding. It is just simply to dangerous for that to happen.   ",2,2,0.764927327632904,0.0,0.0,0.0
eb1d4a6,"I'm going to talk about the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". By this unknown author who wrote this. My name is PROPER_NAME and this will be an essay so bare with me. It will be long and show how the author supports the idea. Without a further due, lets jump right into this essay.

The author talks how the idea of people can adpat to the conditions of Venus and settle there like our home planet Earth. There are some problems that he think are challenges. The planet is 90 times the amount of pressure we have on Earth. Most of the air is carbon dioxide blankets that covers 97 percent of the planet's thick atmosphere. The temperature is around about to 800 degrees on the planet.

Venus that has the hottest surface temperature that would melt anything on contact including people. Also, it would crush you or anything else like a piece of paper. There is also bad weathering that cause problems. Like for example: erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

On the postive side, we can make a vehicle that will let us float above the fray. Use solar energy to power the vehicle to float. We can avoid the unfriendly conditions on the ground. The degress will be around toasty at around 170 degrees. The pressure will be around sea level on Earth. The radiation would not exceed Earth levels.

This why I think the authors idea is good. It can help us show how humans are progressing through the years of tech advancements. This world will become someday extinct and we will somehow surivive. NASA will always find a way to expand. Thank you for reading this essay and I hope you enjoy.",2,2,0.8293592929840088,0.0,0.0,0.0

The author supports the idea of exploring Venus. The author shows many intrests the planet but also in the technology used to explore it, from ""Venus being earths twin"" and ""possibly supported life with large oceans long ago"" to ""mechanical computers"" that can potentially last in the harsh environment. The author also wants to know the options for making this mission both ""safe and scientifically productive"". One of NASA's possible solutions is to allow scientist to float about 30 or more miles above the land to avoid most of the storms and the harsh ground conditions, The conditions will still be rough with tempratures of 170 degrees fahrenheit but the pressure would be close to the same pressure of earths sea level.

In conclusion Venus may be a hard planet to study but our scientist are working hard on many solutions to traveling to that harsh planet.",2,2,0.8280678987503052,0.0,28.57142857142857,28.57142857142857
6f65423,"The author supports this idea by introducing us to the planet and stating key points about Venus early on in the passage. In paragraph one he says, ""In our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun."" and that's showing us that the author is intrested in studying Venus. In paragraph two he begins to talk about the different speeds in which Venus, Earth and Mars travel. The author states in the third sentence of paragraph two, ""These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus"".

As the author states in the third paragragraph, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit..."" Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author has to be fully intrested in Venus to know this much about the planet. You will learn that Venus is a dangerous planet and not even metal can survive on Venus's surface. The author states in paragraph two, ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". Venus is so dangerous that in order to visit the planet you can't even land, you would have to float about 30 miles from the ground.

In conclusion, Venus is not impossible to visit in fact NASA is still working on getting astronauts there with different approaches. As the author states in paragraph seven, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber stimulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" so, Nasa is still working on getting humans there. In paragraph eight it states that, ""Striving to meet the challenge presemted by Venus has value..."" meaning that venus is a special place and getting humans there will be exciting. So many humans are curious of what's on Venus because it's so hot there and getting humans there would be a big accomplishment. ",3,2,0.8588916063308716,0.0,0.0,0.0
3902084,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about how dangerous other planets are to humans but in this passage they specifically talked about Venus which happens to be one of the most dangerous planets. Venus is the second planet to the sun which makes the surface very hot and dry and so it doesn't allow for us humans to land there easily and just explore. The passage even says ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" this shows how we can land on Venus and survive but the conditions make it so hard that humans usually die after a while. and even though Venus is a dangerous planet I understand why people explore the planet regradless.

Scientists and NASA have been trying to figure out if we can survive on a different planet or if would be able to build there and have people live there because the world could get over populated. So, when they search new planets it's not for fun its because they want to see what else is out there and as dangerous as conditions may be I repsect the people who go out and discover things we didn't know existed. As of right now the only way to find out more about Venus is by going there, however, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, some simplified electronic made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."" These projects could work one day and we wouldn't have to risk lives to find something new, we could just use the resources found here on earth.

The very last sentence of the passage says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. I strongly agree because if we didn't take risks and put ourselves out there we wouldn't have half of the stuff we use on a daily basis.

05c94e5,"Studying Venus

Planets are a very interesting, Earth, Mars , Venus, and others are all planets in the solar system. Venus is an interesting one, and one that not much is known about. This is why Venus must be explored and have discoveries made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why that is. The planet Venus would save time while visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made.

Venus is worth being studied because it is one of the closer planets to Earth. It is a planetary neighbor to earth. In the article ,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states,"" Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Par. 4).Because Venus is a closer planet to Earth time could be saved and there would not be a worry about time being lost as if traveling to a different planet.

Secondly, Venus has similarties to Earth, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Par. 4). Just like on Earth Venus also includes the same quality land features. Going to Venus and discovering the way the land features form would be a magnificent thing to discover and being able to see how the earthquakes and natural disasters appeasr.

Lastly, while exploring Venus, reasoning for the temperatures and dangers of Venus could possibly be prevented. If someone was to discover how to prevent the dangerous factors then maybe there would not be a problem to land on Venus. Making that discovery is important and would help scientists learn more about Venus. The article states,"" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth""(Par. 3). Taking time to discover Venus could be a great thing.

Although Venus is a dangerous Planet with crucial temperatures, exploring the planet could be very beneficial to scientists and multiple discoveries could be made. Venus is a planet that is worhty of being studied and there are reasonable factors as to why it is. The planet Venus would save time when visiting it, it is much like Earth, and if it was researched many important discoveries about the weather could be made. Contributing to the study of Venus may be challenging, but in the end would be quite beneficial and would make a difference. ",3,2,0.8802578449249268,0.0,0.0,0.0
3c12de3,"The Trip to Venus

Have you ever been looking up in the sky and see somthing that youve never seen before? Well thers a good chance that was Venus. Venus is the one of the neighboring plantets next to earth and also the most simular. In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author talks about how NASA has been studying Venus and there plans on it.

First of all, Venus is the second planet from the sun and is somtimes called the ""Evening Star."" In the passage the author tells of how Venus is called Earths ""twin"" because of how simular both a made, with both of them having around the same size and density.

Next, the author was able to tell why getting to Venus was the actuall hard part. Venus has been hard for NASA to figure out mainly because of its atmosphere and ground conditions. In the story the author describes how Venus's atmosphere is mainly made up of carbon dioxide and that the clouds on Venus are made up of sulfuric acid which is corrosive. Then if you where to make it to the ground the avergae temperature is said to be around 800 degrees farenheit. So thats why in the passage he described Venus as inhospitable.

Finally, NASA has been trying to make trips to Venus but most dont make it through the atmoshere or only last a few hours on the ground. But as said by the author NASA has been brainstorming ways they could get to Venus and collect data. One idea mentioned by the author is that NASA would to make a blimp like object that houses people in it to hover above Venus's atmoshpere making them unharmed while they collect data. Another idea is that they would use technology back from WWII which didnt use electronics but gears so that putting that on Venus's atmoshere wouldnt break down as fast due to it's conditions.

In conclusion, the author states good evedince that in the future we might be able to know more about Venus and maybe even send people there. With knowing more about its physical properties NASA might be able to do more missions's there and maybe even send a person there.",3,2,0.8293147087097168,0.0,0.0,0.0
7617ff3,"Does the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" really support the exploration of Venus? The facts and the reasoning in the authors article shows strong supporting details that they in fact want to explore Venus.

So therefore, in paragraph 4. The text states,""astronomers are fascinated by venus becuase it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"", the author is stating how Venus might be able to save us in the near future. For example, if a natural disaster happened and human kind was in danger, where would we go? As the author states Venus is very similar to Earth, if we do the reasearch and get the materials to be able to live on Venus it could ultimately save the human race.

Also, there are still some downfalls about Venus's condictions, in paragraph 6 it states, ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmoshpere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."". This is the author giving evidence that there are still complications to be fully awhere on what is on Venus, there could be a possibility that Venus is inhabitible.

In conclusion, yes, the author does support the exploration of Venus. The author gives many reasons why we should and why it is more than likely be a planetary visit. Even though there is many downfalls about Venus it could possibly be very helpful in the near future.",3,2,0.8847207427024841,33.33333333333333,0.0,33.33333333333333
33b606a,"The claim that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"" is not well supported by the passage. Throughout the passage the author explains why Venus is exceptionally hard to explore, why it hasn't explored it in 3 years, and even the intrigue that it causes. It doesn't explain the benefits of exploring Venus and it doesn't explain the benefits of our curiosities. The passage explains more of the dangers of exploring Venus than why it is worthy to be pursued by any reason other than curiousity.

The first paragraph introduces the reader to the planet Venus describing it as an ""Evening Star"" that is easy to view from afar, but challenging to view up close. The author starts with these statements, leading the reader to the question ""Why is it challenging?"". Through the second and third paragraph it explains why it was explored and why those missions failed. This gives the reader knowledge on what Venus is and a picture of what Venus looks like, while also explaining some of the many reasons that Venus can't be explored.

In the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh paragraphs we see a shift in view point, where instead of focusing on the expected ""Why should or shouldn't Venus be explored?"" the author then moves to the topic of ""Why are scientists wanting to explore Venus?"". The answer? The author explains that the reason behind all of the searching for ways to explore Venus is merely curiousity. The author also explians the approaches to explore Venus, that NASA is taking, because scientists are curious. In the paragraphs it doesn't suggest that exploring Venus is worthy, as it only explains why exploring Venus has failed, how any missions now would fail, and what NASA is doing to approach their curiousity.

In the conclusion paragraph, the author explains that the challenge that Venus presents is what fuels the curiousity of many scientists. It also states that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."" proving that the author was not focused on proving that it is a worthy cause but more of saying, we should not be grounded because it's dangerous.

The author's suggestion is not well supported by the claim, as it has been shown that the author only focused their attention on how dangerous and scary Venus is and not on how exploration of Venus could be beneficial to understanding and history. The author's claim would have been better supported had they focused on the benefits of exploration and why the attempts to explore Venus are important, other than the filling the questions that are asked about the hardly known planet.

56ae3e1,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus, a article about the risks and benifits of exploring such a inhospitable planet. Yet, the Author does provide some insight on what humans could and can do to survive an expedition to Venus. Giving information about what NASA is doing to surive the conditions of Venus and other ideas that could help to properly understand and learn about Venus. The author does support his idea with very good points, but it does depend on how well those points stand.

One thing that is quite obvious is the fact that the author is biased on their idea. Which is not really suprising when their article is entirely based on trying to convince others that sending missions over to Venus is a good idea. They first describes the conditions of Venus itself, showing insight on why people haven't sent expeditions to Venus. They even state the Venus is quite inhospitable and does not support any suitable life for humans. The author tries to provide a window into both worlds, one where scientists try to find a way to explore Venus, another where people just know that Venus is not a place for people to live. They try an approach to shoot down common fears on why exploring Venus is a bad idea, bringing up one problem and then answering it with quick and simple methods. One idea from NASA is to have a blimp-like vehicle float 30 miles above the surface to survive from most of the heat and acidic atmostphere. Then they bring up another issue about exploring Venus, the technology. Where their idea is to use old 1800s mechanical computers to survive the climate, but to also provide a way properly explore the surface without the issue of frying modern computers. The author brings many solutions to many problems, so that the exploration of Venus could be possible by brining ideas together and have those ideas be the basis of a mission to learn more about this fiery of planet of our solar system.

The solutions brought up by the author show a new perspective, or bring insight on one that people already have, about sending people to Venus to quench a thirst for exploration. Where the idea of having a blimp float 30 miles above the surface to survive the deadly climate. Having old 1800s computers to play an important role in helping to learn about the planet, where heat or acid could destroy an iPhone or a laptop in seconds. Brining machines in to do the exploring for us with technology that hasn't been used in little over two centuries. The risks are great, but the benifits of learning about a planet that hasn't properly been explored for the entirety of our existance could enter people into a new age of exploration based on curiosity and adventure. Just as the author states in paragraph 8, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author greatly supports their idea to explore Venus, with some quick and simple methods, but also with the idea of bringing people together to go out and explore further than Venus itself.",4,2,0.8477530479431152,0.0,0.0,0.0
47b45a7,"Venus is often referred as the Earth's ""twin"", mainly because of its similar density and size. Its close distance to the Earth makes an easy planet to explore. However, it presents a challenge because of the conditions.

The author shows the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit because of its similarities with the Earth. Astronomers believe Venus might have been covered with oceans and contained various forms of life. It has other features that resemble those of the Earth, including a surface or rocky sediments and formations like valleys, mountains, and craters. Its proximity to earth makes it the nearest option for a planetary visit.

The author also gives examples of ways Venus can be explored even with the dangers it brings. The NASA is working on solutions that will allow humans to visit the planet. A vehicle that hovers over the planet will avoid ground's conditions. Temperatres would still be high at 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the air pressure would be similar to that of sea leve. There would be plenty of solar power and radiation does not surpass Earth levels. These are hard conditions that are still survivable for humans.

However, using a spacecraft as such does not allow for photographs, videos, or rock and land samples because of the distance. Consequently, researchers are working on innovations that will enable machines to last longer. The NASA, on its side, is working on simplified electronics made of Silico Carbide that are tested in a chamber that simulates Venus's harsh conditions, and have lasted three weeks.

Another project uses the old technology of mechanical computers, which played and imprtant role during World War II. Unlike modern computers, that are quick but delicate, these do not require electronics at all. Instead, they are made of mechanical parts that can be made to endure pressure, heat, and other forces.

Though a dangerous task, the exploration of Venus is worth the risk. The author thinks the challenge has value, because ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". His examples of similarities with the Earth and inventions made by researchers show that the mission should be conducted, because now there are solutons to the problems the conditios of Venus causes.",4,2,0.8555082082748413,0.0,0.0,0.0
729d99e,"How many people do you know that would like to go to the Moon? Many I'm sure, but why would they want to risk their life just to see another planet? Well, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has a theory that this exploration is a very worthy pursuit despite its many visible challeneges and dangers.

The authors first allegation is that human curiosity is taking over and will lead us to many finds beyond our planet of Earth. While you may not worry about Venus and what it looks like every day, just think, wouldn't it be facsinating if there was another hospitable planet besides Earth? Venus was once the most earth-like planet in our solar system, and that statement is what makes astronomers so intrigued by the idea of someday going there. Venus is known to have a sufrace of rocky, valleys, mountains, and craters, so what would make the mission safe for humans and effective for scientists?

The author also says, although nondeliberately, that humans have the supplies to one day explore Venus, but doesnn't make the effort to. The author makes the conclusion that ""peering at venus from a ship safely far above"" isn't going to cut it. The words used by the author are supported because not only can you not get reliable resources, they could be ineffective and just a waste of time. Instead, researchers need to take the challenge and work on innovations that allow machines to last long enough to contribute to the exploration of Venus.

While the author believes there are a number of dangers in the exploration, it is stated that instead of feeling like there is a risk to you, think of them as challenges that you will one day overcome. As of now NASA is simplifying electronics because modern technology may be quick and powerful, but it becomes delicate in aggrivating physical conditions such as heat.

Overall, the author is stating that despite dangers presented, exploring Venus could be a great investment for the long run. So next time you are asked of what the future could hold for you, just think it may be a trip to Venus.                      ",4,2,0.8231327533721924,14.285714285714285,0.0,14.285714285714285
8fe06d7,"The author doesn't fully support his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He displays too many downsides of the exploration. He frequently brings up how risky it could be. The benefits are acknowledged, but briefly. The author spends too much time focusing on how the conditions are far from easy when he should have been focusing on why traveling to Venus is worth it. His idea is that the trip is worth it, but most of his writing describes why it is not.

The author first brings up the environment of the planet. He describes the hot temperatures, stating how it averages to be over 800 degress Farenheit. He also adds in how it has the hottest surface, despite Mercury being closer to the sun. This is obviously way too hot for human beings. Then, he discusses that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times stronger than that on Earth. This environment is much more extreme that anything we're used to. Plus, Venus experiences earthquakes, lightning, and volcanoes that are way more powerful than the ones on Earth. The author provides information on all the reasons why our species could not live there.

Furthermore, he admits that NASA does not even have the needed equipment to safely and effectively travel to Venus. He only mentions that they are currently working on it. The author gives the idea that Venus could be studied from up above, in a vehicle hovering miles away from the surface. This way, scientists could get an insight on what's going on down there. However, doing that would prevent seeing most light, since it isn't able to penetrate the atmosphere. Even though the author does say better approaches are being worked on, no machines are completely ready. We simply don't have the required technology to keep humans safe on their expedition.

Finally, the author doesn't support his claim that going to Venus is worth it because the pros of traveling there are kept at a minimum. In his writing, he failed to give important reasons on why going there is essential. He does bring up that it's fascinating to astronomers due to how similar it could have been to Earth long ago. However, the potential similarity it could share is not a reason to risk lives to explore it. Yes, it is beneficial to study planets other than ours, but when it's so dangerous, it shouldn't be done. If the author wants to convince people that the pursuit should be taken even though it is unsafe, he should list more reasons why than just the fact that it's fascinating.

To conclude, the author poorly explained the reasoning to his arguement. He spent too much time hightlighting all the dangers presented. He should have gave readers better valid points to travel to Venus. Instead, he repeatedly wrote about the extreme conditions, or the lack of proper technology. Too much time was spent on the wrong side of his claim. The author should have supported his idea with reasons other than just pure curiousity. The cons outweigh the pros.

c11476d,"The author made it clear to us why they feel like we should persue Venus. The author had many facts to back up his idea that exploring Venus is worthy but can be dangerous. The author described many aspects of what could happen if we go to Venus. The author is very interested about Venus and gave a thorough explanation of why we should pursue Venus despite the dangers by giving supportive details of how it relates to planet Earth.

The author gives descriptive details on how Venus is just like earth and why we should go there in paragraph 4. The authors says that ¨The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters¨. This part of the text makes it to where Venus is a safe place to go because it ¨includes familiar features¨ as earth does. Which makes the reader believe that their is another planet like earth out their in the Solar system. Venus having ¨valleys, mountains, and craters¨ shows how closely related the planet Venus is to Earth. By the author putting this into the text give us a visual of what Venus really looks like if we touch down and started to build a civilization their.

The author gives the reader a realistic condition of Venus of why it is worth it but dangerous. In paragraph 5 towards the bottom the authors describes the conditions by saying ¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth./ Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans¨. The author gives us a little scare of how it is dangerous because the temperature levels is ¨at around 170 degrees¨. That is very high and seems that no one would be able to survive there. The author also says ¨air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth¨ which is saying that the air level of 170 degrees is as close sea level so we could pontentially survive it. The author ends is by saying ¨Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans¨, which explains why he believes that it is dangerous but since it is survivable it is worth the try.

Furthore more, the author gave great explainitory details of what could come if we live on Venus, that of the good and the bad. Throughout the text the author explains ways that Venus is dangerous but can be liveable towards humans. The authors explains ways of how the human population is trying to get to Venus by telling us about NASA

tryna build technology that is suitable for those conditions. The authors explains their idea with strong arguments and facts that make it understandable to theit idea.",5,2,0.8125511407852173,25.0,0.0,25.0
721fac1,"In this article, the author presents us with facts about what makes Venus dangerous, and why we should try to study it despite the danger that comes with it. He provides many examples of the harsh conditions of Venus, but is lacking when it comes to reasons why we should continue to study it. Safety is the number one priority in all scientific research, and I don't think this author provides enough reasons why studying Venus is worth the risk. Furthermore, when he does provide his reasons they are quickly proved wrong by himself in later paragraphs, which lowers his point immensly.

The author writes a lot about the challenges of going to Venus, and what makes Venus so dangerous. Yet, he barely provides any information on why it is important to go there. In paragraph 3 he writes, ""...such an environment would crush even a submarine accustumed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" He also writes about the extreme temperatures, 97% CO2 atmosphere, sulfuric acid clouds, and things like erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. All of these challenges and dangers in one paragraph, and not even one reason why we should face these challenges and go there. In the next paragraph he says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" He also go on to provide more information about how similar Venus is to our own planet, but still, no good reasons why we should spend money researching this planet. When you are talking about visiting a planet as dangerous as Venus, you need a lot of good reasons to go there. However, this author is lacking in his reasons, which makes him sound unprofessional.

Without providing a lot of research, it is hard to agree with what the author is saying. He does not do a great job of proving his point that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In paragraph 5 he writes, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusion landscape."" At first, this seems like a viable solution to the dangers of Venus, and sounds like a good way to safely research the planet more closely. However, it's quickly shot down and is identified as a less than desireable solution in the next paragraph by the author himself. He states facts about how we wouldn't be able to capture photographs from this distance through Venus's thick atmosphere. He also points out that we would not be able to retreive samples of rock, gas, or anything else from this distance. This is the only good possible solution to the dangers of Venus that the author has presented thus far, and he debunks the idea almost entirely in the very next paragraph. This is a terrible way to convince the readers of his opinion; that, despite the risks Venus presents, it is a worthy pursuit to study it.

In conclusion, the author presents more ideas that go against his point, than ideas that acually support it. He does a terrible job of supporting his ideas, and when he has a good point, he quickly proves to us himself that it is not a good idea at all. Taking all of these things into account, we can conclude that the author does a very poor job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
