Two guys named Rich, Jummy carter, Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO and they are not alone according to Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. The single best argument agianst the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election would be thrown to the house or Representatives, where state delegations vote to the presdient. Because each state casts only one vote to give th voters vote to the president and another for the congress,

The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the wall of the people, And if an electoral tie seems unlikely. A the base level the electoral colloege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner takes it all system in each state , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chances at win at these king of states for the president. They focuse only on the the tight races in the ""swing"" states. There many things in the Electoral College that many people on they outside don't know what the Congress or the up running presidents are struggling it looks easy on the inside bu on the ouside wow they have a lot to work on.

I think we should keep the Electoral College because it gives the people opportunities to vote for electors and presidents. If we vote for popular votes then that doesnt mean people truly know what president they want to run their country. When we vote we are actually choosing our electors when we vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Some people think that the Electoral College was unfair back-then but what about now. Over seventeen sates did not see the candidates at all,Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. When you vote for a presidental candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College. One reason is certainty of outcome,Two Everyone's President, Three Swing States, Four Big States, and yet but not least Five Avoid Run-Off Elections. These are all practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Now in my case that is wrong because wether you vote or not everyone person should have the right to see what the president is doing to their country. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-democrats in Texas, for example,or Republicans in California. Each party selects a slate os electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an person or thing in the past that cannot fit in the present. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.                                                                                                                            ",2,5,0.8553133010864258,2675

In my opinoin I think we should absolutely keep the Electoral College system. I think we should keep the way we elect our presidents because it's a non-democrac way. It's also easy and fast by killing two birds with one stone. Our founding fathers compromised the Electoral system and since we can't get rid of our admendments and change the Constitution I don't tink we should get rid of the Electoral College system. It may be old, but new things aren't always the best things. I think if the Goverment wanted to change it they should try it on a state first before they roll it to the rest of the nation, and we all know the goverment isn't that smart and won't do it because we are their test animals.

Another reason to keep the Elctoral system is because it's easy and effciant. If we just have the elction just be based off votes and not popular party it would be messy. The Electoral College System allows certainity of outcome. No run-off election because mostly likely there will be no tie. No arguing about the president being from a certain place or region so that state favors the president. Winner-takes-all system allows the people to pay close attention to the election. Swing states allow a little excitement during the election because some states like Florida you don't know which way they are going to go.  Big states also like Florida gets the president on the edge because the can loose every small state and still win with the big ones.

270 votes are not a lot of votes to win an elction with, but every vote counts. Some people may not vote because there are only two parties that most of the nation only cares about the Republicans and the Democrats. Some people dont like tovote in fear of their party not winning due to its unpopularity. But everyone should vote to express there politcal power. That's why we should keep it because if we change it we're changing our minds in the way vote.    ",3,5,0.8778190612792969,1943
9504e97,"first of all I'm going to argue about changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States. the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting the a president that out to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.

Second off, but each party, selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet it happens rarely. Also there are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or coservative reasons.

Thirdly, a dispute over the outcomes of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dipute over the popular vote. The reason is the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. in [ 2012's] election, for example obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because almost all staes award electoral votes on a winner-take-all-basis, even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide of electoral-vote victory in theat state.

Finally, the Electoral College avoids the problem of election in which no candidates recives a majority of votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoal votes, respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presendential elections process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

269e81f,"Dear Mr. President,

As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first admendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a ""popular"" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Best-laid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the ""priveledge"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted canidate A, but North Dakota voted for canidate B, canidate A is bound to win because Florida has twenty-nine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first canidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing.

Sincerley,

df3f185,"Dear Mr. Senator,

The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,"" states the article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

To begin with, the Electoral College is the cause for many issues in our nation's presidential campaign. First of all, voters sometimes cannot even control whom their electors vote for. Ergo, one may vote for an elector of our favorite candidate's party, however, we don't know if that elector will go back on his word and vote for another cadidate. The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. Aside from that, their is the worrying aspect of a tie occurring. If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. The article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41, 971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii had voted the other way"". This says that if those people had just voted for the opposite person, then there would have been a tie between the two candidates. Yes, those numbers seem large, but in comparison to the number of voters that there were in those years, they're a small fraction of them. This shows how close elections are with the Electoral College.

Aside from causing issues in the United States, the Electoral College is extremely unfair to voters. The article, ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state; they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit ""swing"" states. ""Swing"" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. '

To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, ""The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!""    ",5,5,0.8768262267112732,5367
