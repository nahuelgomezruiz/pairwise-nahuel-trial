830530f,Venus exploration I can tell the author cares about venus by putting down many ways humans can exploer it from going there he says it was very worthy of going we would just need a blimp like vehicle too hover over 30 miles above the land becuse the surface of venuse is very hot just in the blimp hovering over 30 miles would be 170 dagrees but where the blimp is sitting its at sae levels on earth. They are finding out ways too make electronics go onto venus because there is a lot of danger if we put a human on venus 170 dagrees is too hot for the human body unless they got the blimp at freezing tempatures the people inside will burn righht up blood will boil and people will get heat strokes. But if we put electronicson the planet that can survive the tempatures we might not have a problem with people being burned alive and we could actually exploer the lands of Venus we could make vheacles out of strong silicone for this mission it would be easier too make vehicle out of the stuff.,1,2,0.7364939451217651
1dee883,"Venus also sometimes called ""the evening star"" is consider one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is considered a ""twin"" to Earth because it is the second planet from sun and becuse it is the closest to Earth in size and density and also the closest in distance.

Venus also neighbors other planets an example is in paragraph 2 ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These diferences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to Venus. because Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""

Venus has surface temperatures that are up to ""800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the atmosphere is ""90%"" stronger than what we experience on earth. Venus also makes up ""97% of carbon dioxide"" so we would not be able to breath with also the planet being to hot to step on. they have also had unmanned missions on Venus for example in paragraph 2 ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" NASA is also working on some other approaches to study Venus for example in paragraph 7 ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamer simulating the chaos of Venus's surface aand have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""

NASA has also planned to take a look at technology called mechanical computers, how they were developed? An example would be in paragraph 7 ""These devices were first envisioned in 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during World War 2."" NASA is hoping in the future to make a sucessful test launch to Venus.",1,2,0.7772935032844543
0b64865,"In ""The Challenge of Exploration Venus,"" the author did a really good job supporting her ideas. In the first paragraphed the author explained what Venus is and where it was located. And then they explained how Venus was the closest planet to Earth in terms of size, and distance, then they talked about how they didn'd sent send a human their at first (paragraph 5). They also talked about how NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and how ""peering from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate to dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective"" (pargraph 6). NASA is also working on other appoaches to study Venus. For exanple, ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have benn tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions (paragraph 7). And the finnal thing they talked about was how ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itsself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidting endeavors (paragraph 8).

ea0d62c,"There are many challenges stated in the article about exploring Venus. In the next paragraph I will write a claim on how well the author supports the idea of studying Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers and an explanation of the evidence to my claim.

In my opinion, I think that the author didn't do a very good job on explaining the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because the author didn't give much evidence that it is about the pursuit being worthy. In the article the author explains a lot about the challenges of exploring Venus like the extremely hot temperatures and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,"" but doesn't explain very much about it being a worthy pursuit. The most that is talked about it being a worthy pursuit is getting insight on the planet like getting samples of the sediment on the surface of Venus and possibly getting the history of the Earth-like planet that is in our solar system.

In conclusion, I think that the author did not have very many good explanations for studying Venus on being worthy pursuit despite the dangers. ",2,2,0.8158971071243286
6539b8d,"The author is trying to slowly but surley teach us about the""evening star"" which is venus. Although we can examine the planet from a far it wouldnt be of any use if unable to look at the planet closley. Also called the earths twin which only means their close in density and size and close in distance at times. Numerous spacecrafts have been sent to explore the cloud draped world and every mission was unmanned since no spacecraft managed to survive a landing for more than a few hours.

Venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and contains highly corrosive sulfuric acid which wasnt safe for ant man or woman. These facts are little to none to what we could learn if we advanced our technology and support on the idea of exploring venus. NASA had thought of an idea to get closer to the planet which involved a blimp like vehicle hovering over the planet safely. This planet has value and our exploration shouldnt be limited by danger our own curiousity will lead us to explore deeper and ever far more than needed.",2,2,0.8505517244338989
7959082,"The author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit because, venuse have been the most like earth planet in our solar system. they belive that long ago venus was probably coverd with large oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.""venus can sometimes be a nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". NASA has been thinking of many ideas to help humans explore venus, possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray of venus. bump like vehical hovering over 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. like a jet airplane travel at ahigher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the deadly ground conditions by staying up and out of the their way. researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus.

NASA have come up with example of tool that can help build a safe ship for human to travel to venus. some simplified electronics made of silicon carbibe have been testred in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in venus conditions. mecchanical computers which is an old technology might help people explore venus. peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited on ground. most light cannot penetrate the dense atomoshpere, rendering standard forms of photograhy and videography ineffective.

Even though venus is the close to earth twin there are still many dangers to exploring the planet. the atmospere contains 97 percent carboin dioxide. the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. on venus surface tempertures aveage over 800 degrees fahrenheit. the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experiance on our own planet.

The condition on venus are far more extreme then anything humans can encounter on earth. the enviorment would crush even a submarine diving to the deepest parts of our oceans. venus has the hottest surface temperture than any planet. high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eurupting volcanoes. powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value. because human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enveavors. travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore venus more. venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and inovation.

i think that the more NSA workes together to make tool to go see mre of venus them they will be able to explore more anytime.",2,2,0.7337746024131775

To begin with Venus and Earth have somethings in common even though Venus may be a some what dangerous planet there are some things that they have in common. Something that the author said was "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth."" In other words what the author is trying to say is that Venus maybe once had the same features just like Earth does today. But now it's all dry. There are some features that Venus has and Earth too. Venus has a rocky sediment and has valleys, mountains and crater just like Earth does. Another good reason we should study Venus is that maybe one day the Earth were in right now may dissapper and we would have to move to a different planet. Studying something would be bad we all have to try new things. Even though Venus sounds like a very dangerous planet are could be some benfits to exploring new planets.

Witch gives us all the reasons to find out more, after all wouldnt you want to know what your liveing by? In the artivcle "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the auther has meny great points describeing why we need to know more about Venus, and why studying Venus is a worthy prusite despite the dangers that may come along with it.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the auther talks alot about why we need to explore Venus. He/she says how no humen has ever been to Venus and how it may be for the best because no space ship has lasted for more then a few hours on Venus. In the text the auther said,"" Numerous facotrs contribute to Venus's reputation as a challangeing planet for humans to study, despite its proxinity to us."" The auther is saying how althow resrving Venus may be dangrous it is worth it to know more about the planet. The auther tells how NASA is working on differnt approaches to study Venus and how they are looking back on old technology called mechanical computurs, witched played a inportant role in the 1940s durning WW2, but was orginaly invented in the 1800s. The reason why they are thinking about useing mechnal computurs is because they are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

All together NASA is trying to find new ways to study this misterous planent that we live so close to. It may take years before we can truely study Venus but in the long run knowing more about Venus will positivly effect us just due to the fact that we know more about our surroundings and mabye one day, far into the feature we will find a place in Venus, a place where we can call home.

c7463ad,"The author in ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus,¨supports the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is a planet in our solar system and the second planet from our sun but also sometimes referred to as Earths ¨twin.¨ Venus is close to Earth my density and size and occasionally by distance.Not one spaceship has touched Venus in more than three decades and because of the issue of the missions being unmanned and no spacecraft survived the landing. Studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger because astronomers are fasinated and NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because astronomers are fasinated by Venus. In paragraph four it says ¨ Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well be once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar sytem. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.¨ This means Venus could have been a planet that was more like our planet Earth and had similar features. Similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. This features that Venus has means that at one point Venus could have been a planet just like Earth is.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because if NASA is compelling an idea for sending humans to study Venus it might work. In paragraph five it says ¨NASA´s possible sotuion to the hostile conditons on the surface of Venus would alow scientists to float above the fray¨ This means scientists would be able to float above the fray with NASA´s possible solution. In paragraph six it says ¨Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of Venus.¨ This means researchers will work on inovations to make machines last very long and can last for them to have as much information about Venus when they get back to Earth ground. NASA is also working on other ways to help on studying Venus. For example in paragraph seven its says that ¨ some simplified electronis made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulated the chaos of Venus suface and has lasted three weeks in such conditions.¨This means that they made eletronics with silison carbide and tested it in a chamber to venus and lasted three weeks.

Venus is a worthy pursuit to study because NASA has compelling ideas and astronomers are fasinated. NASA did a test of silicon electronics that lasted three weeks and astronomers say the planets surface has similar features as Earth. The author is right on studying Venus.

aba7d09,"Was there another Earth like the one you are living on right now? I and all the NASA researchers ask you this question in a sense that you will understand. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Venus was probaly covered with oceans and life forms. We know this because Venus has surface features that look like Earth's. Through the use of technology, researchers found valleys, mountains, and craters on Venus, leading us to think that it is extremly similar to Earth.

Venus is the second clost planet to the sun and regulates a 800 degree temperature on it's surface. The atmosphere is also covered in thick sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide clouds (author 3). These vile conditions make it impossible for technology to touch the surface. You may ask if it's impossible why are we still trying. The answer is that Venus is extremly similar to Earth and could possibly reveal secrets of the universe.

Through technology researchers have found reminents of valleys, mountains, craters, and oceans. Making it possible that a form of life was once there. Was there life? What happened to the planet? These are questions that are fueling researchers to uncover the true nature of Venus.

In conclusion Venus is analogous to Earth. Reminents of oceans, valleys, and valleys were found. From this knowledge scientists infered that Venus could have supported life. Unfortunelately we are having trouble testing this theory since Venus' surface is 800 degrees. If we can somehow collect data from Venus depsite the danger, it would be vital for Earth and the human race in general.",3,2,0.7778964042663574
859c17a,"The challenge of exploring Venus they sent people to go discover it and it is really close to Earth it's closer than any other planet's. Venus is called Evening star it's one of the brightest points of the light in the night sky. It is going to talk about how it is going to be different there and it's simple to see from earth because it is kinda close.

The National Aeronautics and space administraion(NASA) has an idea of sending humans to go explore Venus to see how it is there. They want to study it so they know how life works there so scientists could know about it. NASA possible solutiin to the hostile conditions on the surface Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. The temperatures woild still be hot at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the pressure would be close to sea level from earth.

NASA is going to be working on studying venus like some simplified electronics of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulatiing the chaos of venus's surface. So they can get an idea how it is going to be when they get to the surface so they will be ready because they already did some testes for that. The only thing it only lasted for Three weeks in conditions.

There is another project from an old techology called mechanical computers. Computers existing in 1800s may sound shocking but they calulations by using gears and levers they dont not require electroics at all. Now we have computers that are more powerful, flexible, and quick but they tend to delicate when it comes up to extreme physical comditions.

To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of its insight to be gained on the planet itself. Humans will lead us into many equal intimidating endeavors. On earth shouldn't be limited by dangers and doubts to expanded.

NASA should just study it more to see if there is any danger that can cause to humans. They should do more testes and try out new things and not to be scared of it because if they don't study it well and send people to live there they might now live the best. So NASA did a good thing about sending people to study venus. They will know now what they could had done better for the next time they send humans back there again.         ",3,2,0.834370493888855
89b52db,"Visiting a different planet would be nice. Exploring different places would be nice. I think there should be another planet or another place to visit and get out of this boring place we are at right now. I think that we should explore new places and not just stay where we are at now. That is boring just staying in once place without traveling. So I think that scientists should figure out something about Venus, that way we can all travel to a different place.

Doing research on another planet would be great. I think we would all figure out something to do and not just do nothing. Venus could be a great one to study and acknowledge. You can figure out so many things in Venus. It would not be much of a difference from earth because the Earth, Venus, and Mars are like neighbors. The only difference is that the speeds are different and that means that we are sometimes closer to Mars and other times Venus. So if scientists or people from the NASA go visit Venus and try to see how it is and how it works, we would be able to find a solution to visit that planet.

The reason why nobody has landed on Venus in more than 3 decades is because they can not last more than a few hours. That is why no one can go land on their planet. Humans can not go on it which makes that difficult for the planet to be researched and touched. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide that covers Venus up. Also something more challenging is that Venus clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Something else is that their temperatures average is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we expierence on our own planet. So therefore, Venus is the hottest planet even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Venus also has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning. All that makes it hard for spaceships to land.

A good reason why scientists want to research Venus is because once it was like Earth planet. Venus once was covered by oceans and could have support living life just like we have today in Earth. Today, it still has a few living lifes that we know on our own planet. Venus has a rocky surface and also includes features like valleys, mountians, and craters. Scientists might make a trip safe going back and forth from Venus, but as in right now they are making better inventions to go travel around and make it safe. They might take a chance and get their safe.

In conclusion, I think scientists should make very better inventions to get other to Venus so they can do more research. I would like them to announce how they can make Venus into another planet like ours they we live in right now. I think it would be good to make this a research and then make more good assumptions on how we can make Venus work.            ",3,2,0.7736632823944092
0ee0e5c,"In the passage the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea because it shows us the positive side as well as the negative side. For example a positive thing is Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. It is also the closest in distance too. Despite all the dangers Venus has the author wants us to examine and study the benefits and the challenges Venus has for all of us.

Here in Earth we are used to the atmospheric pressure and the amount of carbon dioxide we encounter on earth. The quote ""On the planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees fahreinheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

shows us how a negative thing is that those conditions are way more extreme than what us humans contribute to on earth. Meaning that we would not survive in Venus in those conditions. Another thing is that Venus has a way more hotter surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. This shows us how even though mercury is closet to the sun, even venus has a hotter temperature which to us that is dangerous. More over high pressure and heat, the venus weather presents additional inpediments such as erupting volcanoes,strong earthquakes,and most likely lightning strikes.

Scientists are discussing further visits to Venus. As well as astronomers think that there might have been a possibility that in venus it may well once have been the planet that has been more earth-like planet in our solar system. The quote ""Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth."" shows us how Venus one day could have became a planet just like earth and have life. Which is a positive thing because today venus still has some features that are similar to those on earth. Some of those characteristics that venus has similar to earth are valleys,mountains,and craters. In the future this could be a recall that venus can one day be a safe option for a planetary visit,space travel,and maybe one day it can have life.

The NASA has an idea for sending humans to study venus but could that really be a safe plan? There plan to the rare conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above. The quote ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface,temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahreinheit,but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth."" shows us how those would not be easy conditions for humans to travel and be survivable too. This is a risk that humans have but scientists are telling us to look at them as challenges and not risks. Which could be a negative thing.

In conclusion the author explains the negatives and positives that Venus has for us in the future and today. There can be risks but if they find a way for us to be safe, everything will be okay. Human curiosity will lead us into many new adventures in the future. Our travels on earth and beyond shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts, but lead us into the safest way possible.

7a50491,"The author uses many things to describe about studying venus. First, the author describes that Venus is the second planet from our sun, Second, he says that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of destiny and size, and occasionnally the closest in the distance too. Finally, he describe that NASA is also on other apporaches to studying Venus.

First, the author describe that Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant, but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging to place to examine more closest. Venus is the closest planet from the sun so it has more powerful than the other planet.

Next, the writer says that Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of destiny and size, and occasionnally the closest in the distance too. Earth, Venus and Mars, the other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speed. They all had a different speed from the sun. These difference speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other time to Venus. Venus is sometimes right a round the corner. In space terms, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud drap world. each pervious has unnamed, for some good reasons, spacecraft survived the landing for more then a few hour. This issue explain why not

a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

Finally, the writer describe that NASA is also on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplied electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called machanical computers. By comparison, systems that use machanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces.

In conclusin, the author uses many things to describe about studying venus. He uses so many good things to study about Venus, describing that Venus is the second planet from our sun, the closest planet to Earth in terms of destiny and size, and occasionnally the closest in the distance too. He also describe that NASA is also on other apporaches to studying Venus. A lot of people study about Venus.",4,2,0.8148902654647827
4870ad6,"The author very well supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They are very pasionate about the idea because they provide lots of facts and reasoning to further support the claim. The author uses support mainly focused on the idea in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6.

In paragraph 4, the author said that Venus is theorized to once be covered in water, able to provide homes for all sorts of little organisms. They also say that Venus might have been the ""most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" They compared it to Earth even more because of how it has a rocky surface and has similar valleys, mountains, and craters. The author spent time comparing Venus to Earth's surface and features for remote resembalance.

Later, in paragraph 5, the author mentions how NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has ""one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's ""twin"". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and ""avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way."" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.

Moreover, the author gives reasoning that ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannnot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Researchers could also not be able to take any samples of anything from Venus from a distance if NASA were to proceed with the blimp-like plan, meaning that the researchers would have no other choice but to go down onto Venus to take samples, even though it's dangerous.

The author demonstrates how the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining many supporting reasons. They make it obvious that Venus is indeed safe to visit under the right precautions and that, with all the facts provided in paragraphs 4,5, and 6, it is a planet that us survivable for humans. The author supports thier standpoint fairly well with all the information they provided, even referencing NASA. This author fairly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",4,2,0.8142229318618774
51d1a18,"The author of this article did a decent job at explaining why studying Venus is worth it despite any dangers that it has. They don't really explain why we should risk ourselves to study Venus but rather how we could do it. The author talks about how NASA have an idea to hover people above Venus and sending machines down to the surface of Venus.

The first thing that the author talks about is NASA's idea to hover people over Venus to get a closer look at it. In paragraph five it says, ""scientists to float above the fray"". It also states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". This dosen't give us a reason that Venus is worth exploring even though it's risky. It only tells us about ow we are able to get a closer look at the planet with our own eyes an not just some pictures or videos. Informing the reader about how to do something won't make them believe that it is worth doing.

The second thing that the author talks about is getting machines on the surface of Venus. In paragraph seven it states, ""mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"". It also says, ""looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"". These quotes demonstrate that the author is more focused on informing us on how we can do this rather than why we should do this. If people don't know why they should do something, then they wont care how they should do it. The author should have put more evidence on how we could use what we learn on Venus in stead of how we could get there safely.

In conclusion, the author didn't do the best job on explaining why it's worth to go to Venus because they focused on how we were supposed to get there. If they didnt just talk about how we were planning to get people and achines there, then it would have been alot better for explaining why it's worth it to study Venus despite of the many dangers.",4,2,0.8373841643333435
e35f6ff,"The author does not support his idea well that studiying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author talks about people being facinated with Venus, that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in proximity and features, and that it would be cool if humans were able to explore Venus. What he does not talk about well is the why. Why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Here is a part of the artical where the author talks about why it would be cool to study Venus. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,""(paragraph 4). The author mentions humans being facinated with Venus and how the planet was once Earth-like. This information does help us see how it would be cool to visit Venus and it tells us some information about Venus. On the other hand the author doesn't give a solid reason for why studying Venus is worth it and despite the risks. ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,""(paragraph 8). The author does not tell us what the insight is that will be gained from exploring the planet. Also what does human curiosity leading us into other endeavors have to do with how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Their reason and support for studying Venus is weak. The author trys to use their own opinion to convince the readers that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The author aslo doesn't give a sound explanation as to how the danger of heat can be overcome for enabling the trip to be successful. ""Some simplified eclectronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions,""(paragraph 7). The author explains that there is a material that can survive on Venus for a little while. A problem to this could be that the metal might actually not work on Venus because since no one has ever been ther how would they know exactly what it is going to be like. That is why they are going there in the first place to explore Venus. They could have totally messed up on the calculations of surviving on the planet and it might be a failure. The pros of this mission are far less important than the cons to this mission. If they succed then they can say they know what on Venus and can gain some information. If they fail then people can die, a load of money is gone because of the time, energy, and resorces put into the exploration are gone.

The author does not support his idea well that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They only give a few reasons why the trip would be worthy. They use their own opinions as facts trying to pursuade the readers to agree with their ideas. They also don't fully explain how they can by pass the dangers involved with this exploration study on Venus. Since the author has used their opinion as facts and cannot explain without a doubt that this pursuit can be successful despite the dangers I have to say that they did not do well at supporting their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

21133d1,"Throughout the essay ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author does a good job of suporting the claim that studying Venus is worth while. The author provides examples and counters them with ways to overcome said obstacles, and uses specific examples on how NASA plans to study and explore Venus.

Venus has many different aspects and characteristics from Earth, such as the temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth. Geological and weather challenges include lightning strikes, erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes. The author mentions all of the issues regarding visiting Venus in the second and third paragraph. Although the author mentions the challenges, he/she is doing that to completely inform the reader by giving all the details and then finding ways to counter those obstacles. The author brings up the question of ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" in the beginning of paragraph 4. This shows how the author brings up an argument against the initial claim, and then proving that argument wrong to make the claim more valid. Next, in the fifth paragraph, the author uses evidence from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to provide ways to escape the hostile conditions of Venus. For example, one idea is to allow scientists to float above the fray in a blimp like vehicle. Again in the second paragraph, the author again mentions another plan by NASA to study Venus. This plan is to use simplified electronics made of silicon carbide because they could survive Venus's surface for a limited amount of time. By using specific evidence and research already done by NASA, the claim that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" is being proven well. Lastly, in the final paragraph, the author does an excellent job of summarizing the scientific gains that would come from exploring Venus. The last line states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" which is a fantastic summary of the article and shows how well the author presented and supported his claim.

In conclusion, the author uses excellent writing skills to support and validate the initial claim, and does it very well. The author thoroughly analyzes each danger and possible solution, and also states the positive effects of traveling to Venus. By using specific evidence and research from NASA, and countering all of the dangers with possible solutions, the author supports the claim brilliantly.",5,2,0.7800585031509399
80b646c,"Imagine being convinced that completing a certain task is worth any strugles along the way, and you end up severely hurt because of it. That is exaclty what the author of this article is trying to do. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author does a poor job of supporting the idea that studying a planet as dangerous as Venus is worth it. Studying Venus is a terrible idea because technology isn't advanced enough, it would take years to discover anything beneficial, and the costs' of this, both in money and lives, are outrageous.

Technology throughout the world has improved since the 1900's,however, it has improved on Earth and in regards to Earthly tasks. When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion"". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but ""survivable"". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.

Exploring unmarked territory isn't something that can be done over night. Unmarked territory is exactly what Venus is. Even if technology did evolve enough so that humans could visit this planet, it would takes years, decades, even centuries, to accomplish. In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving ""what if"" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, ""Is it worth the wait?"". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.

Assuming that the exploration of Venus does eventually happen one day, how much money would go into it, how many lives? These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, "" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.

In conclusion, since our technology isn't advanced enough, it would take far too many years to do, and the human and money costs wuold be outrageously high, we should not explore Venus. Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents. For one, there were not enough facts presented in the article that were beneficiary to the idea. Also, of the pros that were present, the cons outweighed then tremendously. Exploring Venus proves to be a terrible idea, atleast until we are actually ready to do it.        ",6,2,0.7998590469360352
