64e9501,"Millons of fatal crashes are reported to occur each year. Most of these crashes are reported to have been due to driver error. What if there was a way that we could still be able to get to the places we want to go safely, and efficently with the use of a vechicle, but without actually having to drive. The new innovation of ""Driverless"" cars could have so much to offer. Driverless cars could let people with disablities be able to go places on there own and become more independent, it could also begin steeply decrease the amount of crashes each year that are due to drinking and driving, and it could save our economy plenty of money and gas.Due to the better fuel efficency a driverless car has to offer.

Many of adults of the legal age to drive are unable to be indepent in getting

places on there own due to a disability that makes it unsafe, or even impossible for them to drive. With the invention of driverless vechicles, it could potientally provide a way for people with disabilites to be able to drive, and own there own vechicles. This would be a great thing for people with disabilites, because it would open alot of opputunites that they never have had the chance to do before, and overall would give them a sense of indepency.

So many people have been victums that have been severly injured, or even in some cases killed due to a crash caused by a drunk driver. If driverless cars are legalized, this could change dramtically decrease the amount of cases of crashes due to drunk driving that occur each year. If people were able to safely get home on there own while under the influence, without even having to step behind a wheel it would create better and safer enviorments for anyone planning to travel on the road.

Alot of people argue that driverless cars would be pointless because the average everyday person would never be able to afford one. Although even though buying a driveless car could be at intial buy a pricey investment the end result you would actually save money. The driverless cars that are already in process of being manufactored are all extremly fuel efficent. As stated in the article the driverless cars are forseen to only use ""half of the world's fuel of today's taxis"". If driverless cars use better efficeny, than the average person will then spend less money on gas. So after a few years the intal price of a driverless car will be a good investment to make

Driverless cars truly do have alot to offer. They are very innovative and they can improve the lives dramatically of everyday people, including those with disablitles limiting them to be unable to get places on there own. Drunk driving rates could steeply decrease if we begin to use driverless cars, and even though it is a more pricy investment, the amount of money, and gas it can save the average everyday person will make a driverless car a smart investment.

As Luke Bombeger (he was a man who porticipated in this act) once said "" I'm greatful for this oprotunity! It made me more aware of people and other countries and their needs.""

Not only will you just watch the seas or help the people but you can also do things such as, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games games to pass the time. You will do thease things because even though you are on a hard trip that you should be working on, you have free time. In fact you will have LOTS of free time! This will help you think clearer while you are working hard on those bing wide oceans.

As you can see you have a lot of hard work to do, but i assure you that you are going to have the time of your life on the big ocean. There are so many sites to see, creatures of the sea to hear, and work to do. There are so many things you could be doing. There are so many sites you could be seeing. This is one big oprotunity of a life time. You can get SO MANY adveantages such as not being drafted for the war. You could take thease advantiges from your hand RIGHT NOW! You could be riding the sea and be in so many places that are only in your wildest dreams. You could go and see an amazing exotic animal if your lucky! Now see, why would you pass this off. Why would you say ""No thank you!""? Because you have the ocean. You are a Seagoing Cowboy. This life may be hard, it may be frightaning, it may even be a lonly trip for you, but you will meet some of yourbest friends fo a life long on this trip. You could get over your fears of the waves in the BEST WAY POSSIBLE!!! Amagine this life. Amagine riding the waves with a big smile on your face. Amagine your freinds being right there by your side.

6bd8e65,"Seagoing Cowboys aren't like pirates, or like land cowboys that rob people and do aweful things. They help out people when they are recovering from the terrible things that hitler and World War II brought them. When you sign, up you don't have to risk doing army time and going to fight becasue when you are a seagoing cowboy, it counts for your service time. Also, you get to see the world and how other people are living and how cultural our world is. In this essay I will tell you reason why is I know I did the right thing by sighning up to be a seagoing cowboy, and why you should sign up too!

The most important thing that I was able to do was to help out my community and beyond. When people were suffering from traumatic losses and hunger I was able to help heard and bring animals to the Jews, Germans, and Aisans that were all suffering from the outcome of the war. They were in poverty and were in need of people to safely get livestock to them so they could eat and be whole again. I think that by sighing up you get that sense of heroism and you know that you did a good deed. I think that by also sighning up it really helps life or death problems.

When I sighned up I knew that I would have to go fight for my country and maybe even die in battle. So, I turned 18 during my first trip and I knew I would have to stop what I was doing and to go serve in the army. But, when I went to go speak with the army, they said that helping to bring food to families wounded in the war counted as War time. I overjoyeced becasue I loved to do what I was doing and I didn't want to have to end that. Also because I didn't have to risk dying! Phew, thankgoodness! So thats why you should also sighn up so you don't have to go out and get shot! I also realized how big of an oppertunity it was and how much of the world I was going to be able to see.

The cattle-boat trips where an unbelievable oppertunity for a small-town boy like me! I had the benifit of sight seeing Europe and China. I saw the acropolis in Greece, and took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, with streets of water! Water people, I mean who would pass that oppertunity up? I toured an excavated castle in Crete, and awed at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Grece was very speacial, and China was amazing! When you take the chance of going out and doing things in the world you get see magnificent things. Even when your traveling between countries, you get to experiance marine life and biology!

See? That's the thrill of it all, that you get to be a real hero, not die, and see the world through your own two eyes! Now people might say that you don't get to see everything and you need to ""die for your country."" Don't listen to them, they are just being cynical. You make the decisions and you don't need one bad review to change how you feel about doing something! People might just judge you, but guess what they are just jealious that you get to see the world and be a true hero. That is why you should sign up to be a sea-cowboy. You never know where tomorrow will take you! I'm going to try to immitate Uncle Sam now, We need YOU to be a seagoing cowboy!",5
43fc6ff,"They say venus is worth studying because it is closest to earth at some points. Venus has far too extreme climate then any human can survive even more encounter. Venus as they call it is a evening star it is the brightest points of light in the night sky.

Many people refer venus as earth twin it is the closest plant to earth in size and density. They have been many shipps and crafts try to land on venus but many of them are unamed succesfull. they could land but not last more then a few hours. Venus is unsafe for humans because the surface can get up to 88 degrees fahrenheit we would burn alive we couldnt last more then a couple hours there even with extremem gear. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times stronger then what we deal with on earth.

In cunclusion Venus is not really a planet we can land on and begin earth civilazatoin. It is far to extreme for any human. It is to hot as it to dense. Although venus a plant nasa would like to study more and get more infromation about it Technology way advanced now but even then it is nearly impossible for spacecrafts to land and for humans to explore.

92069ac,"Many people in today's world depend on cars to get them places. They don't realize the effects cars have on our environment and how much better things would be if we limited car usage. There is many other ways of transportation that are much easier and better for our world. I believe car usage should be limited because it will cause less pollution, it will take away stress, and it will save people money.

When cars are used, they release chemicals into the air which causes pollution. Pollution is not good for our air and wears down our atmostphere. Global warming has always been a serious matter with the amount of people who drive cars so if we cut back on the car usage, it would decrease the amount of pollution going into the air. In Source 2 it shows an example of how Paris had intesifying smog because of these cars. They banned cars for a couple days and the smog level dropped. Also in source 2 it says "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france"". When cutting down on car usage, it helps many things and can help you stay healthy and feeling good.

Another major reason we should cut down on car usage is that it will take away a lot of stress us humans have. In source 3, buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said "" It's a good opurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Imagine your driving down the road and some guy pulls in front of you without a blinker and you almost hit him, you get all mad and stressed out that you almost hit him. Road rage is very common in drivers and we could decrease that stress with limiting car usage. Also if you were to get into a car accident, that gives you so much stress which affects your everday life.

To buy a car, you need lots of money. You need to buy the car, then buy insurance etc. Why don't just save your money instead of buying a new car when you could just use some other form of transportation. In source 4 it states, "" .. Cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployes weren't going to work anyways."" This shows that many people don't have the money to buy a car, why spend you money on a car that is not needed instead of buying something else. Cars are not mandatory, you can get to places many other ways and could save lots of money. Also you could save money on gas if you didn't have a car.

In conclusion, limiting car usage will only result for the better. There is plenty of other ways of transportation that aren't as harming and expensive as cars are.         ",4
a7efa1a,"Everyday new thing are breing created because of the advances in technology. In the artitcles ""Diverless Cars Are Coming"" the author talks about the goods and bads of a diverless car. Although the idea of a diverless car hasn't been fully develope, they predicted that it will be by the year 2020. In the my perspective I think the idea of a diverless car is bad because of the many problem it could cause.

A diveless car is not exactly ""diverless"". In the ariticles it said, "" The car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel...human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over."" This tells us that a diver still need to keep hold the of wheel and stay alert. The human still have to be on the look out and take over when their is a problem.

A diverless car is not safe because it can bring technology problems and failuar. It said in the articles,""New laws will be needed in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the diver or the manufacturer?"" This tell us that even if the diverless car is developed their will still be flaws. As it was mention in the article if someone got injured who would be at fault? If the person got injured they would blame it on the company and their would be problems.

Rule are their to keep us save and if it change it could cause many danger. In the aritcles it said, "" traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all time."" This is agreeble because its better to be safe then sorry. Things can happen when driving a diverless cars, so it way safer if that person was in full control of its car.

Diverless car can bring many accident if it is not fully developed or safe. It can bring disagreement between people if their was an accident and it is safer when the person is in control of its vehicles. Driving is already unsafe for most people and if diverless car is develope it can be more unsafe.    ",4
a56b9af,"Although, many people may think that going to Venus despite the dangers is not a good idea going to venus can also be benitfical with new safety measures, and technolgy.

One reason is, Venus is a sister planet to Earth but we don't know alot about it so we need to go there. Going to venus can be benitfical in may ways. One way is thet it can give scientist good research that they don't have. It can also give them a way as said in the article ""to examine more closely"". Lastly we could gain more knowledge on living conditions in Venus.

Even though, Venus is not the safest palce for anyone or anything to be NASA has came up with new safetey measures to ensure the people's safetey. For one as said in the article Venus is a hot place. So NASA has came up with the idea that the people that will be going to venus would be floating on top of venus so that they will not only be safe but alive. Another way to ensure saftey is to use silicon devices since metal melts on Venus, and studies have shown that using silicon is efficient, and in the article is said to last ""for three weeks"".

Furthermore, not only do they have saftey measures they also uses technolgy. From past reasearch it is known that Venus burns metal so that means that to have good resaerch you have to find somthing that is not meatal to conduct your resarch. So NASA has made another project when they look at old technolgy, and they realised that mechanical computers would help when researching Venus. Mechanical computers conduct ""calculations by using gears and levers"". Also mechanical computers does not need electronics at all.

In other words going to Venus can be very resourcful and problaly become of use in the future.                         ",3
7152619,"We live in an age of technology where one could not go a single minute without being influenced or even witnessing tech. Going off of that, technology is used more and more in the educational system, with classes using computers and i-pads for everyday acivities. The Facial Action Coding System would be a perfect addition to the educational sytem and could even make a huge impact on average people's everyday lives.

Technology in schools is a wonderful tool, offering millions if not billions of different sources and programs online with the click of a button. When used properly, students can grandly enhance their learning skills with the use of technology. However not every program, resource, or tool works for every single student, which is where the Facial Action Coding System would come in. Using this device, teachers can potentially get feedback on whether student's are enjoying what they are doing, what one could do to make a student's learning experience better, and with this device a teacher could even tell if their class is confused or bored. Since emotional expression are so important in a classroom, a teacher could potentially even modify the lesson plan based off of the overall moof of the class.

This invention is groundbreaking on it's own, and bringing it into the educational system with it's proper use and encorporation, could be of tremendous help to the United States educational system. ",3
c4d960b,"Hi, my name is Lucas and I had an amazing experience by being a sea cowboy. I got to visit many places that back then many people cound not visit. Also I made a lot of good friends. When my trip with the animals was over my friends and I would kind of have a party we would play games like volleyball, fencing, baseball ext. Like I said this opportunity opened the world up to me. I am glad that I now understands other countries needs and the people from those countries. When I was done being a sea cowboy my family and I had like foriegn exchange students stay with us. I could also teach my family about the foriegn exchange student. Like what his country was like and what animals I brought to that country. Like I said this opportunity had a lot of good effects come out of it. So if you would like to travel the world and learn what different countries needs I suggest being a sea cowboy.",2
9402ac5,"If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, because in the story it's saids that '' Face on Mars'' has since became a pop icon. If I was a scientist in NASA I would found out how did the peron face came to another planet. They have to get out the earth to come to another planet to just put your face on it out of no were. But if a person did put there face inprint on a another planet, I think they will turn into a alien. I will tell you why I said that, because people say that aliens are real and they harm creatures. Also, if I'm the scientist this will tells that a FACE on a human body doing on a another planet they should be on earth. In the article it saids: twenty five years ago something funny happening around Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for it's sister ship Viking 2. Also, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on the monitors. But now scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work,and see who's the human face or a alien face because humans on earth an aliens in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, it saids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a prioprity for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended.",1
2bb7f66,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy does sound like a lot of fun. I think being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun.

First you are helping others.

It sounds fun to do, you have something to do, you are being a hero. you get to do a lot of traveling and sightseeing

You get to see things you have never seen before.

Seagoing gives you the chance to see different when you travel. You kinda become a role model when you are a Seagoing Cowboy. You are looking out for others i think you should be responible and caring to be a Seagoing Cowboy. It could be a lot of fun and make you happy to protect people. You are making people feel safe.

In conclusion i think the Seagoing Cowboy program is good for people and they should join it. It's an important and fun job, sometimrs you get hurt and it can be dangerous but it awesome. Just be careful with dangers at sea.",2
e723c40,"We all take risks. Sometimes these risks are not worth it and very dangerous. For example, we all had to learn how to ride a bike for the first time. We thought we couldn't do it. We thought we'd fall but we all took a risk and went for it. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author is taking a risk in studying Venus and studying what our sister planet has to hold. They're taking a risk in that, worse comes to worst, it could end up nowhere and all that time and energy was for nothing. I believe that the author has valuable and logical reasons for believing that Venus is a worthy pursuit no matter what dangers it presents.

One of the reasons the author thinks Venus is worth a shot to look into is that Venus once was the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. This is important because scientists can compare and contrast Venus and Earth. Scientists can take note of what Venus had that Earth doesn't. They can find out

how the formations are similar to ours on Earth. In the article, it says that Venus still has ""a surface of rocky sedment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."". Venus being so alike to Earth is huge because that means it once sustained life. Venus supporting forms of life in the past is important but what may be even more important is Venus having the potential of supporting life today.

Another reason the author shows that Venus is worth studying in the article is by saying that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable,"". Having a plan B is definitely important. Being able to fall back on something gives relief to most people. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author says that there is potential for Venus to become habitable again which means there is potential for a backup plan if anything were to happen to planet Earth that makes it inhabitable. This changes the game because that means there is hope if anything goes wrong in the future. Venus is worthy to look into for this reason even thought temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. I believe we can overcome that.

The last reason I think the author supports the idea of studying Venus is because of the technology we have today. The author states in the article that ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus."". The author thinks that with NASA developing electronics made out of different, more durable materials that we are getting closer and closer to discovering different parts of Venus too dangerous for humans. With a satelitte or rover made specifically to sustain the extreme conditions of Venus, we can learn so much more about Venus. The author believes that with the right materials and mindpower, we can study Venus even better without having to deal or struggle with the dangers it presents.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents in that they believe we can learn more how Venus and Earth were so similar at one point. The author supports their claim because they think Venus has the potential to become habitable again. They also believe that we have the materials and technology to explore Venus despite its extreme conditions. ",4
7b76d55,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology enables computers to identify human emotions. The invention of the Facial Action Coding System lets us read human emotions better than we do now, but is it valuable in a classroom?

In my opinion having a Facial Aciton Coding System in our classes would not be our number 1 priority, for example getting better access to wifi servers that would allow us to use our computers for projects on google without it crashing. In the other hand in paragraph 6 when the author stated ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" I really liked that idea, because it could help out some students whose strengths may not be in that subject. In my case, that could help my me on better understanding my Geometry homework, but my computer would end up crashing and the whole purpose of the experiment would be destroyed. There is another thing we could do also, we could refer back to what we used to do and just ask our teachers to help us. We do not need a computer to explain the lesson better, I have seen there are a lot of visiual learners who have questions in my class and I don't think the computer could talk back to them and give them an answer they want to hear.

In conclusion, while the idea of having a machine identify your emotions sounds cool and fun, it would not be an essential to the classrooms it would just save us money to refer to the system we use today, which is to jsut ask our teacher.",3

Thats alot of votes that electoral college needs.

In source two it says ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". More people prefer the direct vote because under the electoral college system voters vote for for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. acording to the article in reason one.""In 2012 obama received 61.7 persent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romeny. because almost all states award electoral college votes on a winner- takes-all basis"".

192c7f5,"The new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computures to identify human emotions. The process begins when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face. The fourty-four muscles in the model must move like human muscels. Dr. Paul Eckman creator for FACS calculated the emotions of Mona Lisa. I do not believe that FACS is important for the students to learn about.

This technology is not important to what is going on to in the class room or in todays world. The students in highschool have other things they have to be getting ready for like graduation. There are standards into graduating on time or even early and I am sure learning how to caluclate emotions from a computer and pictures is not one of them. The technology is in the path of achievment if the activity is in a progam by its self and not in the high school or middle school. Some students are pushing the edge to gradutate as it is. This will be something they will want to do and they cant if they are behind in their classes. These students already have way more technology on their hands now adays than they should. The technology is upgrading each day. FACS is not something that would help someones career with in the futrue. School's should be about helping kids get ready for the future. They should not make everything the students be on the computers. Some people want to contain the knowledgement about the expresstions on other peoles faces than gradution than they should take a class about FACS out side of school. The kid in elementry are not going to know what paper and pencil's even are if we keep coming up this technologys like this that we dont really need. I would not want a computer telling people, or evem myself, what mood i am in. I know what mood I am in. I would not want my parents to know if I was mad because I would be mad at them and not want them to know. If people wanted you to know their feelings they will most likely tell you how they feel. The Facial Action Coding System is the waste of a schools money. The money that is put into the FACS is way more than a school could possibly They could use the money to fix something around the school. The FACS is just way out of hand.

The new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables computures to identify human emotions. The process begins when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face. The fourty-four muscles in the model must move like human muscels. Dr. Paul Eckman creator for FACS calculated the emotions of Mona Lisa.

Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.

The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowboys, they then both signed up.

This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing.

With me saying that just by looking at a person can be deciving because you never know how the person excatly feels or what is going on in there head so therefore i belive that the facs can not tell a persons emotions.",2
c624421,"Venus the closest planet to earth

in terms of size and density sometimes called ""Evening Star "" because it is ""the brightest point of ligth in the sky""(para. 1). Venus is known to be very challenging planet to study for the scientists and NASA. The reason why it is very diffecult planet to study is because

its temperatrure is 800 fahrenheit and spacecrafts aren't able to survive. NASA has been sending unmanned spacecraft, for a good reason the space crafts have not been able to survive alone. The author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents because NASA sees it as challenge, its earth-like

and wants to know its past.

Venus is challenging planet to NASA and many scientists because of how deffecult it is to study it.Venus has a very bad atmosphere with 97 percent of carbon dioxiode which makes it hard for spacecraft to see around. According to the article of ""The Challenge of Exploring"" it said the ""Even more challenging are trhe clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere""(para. 3) What quoter is trying to say is that the NASA has to build very strong spacecraft strong enough it won't melt and a flying one. The spacecraft has to be ableto fly because if it touchs the ground it will be destroyed. Some people migth say that if it is dangerous planet why bother studying it, NASA needs to know what kind of planet Venus is for safty of earth and the people.

Venus very much earth like it was said in the article that venuis was filled withoceans long ago. The size of venus is also simialar to earth, earth and venus also travell around the sun at the different speed including Mars. Meaning that eartyh is sometimes closer to venus and sometimes closer to Mars. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been trhe most earth-like planet in our solar system""(para.4). The want to me progress in exploring Venus because they want to find more similarty between earth and Venus.

In Venus's past it was said that there were oceans. The scientists and NASA teams are trying to figure out how Venus has ended up the way it is now. Looking at the past of Venus shows that is was filled with water like earth. studys have found that Venus most likely supported varios forms of life in the past. In present it very hot and no form of living thing cansupprted by it.

Overall Venus can be studied safely by NASA and many scientists. It is worth studying for since it is so much like earth. It is always good to stay ahead anything can happen to earth anytime. So its best to study every earth-like planet .Even if Venus is dangerous NASA can change that and learn more. ",4
cbfd6dd,"Cars  are starting to beome more and more expensive everday. Why pay when a person could either usea train,bike,or just walking. Stated in soure 1 ""As a result, 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here..."" Many people are glad that they had sold thier car because it just cost to much money for others. Therefore many people need to limit their car usage.

To begin with, Cars could have many flaws that may infect the environment or humans. Stated in source 2 ""After dats of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" So because cars take in gas it may effect the environment because inside of the car is more chemicals a that comes out of the exhust system. Stated in Soure 1 ""Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be apporved this year, Mr. Goldberg said."" this may be true because gas prices may go down and the environment will stay clean. However, waiting for public may mean waiting for a couple of hours. But when having a car a person can get to their event or job on time. Stated in Source 3 ""The day without cars is part of an improvent campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" Maybe if the United States started to start a campaign then maybe their wouldn't be so much smog in the air thats pulluting the environment.

Also, in America many people would never give up their cars just for the looks. Stated in Source 4 ""But America's love affair withits vehicles seems to be cooling."" So i guess that would be a great start for the environment for America. But how long will America last with out a vehicles? From my point of view, not for long that's my opinion. Although, stated in Source 4"" Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question."" In my opinion i wouldn't take a bunch of kids on the train just to get to school or to a  soccer game and then once that is all over with then have to get back on the train just to take tem back home. Anything can happen. That's why having cars have pro's and Con's. But others may think of the train ride as bonding time or just getting to know the full team better.

Stated in Source 3 ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic."" So having cars helps everyone a lot less accidents would happen and park and sports centers are making good profit. So now everyone could be happy and go on with their life. Stated in Source 4 "" With all these changes , people who stopped car cummuting as a result of the recession may find less reson to resume the habit..."" I would totally agree with these , because when u stop driving it means more money and better health.

Finally, cars should be limited for many reasons. Limiting car usage would many better health and less gas, and also less accidents on the road. Stated in Source 4 New York's new bike-sharing program and its syrockiting bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new pririties."" Therefore many jobs aren't complainig about the less car usage and some people aren't complaining about it. Many people should stop using cars to help the environment out and to get into shape.     ",4
14d573e,"Having a car can get you places much faster than walking or riding a bike. But there's a price you pay either on gas or the co2 emisions coming from the muffler. It is extreamly bad for the planet and we need to take action. Reducing car usage will releive you and you wont be as stressed. In some countries they have a car-free day where millions of people ride the bus, hike or walk. Thats in BOGOTA, Columbia it is smart of them but its going to take a lot more to make a change for the best. (source 3:Car-free day in spinning into a big hit in Bogota)

Conjested cities are known to have smog and that is nothing but air polution. And all of that  polution isnt going anywhere. it stacks up causing a greenhouse effect and harming the air we breathe. But theres always going to be people driving cars unsless stricked rules are made up. we need to enforce that we only have one earth and everytime someone steps inside a car we are harming it. There are other means for transportation and we need to stop being lazy and carpool or take a taxi or bus and limit the emitions or else we are bound to doom ourselves in a co2 filled planet.  (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars)

But banning car driving can harm the economy greatly causing the unemployment rate to skyrocket because the car companies couldnt sell anything. And transportation keeps everything running throughout America and the world. So the greatest idea would be to create a car that doesnt burn up emitions and sends them out into the atomosphere. We couldnt just get rid or all cars because our world is dependent on them. but we should use them smarter and drive durng sertain times.

so all in all we should just keep on driving and do the best we can to stop all the air polution and try to make the world better for future genorations. and we just need to get smarter    ",3
e22abc7,"My opinion on driverless cars is that i dont think

they are a good idea because some people enjoy driving, like me for example i have never gotten the chance to drive but i would really like too. If they were make driverless cars i might have to ""wait my turn"". Which means that when the car decides that it can't handle it anymore its going to make me drive it. I would like to drive the car at all times like it says in the article."" the google simple announces when the driver should be ready to take over.

The idea of a driverless cars just make me want to know why someone would think of this i mean if you have a driverless car it ,ight toose funiction at anytime, and the driverless cars is basically all technology which mean it would malfunction at anytime just like your computure, or phone. A driverless car is a danger to society because so may things can go wrong with it. A driverless car could cause a big accedint if something goes wrong with it when its in motion.

If your cellphone or computer needs to be traded out every two years would it be the same with a car? I mean if the car starts doing things that could put people in dantger is it going to be bad.If there was to be in accedint would it be the cars fault or the drivers fault? If the car was in an accedint some people might say that it was the cars fault they might lie and try to sew whoever made the car.like it says in the article "" who is at fault the driver ot the manufactuer. No one would know so i think that the car is a bad idea.

The car might also have a positive effect like somepeople like to text and drive like they have an addiction to there phone. If someone decides that they want to send a text messege while driving they wouldn't be driving and i thyink that thats pretty cool. If tyhe cars would be invented would textuing and driving still be illegel? Cops wouldn't be able to pull you over because you weren't driving i also think that is pretty cool. That is my opinion on the driverless car.",4
3f0b178,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes the new facial recognision technology called the Facial Action Coding System(FACS). This system claims to read emotion expressions. I think that the FACS could help sience in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship and think it is a valuble thing in classrooms.

Some possitive thing about the new technology are adaptation and improvment. With this new technology we can use it to adapt different things like ads and school lessons. Ads can sometimes completely take out the interest on the viewers for the video and can be sometimes unpridictable. This has happend numerous times in classrooms when a teacher wants to show a documentary that is all ready slighty borring and an ad showing an exciting new superheroes movie comes up So now you have the entire class talking about it and not paying any atention to the documentary about Charles Darwin and what he did. Having these distracting ads adapt to what the audience is feeling could help bring down the amount of times this happens. The FACS could also help in computer lesson planing. If the FACS would be installed in a computer the computer would be able to realise that a student is no longer paying attencion becouse of boredom. So system can then improve what the lesson has by chnging the order around to give the student a more personalised lesson thus having the student learn easier.

There are some bad feedback as well. If the FACS system succeds in improving the academic scores of the students the school administration might deside that the teacher are no longer needed to teach the student, the students could just study in there cmputers. Another way the FACS could not be so good is that it is likely to be very expencive and there is ways a possibility it can malfunction and give unwanted changes in lessons and other sections in which it would be used.

In conclusion I think that the FACS could be of great help in the world if it could be 100% reliable. This system could benifit the every day use if used corectly and I think that the FACS could help sience in understanding the emotions and muscle relationship. I think it is a valuble thing in classrooms. ",3

e338a4c,"As technology has advanced, our methods of transportation have advanced with it. Driverless cars are things of the future, just as regular cars were a thing of the future in the 1900s. There will always be risks and certain safety regulations just as with regular cars but having the technology and not using it would be taking a step back.

The use of driverless cars may seem lazier or seem to have more risks than a manual car but is that not what people once thought about regular cars? Cars already start themselves and can be put in a self driving setting, so a full time driverless car would be a step in the right direction and be all around safer for citizens and drivers everywhere. Having technology run your car rather than a human, the risk and chance of a wreck would decrease dramatically. Although as of now a malfunction in the technology that could cause a crash and whether the manufacturer or the driver is to blame is a blurry topic the restriction of testing the cars would never give them the opportunity to fix the problems. Progress is slow as shown in 2013 when BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Asssistant,"" which can only function up to 25 mph which wouldn't be nearly enough to drive on actual roads yet but the progress is still there. The lack of states on board with the test driving of these cars is restricting the chances for improvement.

We, as humans, sometimes give up on things we see as impossible but things we think of as normal now seemed impossible 50 years ago. Driverless cars are simply an advancement that we're ready to make and improve but we limit ourselve sin our own abilities. It may be 20 years from now but eventually in the baby steps being taken drvierless cars will see the roads.",3
0bf03a7,"Hello, Mr. Senator i'm writing this letter to you because i'm in favor of keeping the Electrocal College. I'm in favor of the Electroral college because ""the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense"". There are five reason's im in favor of the electrocal college, One reason is the certainty of the outcome you wont win if you have more popular votes but less electoral vote ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"".

The second reason is Everyone's President ""The electroral College  requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""

In the 2012 elections Romney was popular in the south ""no incentive to campaign heavily in those states."" He doesnt have to have to campaign that much in the south because he knows those states will vote for him. The third reason is the Swing States ""The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012-to focustheir campaing efforts on the toss-up state."" Voters in the toss-up states have to pay close attention to the campaign because they're the ones that are going to decide the election . The forth reason is Big states, the bigger the states the more electoral votes they have and the presidential candidates pay more attention to those states ""a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in campaign than a small state does...""

The fifth Reason is Avoid Run-Off Elections ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the preisdential election process, reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner..."" that was my last reason i hope it stays the same to elect presidents. There are alot of people that want the elctions to change but i think this is the best way to elect presidents. Mr. senator i hope you have read my letter and that you consider wjat i have wrote on this letter.     ",2

16e1b85,"This new technology shows that no matter what, until humans are gone they will keep evolvng.

However, with this certain technology, I do not agree with the concept, while it may be practical in certain ways, at the same time some can feel, as many others probably would as well, that it could feel like it would be an invasion of privacy.

The reasons for this are as follows, when people are trying to hide how they feel it is for a reason and in a classroom, the computer would constantly be changing and running even harder to get nothing done or even hurt the learning, because no matter how much they like the subject, some students would still get bored or not engaged.

The first reason for thinking that this could be considered an invasion of privacy is that when people are trying to hide their emotions they are hiding them for a reason.

They might not have a good reason for hiding their emotions from you, but it is still their reason and their emotions, and whether or not you agree with how they're feeling and why, you have to respect their feelings.

While in certain aspects it could be useful to have this in a classroom setting, as a whole, it would not do much good.

Where the computer could change the lesson to help you be more engaged, it could also hurt in the actual learning of the subject.

Some people work in a way that, while they may seem like they are not engaged in the subject and therefore not learning anything from the subject, they are still learning just as well as if they were actively engaged in the subject.

In a perfect world, students could be engaged and still learn at the same time, while some students can, lots of students can't learn as well if they are engaged to an extent in the lesson, they may feel engaged and seem engaged, but at the same time they may forget everything that they learn within the next day.

This new technolgy could be beneficial, but at the same time it could be considered a breach of privacy and it could hurt and not do anything to change the learning of the subject by the student.

For these reasons I believe that this software should be used, but only for certain reasons, and not generally in schools.",4
571ac5d,"I think the use of Facial Action Coding Symstem is an great way to identify students emotions. I believe that most students in classrooms become sod or lonely when he/she is doing work that the student doesn't understand. So with the facial action symstem it can interact with students to change their emotions from sad to happy.

It can help change emotions by showing different thing on the computer screens,for and example a student can be sad and the facial regonition can see that he/she is sad and then put something thats joyful on the screen.

The computer can tell if the a student is pretending to be happy or sad by your mucles. Pretending to be happy or sad will cause the symstem to bringout the student real emotions. Most students try to act sad to bring atttion to themselves. If a student appears sad to another student the other students tends to comfront him/she in the wrong way.                                           ",2
4d6c690,"Facial action coding system is a system that is able to tell emotions on the faces of anyone who gets scanned by it. They're classified by: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

For a student, a facial action coding system, to be able to tell your emotions is probably something that most students do not want. It would probably make most students uncomfortable for a machine to watch their faces to be able to tell what they're feeling. But in a teachers way of seeing this. It can prove valueable to help him or her out with the student and teach them in a certain way that makes the student feel happier or they figure out whats wrong with the student.

Some evidence for this is. ""A classroom coputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" They could then modify the lesson for the student and provide more focus in a certain area. Say the studnt was confused and the teacher never knew he was confused because he never really showed it to the teacher. Well this system can do that and be able to tell the teacher that he needs help.

In the end Facial Action Coding System is a great way to help out teachers and make their job a little easier to be able to improve their lessons and make the student smarter. But students like my self wouldn't want a machine to watch them, while im doing their work, and tell the teacher what they're feeling. It would make the student want to hide their emotions even more. Plus you wouldn't want the teacher to know what you're feeling because you could get in trouble if its something bad.          ",3
451c89c,"The use of facial technology in a classroom is a fantastic idea. If a teacher knows how a student is feeling maybe behavior problems could be avoided. Test scores could start to rise because if a teacher knows how you are feeling maybe they can adjust their teaching a little, so you might understand more. Just think of all the possibilities that could happen if a school used facial technology.

Students get angry throughout the day and so do teachers. If you are hiding you are not angry and then one thing tips your boat, that can cause a big scene to occur. With the new facial technology things like this could be avoided because whoever is in your classroom would know how you are feeling today. It might even be a good thing to use this technology on teachers, not just students. Teachers get angry and upset too, so using this technology could help a student know that their techer is struggling a little bit and maybe to give him or her an easier day. This could also allow the students to help better the teachers mood so things may get a little better for him or her.

Now test scores could really benefit from this new technology. If a tecaher knows when a student is bored or confused then the lesson could become modified. The teacher would know that maybe one student or even the whole class is not understanding what is being taught. The teacher could then do whatever they think is right and try and fic the lesson. At the bottom of paragraph two Dr. Huang says what I stated in the sentence above. Think about it, test scores would sky rocket if teachers knew that a student was still confused, but maybe was afriad to ask a question. If the techers also knows a student is afraid to ask a question then that could help the teacher know to maybe boost the student's cofidence more. If a teacher could find all of that out maybe he or she could simply run through the lesson again or ask the student if he or she might need a little extra help. In paragraph three is says that this technology can already identify six basic emotions and fear is one, so if more emotion are learned and recongnized then the teacher could really help solve a problem. Many possibilities could and will come with this technology.

Students could use this not only with teachers, but also with their friends. Kids tend to joke around and not realize when they are hurting someones feelings. This could allow these kids to know when too far has occured. Like almost all kids some are afraid to stand up and say that something has hurt their feelings. This new technology may help the problems with bullying. Maybe the bystanders of the bullying would see how truly upset the attacked person is feeling. Kids do a really good job at pretending things do not hurt them, but in reality they hurt them a lot. I know the article does not say anything about this but this is a huge possibility this could be used for. We want to help kids so why not do it this way.

This technology would help so much in a school. many problems occur in schools, that could potentionally be bypassed with this technology. Students and teachers could all benefit from this technology. Who is to say that if it works in a school that more advancements could come out of this new technology. We have no idea what the future holds, but this could be a big part of our future and helping us to unerstand each other a little more. ",5

I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposebly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.

Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unfavored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.

Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president (according to source 3), there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occured in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without ""establishing a president"", though it can happen again.

We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.    ",4

Most people though that was made for aliens, but it wasn't. We discovered that there was nothing on there just rocks and natural land. And one of are partners came with the idea of a natural structure or a mesa. He think in that because if people or aliens live in there it's most be something in there that help us see if they live in there.

NASA send people to see if they could find something in there that may help us, but not.

So we decided to show it to the world because it was just a mesa. People got scared in the start but when they see that there were no aliens they relax and some studious used that for movies, books, etc.

And sense that day everyone it's okay with stuff that they don't understand, because they know that is just something new. ",3
d799e31,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers very effectively by discussing the dangers of Venus, comparing Earth and Venus, and bringing up innovative methods of getting past the obstacle of Venus' harsh conditions.

The author brings up the dangers of exploration on Venus throughout the article.

In Paragraph 3, he says, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of out oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

It is explained that the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, the temperature is over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the geology and weather make up a dangerous environment.

The author's use of these specific details and descriptions informs the reader how dangerous Venus really is, and sparks their curiousity for the benefits of exploring Venus.

The author explains in Paragraph 4 that Venus was likely much like how Earth is now, with oceans and a supportive environment for the growth of living things.

Today, Venus is rocky, with similar geographical features to Earth.

By providing the reader with this information, the author helps build the understanding of the importance of Venus to humans on Earth.

This new insight teaches readers that because Venus is so similar to Earth, it would be important to gain more knowledge on it.

In Paragraph 5, the author talks about NASA's solution of using a floating vehicle to study Venus in survivable conditions.

He later encourages people to view the risks as challenges that inspire innovation.

Innovation leads to improved technology and better, more effective ways to gain knowledge on Venus.

One example of this innovation is ""simplified electronics made of silicon carbide.""

Another example is more work on mechanical computers, that ""can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.""

The author supported his idea that studying Venus is worth the risks by explaining all of the ways that

scientists are working to improve methods of exploring Venus.

This support is useful because it can inspire the reader and provide important information.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is worth the danger by listing those dangers, explaining benefits of gaining insight on Venus, and discussing the ways scientists are currently working towards better exploring technology.",3
decd887,"""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,""

Luke had a great time going to take the cattle across water. Luke had the opprotunity to see China, Europe, taking a gondola ride, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete, then marveled at the Panama Canal. Luke was lucky to be able to get that job. People interested in joining that program shuld go out there and try to get it. There are seven good reasons people should join that area of job vacinity. One good reason is it will be fun because you could get to see some things you have always wanted to see and you could go places you have never been before.

The second reason you should join is its for an extremely good cause because it helps animals get where they need to go. Another reason people should join is because you could inspire people to do good for the world like start someting new. The fourth reason people should join is they could get an adventure out of it like luke and traveling to Crete to see an excavated castle. The fifth reason people could join is that. The sixth reason is it could start a chain of good things people do for each other. The final reason people should join is it could make people aware about other countries needs and their people.

People should join because it can help the earth them and everyone else. Luke didnt join because he knew he would get more money he joined because ""He couldn't say no. He knew it was an opprotunity of a lifetime.""

""Im grateful for the opprotunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Luke had a great opprotunity and he took it that made him get a better start in life thats another reason people should attempt to get the job when its offered. The job may or may not help them in life but it might help somebody else who knows maybe it will start a chain of good deeds.

In conclusion this could help people get a good start on life and get a start in their country. People should join becaus eanimals need their help- to get across water. Th eting their doing is for a really good cause they are trying to help animals so they basically arent put in confined

spaces. People would do that job because they would want to help animals, the enviornment, and even people and their countries. This gives people the chance to get to work better and get out of working at a grocery store.

Everyone should get out there and join. It

helps everythin and everyone.   ",2
fb9e259,"Technology adavncements have come a long way since the primitive sticks and stones of the early human era and dueing this time humans have been constanly creating new inventions for different tasks. now there is a new technology that will allow people to calculate emotions. This new invention to read humans emotions to an exceptionally accurate percent can and will be a valuable asset later in life for reading our emotions which in turn will help tell the truth when we dont want to,find what is bothering people so it can be fixed, as well as keeping people focused in their daily lives.

This will be useful in our everday lives because it is a more advanced and accurate form of something we already use daily. for instance we as humans ""calculate"" these emotions when we are looking at a friend and we can ""tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his or her face"". but despite that we humans still cannot accurately describe and convey the truth behind the emotion. we may see a person who is happy but in reality they are very down and upset or angry. this is where this new technology comes into play. With this new tecnology people will be able to find the true emotion becuase it can detect mixed emotions and the emotions that make it up. because of this peoople then can respond in a way that is needed to either make the situation better or keep it on the same topic that it is currently on. this technology could also keep people focused and alert due to this technology responding to keep attention to the task at hand. for example

"" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored ."" ""then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" Or if you are an adult the technology could respond to your emotions and change itself to fit your needs the best. This use of the new technology would help both the people of the working class and students who are trying to stay focused on the class and its lessons. in addition to this the technology can also be used for entertainment. the technology would ""make computer -animated faces more expressive"" which would ensure more happines from the user.

Because of all the advanced tasks that the new technology can do such as help tell the truth, keep attention to task at hand, help fit itself to specific needs and create better entertainment. This new technology will come with great benefits and is definetly a helpful recource that should be implmented into classrooms and other facilities to ensure a better and more productive daily life.

b1bd537,"I support driverless cars. Driverless cars could make this world a safer place. Driverless cars drive for you if you want it to. If theres a construction area, traffic hold up, or its icey out you can take control of the car. If you ever feel unsafe in the car when you aren't driving you can take control. Its not like these cars are always driving for you. These cars are very impressive.

These cars would start out very expensive because they are so high tech. It would be hard for some people to afford them. If older people buy these cars it would be better for them. It could drive for them at night if they can't see as well. Or younger people that maybe aren't the best at driving. If your parents don't trust you with your liscense these cars would help. It would make your mom worry a lot less. These cars provide safe driving.

Driverless cars steer for you, the seat vibrates when you might be going into a hazardess area where you need to take control, and it has a GPS reciever. If you have an emergency and need to text someone this car provides safety. It will drive for you when you are texting. Hopefully people won't use this car the wrong way and text all the time because you still need to be aware of what's going on around you.

You don't need to worry about wrecking your car if this car is driving for you. If you are driving there is still a chance you could wreck it. Driverless cars have motion sensors and other things that make it safe in that range.

So all in all these cars provide safety. They have so many qualities that make them usable and great cars. This could be one of the best inventions in this world. It could create less crashes, less drunk driving accidents, less texting and driving accidents,and on and on. I hope they make this car to create a better world. It would help people in so many ways. Movies fanticize about driverless cars so why not actually have and use them. Driverless cars are coming no matter what people have to say about them. If you don't agree with them don't buy one, its simple. They say we will have these cars by 2020. Its coming so quick. The destination is almost here. ",3
af44cce,"The article 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is very convincing. The author had many great points and was also compairing Venus to Earth. Definitly will grab your attention. A really great con of exploring Venus is that it has many common things to Earth. In paragraph 2 it states that Venus is often referred to Earth as a twin. Also it states that Venus is the second planet in our solar system. Another con why Venus is a great topic to explore is that if there was ever a time in a life time that we had to live in another world, Venus is the answer to that problem. In paragraph 5 it states that

NASA has particulary compelling ideas for sending humans to study Venus, but it the temperatures would be toasty at sorund 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Not easy conditiond, but survivable for humans.

Over alll I think we should continue reaseaching about Venus and exploring Venus, not only because it would help us humans learn more about our solar system, but it could be a new home for our community.",2
0d5876f,"Living on a different planet would be something amazing. Getting to see new enviorments and see new things. That may be why scientist are trying to study Venus. Venus is filled with things that show that it once was livable. Some even say that it can be the Earths twin beacuse of the similiarites they have. But it's also very difficult to be able to study Venus because of conditions that make it use impossible to be there.Which can be a major setback for people. But if they succeed it can be a big deal here's why.

Venus shows many similarities to Earth. Some people even consider them to be twin planets. We know this because according to the article on paragraph 2 it states"" Often referred to as Earth's "" twin"". Venus is the closest plant to Earth I terms of denisty and size. This shows us that their just consider as twins but they also show similiar size and density. Which concludes why they are consider twins because of their size.

This also shows many more similar things to Earth such as what it has on the planet. Eath has valleys,oceans,moutains, and craters. Well Venus is considerd to have these millions of years ago. We can confirm this because from the text on paragraph 4 it states ""Venus still has soe featyres that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains and craters. From this information we can pick out some key simliarties that show that Venus once had these things that Earth also has.

Once NASA found out about these things on Venus they wanted to explore the planet. So NASA decided to launch nurmerous spacecraft to Venus once the plant would get closer to Earth. But each spacecraft was unmanned, we know this because if look back into the text you can see in paragraph 2 it states"" Each pervious mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" From that we can pick out to thing. NASA have tried to land multiple aircrafts on the planet and that the plant was impossible to land on.

The reason the planet was impossible to land on was because the planet 800 degrees. Which made very difficult to land on. We know this is true beacuse accorinding the passage it states "" On the planet's surface, temperatures averager over 800 degrees Fahrebheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. From this information we can see how it is very challenging for NASA to land on Venus.

In conclusion I think studying Venus can be worth it beacuse it shows great potential.It also shows lots of possibilities for human life to be on it. Just beacuse of the extreme weather conditions doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to explore it. It can lead to another world that we can discover. This is why I think we should study Venus .           ",3

the Electoral college have been discovred by our founding fathers in the constitution""

why distroy something that was given to us? over time we have been voting for the Electoral College not the president. I personally think we should be able to vote based on popular vote,

Over years, we voted for the Electoral College it consits of voting for President and Vice President and the counting of the electoral votes by congress, sounds diffict right? well this is how they run things, personally I think we should vote based on popular votes because according to source 2 under ""

what's wrong with the electoral college""

many people get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate, yikes! not always do we get control whom we vote for , it all depends on the state. We should be equal, Electoral college is unfair to voters. in the same source they state that the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational harsh words? but its true.

Lets take a look at the present. President Obama who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes since were a large state we get more votes. take a look at map where its shows the breakdown of the number of electoral votes, it shows each state. many small state have less than 5 electoral votes simply because its not huge, but yet again you're voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Popular votes have many benfits such as equallty and justice's. In source 3:

""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president""

paragraph 21 popular vote was very close in Florida (2012) .

It have been said that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off a potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their states. popular votes have a chance and will be picked based on popular vote. In source 3: states that they is no pressure for run-off elections ,It's provided a clear winner , sounds good doesn't it? One single vote can decide an election sounds stressful. Popular votes are bascially stress free and in the Democrats in Texas ,Republicans in california  their vote have no effect they leave it to the popular vote.

In conclusion, popular votes have such great benfits and had more justice and give better oppourity to those who bascially are in a sticky sitution. Electoral College have so much to do with the voce president and is indirect.         ",2

f2b1720,"The face look alike that was on Mars was not created by aliens. Many people may believe that but they might just want to belive that there are such things as aliens. The face was created by just landforms. Reasonings being is, MOC, or Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture, the NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get such an accurate photo, and people over the interent were making their own stories up to make it seem like there was an alien that made that.

MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the face like rock. When they took a picture that was alot more accurate and sharper looking than what Viking's had taken, they were able to zoom in and look at more then just the face. The passage says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing . . . a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all."" Which, since they ARE scientist, they have done their research on the picture and done as much looking into as they possibly could have.

NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get an accurate photo. In the article it says, ""... Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" So, when the Viking's took the picture and the shadow was in it, it made it look something more than what the MOC had caught. The Viking's had no profesional camera to take that picture of the landform. Also, they were far away from the planet, they were circling it, so the shadow that they were seeing had to of been from something else. Or maybe from what they were even in.

People over the internet were making their own stories up. In the article it states, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" Since people believe whatever they see on the interent, they had to of jumped to conclusions and people had to of been throwing out the idea of ""Oh! that has got to be made by an alien!"" so that's what people starting saying. The NASA reveiled th photo hoping it would bring attention to Mars, but that is sure what they got. But it was the atention that an alien had made the landform.

So, with that being said, MOC had actual camera photage of the landform, NASA's Viking spacecraft did not get accurate pictures, and people over the internet were just trying to make it seem like an alien was real. That proves that the face was just a natural landform.",4

I was recently was informed that the electrol collge system is going under. It helps use with our votes. If we lose it certain American citizens votes will not be counted in for the president election. I believe that we American citizens should be able to vote. Our votes should all matter. We as a nation are one. One vote we all should be able to vote.

To begin with,

We hold our next presidnet in our hands. Thats why we should change the election by popular votes. If everybody over the age of 21 votes all of our votes would be counted in and we would pick our president. We should also keep the electrol college so congress helps our nation to vote also. Because if we give this country over to the wrong president our country could fall and we could go under. One of the reasons that our country is still standing today is because we as a nation have pick a great president, without hessition. Back in the old days we didnt have a right to vote. We are blessed to be able to vote and a system like the electrol college today. If we lose the electrol college we lose hope and faith that our country we be still standing.

In conclusion,

We americans are sometimes not greatful for the things we have but without we are lost. Senator we need your help. Without the electrol citizen we lose hope on our country. Please let us down.    ",2
869ffcc,"Dear senator,

I belive that we shouldn't keep the Electoral College. The election by popular vote is more fair for electing a president.

First off, going with election by popular vote is more fair. For example, in the article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" the author states, "" Obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So,other things be equal, a large states gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" Its not fair that small towns/states gets less attention for the president because their opinion and votes dont really matter if they get less attention. Another reason for my argument is, ""Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in Califonia. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attentionto the campaign than they would have if the president we picked by popular vote.."" Proving that not many people have a say when voting.

In addition, the election by popular vote seems more better. For example, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but or a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Why is it that we arent actually voting for a president? That other people are technically voting for us. If we were to vote by popular vote people would actually feel like they are voting for who they want in office.""Consider that state legislatres are technically responsible for picking electors and that those people could always defy the will of the people."" So much time goes into election day but for what? We just vote for how we feel but not for who we vote for.

To conclude, people should feel like they have a say when voting. The Electoral College does not seem fair to others. Election by popular vote is way better and is more fair.                     ",3

It was about 2 miles long in a region called Cydonia. The unusual shadows of the ""face"" made it look almost to be an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The scientists just figured it was another Martian mesa which were common to the region, but the caption took notes of a ""huge rock formation, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Nasa decided to take a closer look.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture 10 times sharper than the original photo. It turns out it was just a natural landform. Not everyone was happy though, they say it was too cloudy to see if there were any alien markings.

Once again on April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took another picture on a cloudless summer day. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" The picture was so close that if there were anything on the ground we would've been able to see them. The picture shows the Martian is equivalent of a butte or mesa.

Although it seems near impossible, the author leads one to believe that exploring Venus' surface may be more possible than it looks at first glance. There are metals that could survive such conditions.

While floating 30 or so miles above the surface of the fireball-like planet might give us more insight than we already have, to really acquire significant information, we need to get right down on the ground. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. While that may be hot enough to melt a chinsy-built little robot, the author makes a valid point that a system of steel gears and levers would be able to withstand such conditions for a long period of time. If we could send a mechanical-built robot down to explore, it might be able to survive on the surface of Venus long enough to collect some of the information we need. Perhaps a machine made out of tungsten, it'd be heavy, but the melting point would be significantly higher.

In conclusion, the author makes many valid points that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that come with the exploration of the planet. Harder metals with hotter melting points are obviously going to last longer. Even floating 30 or so miles above the surface in a space ship could potentially give us more information than we already have. If we have the resources to make landing and exploring our sister planet possible, why not get all the way on the ground and get as much information as possible though?",3

According to the article it's considered as the Earth's twin because ""it is the closest in Earth in terms of density and size, and accasionally the closest in distance too."" All planets obit the sun at different speeds. Earth is sometimes closer to Mars and somethimes closer to Venus.

The diffuclt planet that it is a challenge for humans to explore is the planet Venus because the temperature is nearly 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Humans can not stand high temperatures rather than 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Humans have had planned missions to visit Venus but not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus for more than three decades. The conditions in Venus are extrememly worst than what humans have encouter on the planet Earth.

2b63205,"Transportation is a large necessity in most countries worldwide. With no doubt, cars, buses, and other means of transportation make going from place to place easier and faster. However there's always a negative; pollution. Although mobile transportations are a huge part of daily lives, we are endangering the Earth with harmfull greenhouse gases, which could be suppressed.

A small suburb community in Germany called Vauban, has started a ""car-free"" lifestyle. In this city, markets and stores are placed nearby homes, instead of being located by far-end highways. Although Vauban is not completely car-free, 70% of Vauban families do not own cars; Even a large 57% of families stated to have sold their cars to move to Vauban. Some families have even said to be less stressed depending on car transportation. Cars are responsible for about 12% of greenhouse gases, and can even be up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Another insight to reduced car zones brings Paris' incident with smog. Paris' officials created a system that would in fact lower smog rates. On Monday, the motorists with even-numbered license plates numbers would be ordered to leave their cars at home, or they would suffer a fine. Same rule would occur on Tuesday, except motorists with odd-numbered license plates were targeted with fines. Congestion, or traffic, was reduced by 60% after five days of intense smog. Diesel fuel played a huge part in this pollution, having the fact that 67% of vehicles in France are of Diesel fuel. The impact of the clearing of smog, resided in banning the Tuesday rule of odd license plates.

Could you imagine a day without seeing a single car being used? This phenomenon occurs once a year in Bogota, Colombia. With the exception of buses and taxis being used, cars are to be left unattended for an entire day. Having a car-free day just once a year can even reduce the pollution slightly. The day without cars is part of a campaign that originated in Bogota in the mid 1990s. This campaign has renewed and constructed numerous bicycle paths and sidewalks all over the city. Parks and sports centers have also sprung from this campaign. Devoting your time to a car-free lifestyle has it's hassles, but in hindsight, it has it's benefits.

To conclude, living a car-free lifestyle does not seem like a possibility in this day and age, however managing the use of cars and pollution is something every country should take time investing in. Think about how much of an impact it would be if everywhere world-wide would take part in air-pollution reduction. Mobile transportation is lifestyle in a sense, and being dependent on cars or other means of transportation can impact the health of the Earth and even ourselves.                                                     ",4
8c0e66a,"Cars. Everyone has cars. On the street, in their driveways, in parking lots. You think everyone uses car. Well your wrong. Not everyone has cars or uses cars for that matter.

In Vauban, Germany residents given up their cars to walk the streets. Where we generally park in like parking lots, parking garages, street parking, home driveways, and home garages are all forbidden. In Vauban their streets are completely car-free. They do allowed cars there but some people just want to walk to safe their community. But if you have are car you can only park in two places. Those two places are your house, and large garages at the edge of the development. I would never give up my car to live in Vauban, Germany. In matter of fact 57% of people have sold their cars to live there. To believe or not 70% of Vaubans families do not own cars. To me its hard to think that people actually walk everywhere they go.

Paris bans driving to clean the air of the global city because of pollution. Due to the ban of driving people who are caught driving will be fined 22-euro which is $31 in america. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Its hard to believe that diesels make up 67% of France, compared to 53.3% of average diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. The smog cleared enough that French part rescind to ban odd numbered plates on Tuesday.

Today Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. This thing has left people like researchers woundering a fundamental question "" Has America pass peak driving?"" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was neraly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

Its carzy how some countries have no cars allowed policy. Some countries baned cars, dont allow them on the streets. People would go carzy if they didnt have their cars and had to walk everywhere they want to go.    ",1
d94f7e5,"The author did well on supporting the idea that studying Venus

is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers becasue there might be some new stuff that we havn't yet explored on Venus.

In the article it mentioned that Venus has still has some features that are similar to Earth, like valleys, mountains, and craters. "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" ( paragraph 4) "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.""( paragraph 4) The artical also mentioned that

Venus might acturally be a planet that us humans or other types of life forms could possibly be able to live on Venus because the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on earth. "" Temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" ( paragraph 5).

Scientist belives that long ago, Venus could have possibly contained oceans, which could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth does. Scientists are problably questioning on what happend to Venus oceans.

I know that if us humans were to go Venus without a spacesuit, we would problably get crushed becuse of the air pressure, just like the water pressure could crush a submarine, depending on how deep down you go into the oceans. If Venus had Earth-like features wouldn't that me that Venus once had air that us humans could breath, water that we could actually drink, etc. In the articel talked about how Venus

didn't have different kinds of light because the light couldn't penetrate through the dence asmosphere. Us humans and other types of life forms need sunlight to survive, So how could life possibly be found on Venus if there is hardly any type of

light coming through. The mystery behind Venus, has yet to be unsolved, but I feel like some day we will get to bottom of this mystery and when we do get to the bottom of this mystery, the mystery will be solved and all of our questions will be answered. Im hoping that some day we do solve this mystery. Venus could actually be another planet that us humans and other types of life form could live on, but until we solve this mystery, we're going to have to keep trying, don't give up, keep gathering new type of information and when we do gather some new information, we keeping closer and closer to solving this mystery. So lets just keep pushing forward and hopefully reach this goal. So lets just keep our heads up high and just hope for the best. If we all work together, we might actually solve this mystery. ",4
75ef893,"Have you ever took a vacation into a large city to see someone you know, or live in one yourself? Well if you didn't already notice, every single day wether the weather is nice or stormy, there's always this layering dark gray haze in the sky of pollution combined with the sound and congestion of cars going to tons of different destinations. That right there would be a car polluted city, which has a smog problem because of the over use of auto mobiles which is extremely harmful to the environment and us as human beings. You're probably thinking ""How do I stop using my car?"" but the goal isn't to stop using auto mobiles, but maybe to....reduce it.

One very big impact you can make is to ""car pool"" which you probably already do but maybe try if you try making it an every morning habit, like for example: You and your aquaintances go to the same destination for work, and you happen to live within a couple miles of them, if you have time you could pick them up and drop them off which would not only be much better for the environment, you would also be de-congesting traffic by keeping three or more cars off the road. Now imagine if everyone did it? The roads would be calm and empty, making transportation much faster or easier and create huge positive impact on the environment by reducing all those green house gases.

Is the job or place you're heading too, four or less miles away, and you can't pay for that ridiculously priced gallon or two of gas every morning to start your car and you don't have any friends near by to ""car pool""? The answer is simple and actually might get you there faster plus save you lots of money, it's biking there. Now you probably are thinking ""That's completely undesirable to have to do that every day to go somewhere local"". Here is why it's actually a huge advantage over driving that short distance, 1. You'll end up with more money at the end of the week by not buying gas, 2. You will get fit much faster because biking will burn calories just like running or working out would and 3. You can completely avoid congestion which definitely makes your life less stressful because trust me, no one wants to be late for something so close to them just because of car traffic.

To conclude this, it's really ultimately your decison and if you would like to make a extraordinary positive impact on the environment, make your life easier or less stressful, then I'd do it, and maybe along the way you might become better friends with people you know by car pooling with them or become more fit and healthy by making biking just as routine as your car used to be every day for those short distance trips.            ",3
9ecd3e3,"Do you want to live and see your family another day? If you say yes to this then help us take a stand against these driverless cars. These cars can not guarentee your safety with just a few cameras and sensors. These cars also basically do not do much to help if we're the ones that have to, park, pull out of spaces, navigating through work zones, and around accidents. Your life is more important than relaxing while a car drives for you and can most likely wreck and cause death to you and many others.

First, Driverless cars can not save your life with some cameras, a GPS system, sensors, and a inertial motion sensor. A lot of people might be thinking that this is a good idea, an idea to let a computer drive for you but no one is thinking about what could happen if something malfunctions on the car and you wreck and get injured or possibly death. Also there might be a possibility that the Dubbed LIDAR (camera that uses laser beams to create 3d models of the car's surroundings) gets broken by hail, a storm, or even someone breaks it off. These cars never said anything about how this car can guarentee the driver's safety. That should give everyone the general idea that they might not really know what could happen to you but they don't want you to know.

Next, These ""Driverless Cars"" aren't doing much driving for you if you have to be the one to do some of the most simplest things that even the computer can't do. Your the one basically doing most of the driving since they need you to park, pull out of spaces, navigating through work zones, and to go around accidents. Does that seem like you should even spend way more money because of how much they put into it, for no reason? They should've made more extensions to the vehicle if all it does is steer, accelerate, and brakes themselves. These cars they are trying to put out there on the market when they only do 3 small things for you and could still possibly malfunction and cause the deaths of innocent lives.

Finally, You shouldn't be letting a computer drive for you. Your life is way more important than relaxing for a few minutes and for you to most likely wreck and kill innocent civilians. These cars can possibly danger the lives of families. There is no point in buying a car that could kill your family or a loved one just for you to relax for that short amount of time to get to your destination. These cars already didn't say anything about guarenteeing your safety let alone trust your life with a copmuter.

In Conclusion, Your lives matter to the world more than a smarter car to save you a few minutes of relaxing. Don't be the one that takes your hands off the wheel and could possibly kill the people you love. The people you care about in that car could be dead in seconds if you let a computer take over your car for that small amount of time. Rise up today and take a stand against the people that are building cars to kill innocent people or even the ones you love dearly. ",4
7414f02,"People all through out the world are realizing the problem we are having with emissions and smog problems. If we dont act soon enough we could lose our lives, maybe even our home(the world). Be like germany and some of the other parts of the world that are taking action to the smog and emission problems.

Limting car usage can have a positive affect on the world. Instead of hearing the sounds of motors constantly running, we can hear the sounds of active kids and bicycles. Over the past few decades, germany and in other places in the world are trying out the idea of limiting the amount of cars that are allowed in areas. In upscale areas in germany such as the district on the outskirts of Freiburg, the streets are ""car-free"" except the main throughfare where the tram for downtown runs. One way they enforce this is that to live in these area, you can either buy a parking space for $40,000 along with a home. 70% of the families that live in these areas dont have a car because of this. Transportation may be lower, but with the use of parking spots and garages eliminated, everything can be in walking distance rather than in a mall miles away.

As the greenhouse affect continues to grow, cities with major car emmission will literally be choking themselves to death. France had a very serious case involving the smog so in order to clear the smog, they enforces a partial driving ban to clear the air. ""On Monday motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The sane would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" close to 4,000 drivers were fined. the smog cleared enough on monday the ban was lifted on tuesday for the odd-numbered plates. as the smog cleared up enough for this to be possible.

In the past few years Obama has said that the car usuage has dropped for the passed few years steadilly since our peak in 2005. Since then scientist and observationalist has seen that people between 16 and 39 haven't got there liscence as much as before. Scientists don't know if this is a last affect or will it go back up one the people have kids. There have been offered different alternatives to lower emissions, improve safety, conserve resources, and to save time. Only time will tell what happens.

If people were smart enough to just learn to ride a bike or walk to work in the mornings and afternoons, we wouldnt have this problem. we wouldnt have to be so worried about our atmosphere if less people were to drive in a car, and more started doing something less expensive and less harmful to the enviorment. not everybody will listen but if the majority of the people listened to this, we could all breathe fresh air and not be so unhappy with all the conjested roads.

a1cd4ce,"Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different deisgns, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common - they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutants given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollutions so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutant emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tend to become more relaxed and happy.

The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive everyday, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutants coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, ""...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves.

The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want wihtout rushing becaus the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With less cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway (Source 1). With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things.

When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Plaza states in the article ""Car-fre day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Heirdrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, (Rosenthal)"" When Heirdrum means ""this way"", she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them.

Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some down fall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom; uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks; rush-hour will be cut traffic; and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed ""parternering with the telecommunications inductry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transprtation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety'"" (Source 4). In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment.    ",6

According to the aritcle "" A think atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" thoses number are not good for man. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any of the planets in our soler system. Atmospheric pessure for venus is 90 time greater then what we experience on our own plant.

Throughout the text the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy mission but also he knows the cons . Visiting Venus may seem as an easy thing to accomplish since the planet it so close to Earth but actually exploring it is a very difficult task. Theres many obstucles and harsh conditions towards humans to visisting Venus but many are so facinated by it because it is very earth like.

Firstly , Venus is a part of our solar system . In paragragh two it stays ""venus is often referred to as Earths ""twin"" , as in terms of the same density and size."" That quote explains how the planets are very similar to one another. Many years from now if we discover more and more things about the planet and know that its safe , austronauts could possibly send people to stay there .

In addition , in paragrapgh four it states ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various life forms like Earth today."" Many wonder how has the planet has changed, why did it change and if it could form back to what it was.

Finally , there are many cons throught the expirement of visiting Venus. Throught the text it talks about how different it is from Earth as well and how it could possibly harm any living thing . As in paragrapgh three it quotes ""Thick atmosphere of almost nighty-seven percent , the planets surface tempatures average over eight hundred degrees and the preasure is nighty percent higher than earth"" . No human is meant to survive throught those conditions . A submarine cant even handle the deep parts on the planet , our human flesh would just burn and melt with very high tempatures , and with all the preassue humans would just explode .

In conclusion , if austronauts are capable of finding out safe things for humans to travel to venus then they could possibly survive . Austronauts should push through the challenges so we could value it . Also , humans are very curious of how it could lead to anything so they shall expand their investigation . ",3

The Electoral Eollege seems highly unfair to the people. The winner, may not even be the majority vote. Perhaps a president received a majority of the votes, but the people then have to rely on electors to vote for them. That vote may not be what the people really wanted.

When it is time for elections, small states have a disadvantage on having a big part in the president's election. A president may win over five smaller states, and yet the other could win over California and still have more electoral votes. Larger states get more attention than smaller states. This is unfair. Some voters feel trapped because they know their vote won't effect the state ruling. Voters lose incentive.

Voters in presidential elections tend to want to be heard and feel as if their vote matters so they can express their political preferences. With electoral college votes, they feel the vote is unfair and they are relying on a few people and hoping they vote for the voters candidate. The people feel as if it's kind of like gmabling. In swing states, people have an advantage there. The ""winner-take-all"" method induces the candidates to pay more attention to those states. The candidates will campaign there more often and gain more and more attention from the swing state voters. Other states do not like this because they get less attention and the votes in swing states are more thoughtful than one-sided states.

The Electoral College votes, seem not-so-democtratic. It is the electors who actually end up electing the president...not the people. Anyways, this            ",3

Students would probably be going through some tough times in their life, and they need some help but they are to scared to say it to an adult. The teacher might no be interesting to them. Teachers want to know on how to get all the students attention in class and do their work. This technology will be useful for teachers to be more interesting, seeing what makes the students happy, and helping a problem in their life that needs to be fix.

Let's say Alex is a student and is having a hard time at home because of their parents arguing every single time, being scared that they might one day not be together. The Facial Action Coding System will help an adult figure out what's making his emotion change and becoming sad. It will get an adult attention to talk to his parents and fix thing out.

In conclusion The Facial Action Coding System is useful to reading the emotional expression of students, or photos of someone that lived long ago and figuring out how they lived, and seeing what emotions they were having in the old days.

c6c9bf9,"The invention of the automobile was one of the most important inventions of all time. Everyone uses cars! They're everywhere! But what are the effects of car emissions? Are they even worth using if they cause negative effects on people and our environment? Many people are trying to cut back on driving, or even live without cars. Why are they doing this? Well, let me inform you about some of the advanrtages of limited car usage throughout the world.

In Vauban, Germany, there is a suburb where people have decided to ban cars all together. The neighborhood roads are completely car-free and even having a garage is usually not allowed. About 5500 people live in this suburb and 70% of these people do not own cars. For the other 30%, there is a parking garage that is located on the edge of the community that requires a $40,000 payment to use. This trend is growing immensely in Europe and there could quite possibly be several communites that would mirror Vauban and what it is all about. This effort to ban cars is based on the idea of reducing pollution as well as reducing stress, and many members of the community insist they live happier and less stressful lives since moving into Vauban.

Bogota, Columbia is the home to nearly 7 million people, and in Bogota there is an annual car-free day, with hopes to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. There is also hope that this idea will spread to other cities and to other countries around the world. For the people who decide not to participate in the annual car-free day, a fine of $25 would be handed out. This ""holiday"" if you will, could be revolutionary potentially and if implemented year round, could really put a dent in the ammount of pollution throughout the city. Even the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay revered the program, saying it is ""generating a revolutionary change"".

Officials in Paris, France put a partial driving ban on the city in an effort to reduce smog in the city. The ban worked like this, on Monday, drivers with even-numbered license plates would not be allowed on the road. The next day, it would be the drivers eith odd-numbered license plates that would have to leave their cars at home. Nearly 4000 people were fined due to the enforcement of this ban, for somewhere around $120,000 total. The strictness of the ban was due to the seriousness of the smog and the fact that it was intensifying. The dissapearance of the smog resulted in loosening of the ban and less negative feedback from drivers.

As you can see, these places have been limiting car usage and found at least some sort of benefit from doing so. Maybe if these restrictions or all together bans were implemented in more places, pollution in the world would be hindered.            ",3
843f86a,"How often do you ride in a car? Do you drive a one or any other motor vehicle to work? The store? To the mall? Have you ever thought about how many people in the world do that exact same thing- travel to every destination using a fuel powered motorvehicle. Not many people realize the intenisve damage that they're doing when they turn their key in the egnition. What if you didn't drive to work today? If you're like any regular car user, the thought ""What?! I could never survive without my car!"" may run through your mind. It is possible though, to live without your main mean of transport. Just look at cities like Vuban, Paris, and Bogota; each one has in some way restricted their people's usage of cars and they actually enjoy it! If you limit your car usage, it can inturn result in many advantages and benefits in yourself and in your community.

A not so recognized benefit to giving up your car usge would be the positive consequences it has on your health. In source 1, Heidrun Walter states that ""When [he] had a car, [he] was always tense. [He's] much happier [without it]."" Think about it, imagine all the angry road rage you experience while driving. That surely does not have a positive effect on your mood or health. Driving takes a copious amount of focus and mental activity, such as, trying to navigate, dealing with bad drivers, etc., that after a short period of time, you're stressed out and tired. In cities like New York and Paris, the population is high. This leads to congestion in the streets and excessive amounts of pollution. Warm layers of air, according to Robert Duffer in ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" traps the car emissions. How is that healthy? He also states that Paris had to enforce a temporary driving ban after the pollution levels reached an all time record. After a few days of less driving the pollution went way down. Since people aren't driving, they have to find other means of transport. This could include walking, biking, or skating to destintions. Those are all physical excercises! Your body is getting to work out and you'll mentally feel fresher; more than you would sitting in a car.

Taking a break from driving also can help with the overall look of your city. Pollution doesn't cause the flowers to grow. It certainly doesn't smell nice. It sets a filter over the town and gives off a ""dirty"" vibe. With less driving, there is less nasty pollution being emitted, therefore leading to a cleaner community. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, ""In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars,"" she gives the good point that since there is a restriction on car and motor vehicle transportation, there is going to be more walkers. If you have tons of people taking the sidewalks instead of the roads, you might need a few more pathways and closer stores that are in walking distance. Andrew Selsky states that ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks... and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

As stated previously, pollution is not benefiting the environment. Organizations such as the Envronmental Protection Agency in the U.S., are promoting ""car reduced"" communities, says Rosenthal. These communities have far less pollution and are much cleaner. Cities are also promoting this idea and are having days devoted to ""no-car driving."" In Bogota, Colombia, they hold an anual ""car-free"" day where only buses and taxis are permitted. Any other drivers would be fined. Although fining someone for using a posession they own might ruffle some feathers, it did have a successful turn out and significantly reduced the ""smog.""

In conclusion, although the idea of giving up our precious automobiles for walking to our destination might sound impossible, it's not. Reducing our driving can lead to many benefits and advantages in our daily lives. These include an increase in health, an improved look to our cities, and an improved environment all around us. So, instead of picking up the car keys next time you have to go to work, try dusting off the helmet and take a bike ride!    ",5
35fd114,"The new techonology tht is called Facial Action Coding System is beinng use to identify human emotions. If this were to be used in a classroom some kids might not want to be scanned and have there emotions known. So I honestly think that this machine or new piece of techonology should not be used in classrooms and heres why.

To start it off I can already tell that some kids will not want there emotions to be known. That's something that the kid is able to keep a secret. If the kids doesn't want there emotions to be known then he or she has the right to not let them be known. Now in paragraph 6 a quote from Dr. Huang ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Now although it is true that some kids may need help for the work that there doing. They may not understand it and that's where the computer comes in. But the teacher can't just scan the kids face and have the computer do all the work. The teacher has to also know when a kid is having troube with the material. Obviously it's almost impossible to know how every student is doing but if you see a kid getting bad grades on the material then the teacher should help the student out. That goes back to if the student actually wants to be scanned to identify his or her emotions.

A quote from Dr. Huang "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression."" That's is also another thing that I want to talk about. The teacher really has to care for his or her students. It's the teachers job to make sure that a kid is doing good in school. I do understand that there are some kids that just don't even try. Those kids are difficult to make them succeed. But for the other students the teacher has to know if he or she is having a bad day. You could ask whats wrong and if the student doesn't want to tell you then they don't have to. But the teachers have to make sure that the student knows that the teacher is there to help. Now although some kids hide there expressions really well I guess that's

when you would want the maching to scan there face. But as I keep saying only if they want to. The teacher might have a problem on knowing how a kid feels and knowing there emotion. But if the student doesn't want there emotion to be known thats what the kid wants. In many ways we don't need a maching to help with human proteries. Thats why humans talk to humans anout there emotions not humans talk to machines.

I hope that this new techonology is going towards high schools. In this day and age so many high schcoolers are going through alot. It doen't take a rocket scientist to know how a student feels when it's finals week. There are situations where the teacher doesn't need to know how a student is feeling. The only time where a student needs to be scanned is when that student is having trouble on a material and if the student actually wants to be scanned by the Facial Acton Coding System. I want to talk about this quote from paragraph 6 from Dr. Huang ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The fact that a computer needs to explain the work to a student is just wrong and dumb. That is why a teacher is in the classroom. That's why the teacher went to college to get her degree and work with students. We all know that there are bad teachers in this world. The teachers where all they do is give you a packet and ask for it finished tomorrow. The teachers where they do a horible job at explaining the material. Then and only then will I be good with having the Facial Action Coding System scan the kids faces. Thats is when the computer will help out the students and teach them the material that the teacher can't do. That is the only time I think that is okay to use.

So there are

my thoughts on why this should not be able to scan the kids faces when in a classroom. I honestly feel that the kid has the right if they want to be scanned even if the kid is having trouble in the class and if the kids emotions are easy to be seen that's is when a teacher comes and helps.So no this should not be in classrooms. But I do think that it could be used in other better ways. Like in a police forece where they scan the person who did the crime to get information. But not in a classroom. ",4
fd2de62,"Althought many peope believe that venus is far away from earth, venus is the second planet to earth. When reading the passage you come across to the word ""misleading"" you start to wonder if the words provided to us is a word that no one knows.

In the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" he used personal experience to inform the readers that venus is a planet and not a star. In the article paragraph 5 it talkes about how what space administrations are trying to figure out how to test venus and what the whole story about it is. In the article it is said that if people haven't seen it, its because ""numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study. despite its proximity to us"". When ready this, its telling us that its not only a challenge but its not possible for somone to land on venus and research what it is that we cant touch ground.

In the article ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" although many beleive that venus will never be know and seen, venus is the second planet. For that reason building and advancing technology is the best way to see why humans cant go to venus and what is causing all the hottness. Although venus may have so many negative effects with beign to hot and to far to not have the technology needed. At the same time venus has some positive things aswell like""striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". With this being said not only is valuable but its giving humans timtation to the point at one point things will change over time and venus will been explored.

Overall venus is one of the planets most known not becaues humans have exploreded but because its the planet most wanted, in which humans cant really see or be in. throughtout years technology will continue to advance and expirements continue to evolve.",3
8de1ffb,"Do you smell that? Its the smell of gasoline and exaust fumes. Cars are taking over suburban areas. Spewing out polution and contaminating the air. There are solutions, and cities across the world are trying them.

One city that has impacted many is the city of Vauban in Germany, this city has car free streets. They were able to acomplish this by making stores and buisnesses walking distance. Apariently people are happier without cars, Heidrun Walter (citizen of Vauban) while she was walking the streets of Vauban said,"" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way."". Furthermore having car free streets is also benificial to the fitness of the citizens. Without a car you are forced to walk or ride a bike which is a form of exercise.

Vehicles are terrible for cities. Cars spew exaust fumes that rise into the air and polute the cities. In Paris they almost hit record high polution levels. Cars were banned untill the polution level went down, smog covered the cities. The polution got trapped in the layers of the smog. The smpog levels rivaled Beijing, which is the most poluted city in the world. The only way to cut down on polution is to stop using cars, or switch to hybrids and plug in cars.

Some cities are taking it days at a time. In the city Bogata, Columbia there is a day where no one is alowed to drive. In Bogata they have this one day where no one is alowed to drive, they have this day to cut down polution levels and clear the streets. Other cities have started doing the same thing. This day is very benificial to the cities It helps decrease polution and smog levels and traffic jams. More people are riding bikes, going to parks and since more people are walking they have made broad, smooth sidewalks.

These movements are changing cities and making them healthier. Soon there will be less cars clean air and happier cities. So, are you ready to change.                             ",3
7228e60,"When people hear the title ""Unmasking the face on Mars"" they think look their is a face or structure on mars that the aliens built. But what it's really soposed to be is or equivalent to is a butte or mesa. So if you think that for a split second think agian cause your wrong.

To start of this discusion of the so called ""face"" on mars I would like to tell you is that it is not at all a face. What it is just a landform that has formed to look so simular to a face or moument of the martians. But mars is like earth it forms things just like it so what it really is is just a couple of rocks and thier shadows to form a face like thing.

On the other hand is how do we know this. Well ever since the discovery scientist have been researching and taking more pictures and looking at it a whole lot closer. What we came up with is that like I said before a landform on mars but some say where wrong.

Another reason that bothers me is how people think its a conspiracy theory. many, many, many people think ""oh its just nothing but the martians"" but no this is just a mesa but since people say that stuff we had to prove them wrong. So what NASA did was they built a big camera to take pictures of it to prove it was a big rock which it was a huge budget problem for them but they still did it.

People may argue by saying so if it is something simular to earth then that means martians were here to and then they got bord of the place they so they left and went somewhere else. then they built this big face of maybe a king or emporer or something and they are hiding from us. But there not its just a rock. what I am trying to say is that the ""face"" is just a mesa and nothing else but a mesa so if someone says its a face just say its a mesa. ",3
6895712,"Presidential election is held every after four years on the first Monday of the month November. We decide who's going to be our next leader, the President. Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and she/he got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be a disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College.

Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College has a total of 538 electoras and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you atleast have to have 270 electoral votes and this is a good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President.

Remember the election between Obama and Romney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romeny. Almost of every states electoral votes is on a ""winner-take-all"" basis. For every slight of pulrality in each of the states, it creates a ""landslide electoral-vote"". This means that a tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College.

Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive a majority of the votes. In passage three it gave an example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in pluraity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to lead us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election.

If we elect our President using popular votes it migh be a disaster. Because not all of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If he/she got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in a huge chaos. I slightly agree with electing that person and making him/her the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader.

7e56af4,"The Face on mars has to be a natural landform. My reasons for believing that is because there is no proof of aliens on Mars, there is no possible way that a human built because the only thing that has gotten to Mars is a bunch of probes, and even if we did have a human on Mars we wouldn't have the equipment to build something like that. There are no signs of alien life so how can it be made by aliens ?

The face on Mars is a natural landform. In the article it says JPL web site said that it was a natural landform. That means there is no possible chance that it was built by aliens. I think the reason why the radio, Hollywood, magazines, and TV said all that stuff was so that they could attention. People in the world for some reason are drawn to all that. They are drawn to the idea that there is a possible chance that we aren't the only ones out here in universe. The people that did all of that most likey just wanted attention, so that can they get more views or followers.

An ancient civilization on Mars just wouldn't make any sense. We had ancient civilizations too, but we didn't bulid every single butte in America. Natural landforms are so interesting that people just immediately think who made it and how it got there. There is no possible way that an ancient group of anything made that because there is not enough advanced technology. Even if aliens did exist and they did have technology why would they waste there time on building a face on Mars ?

If you are saying that it's not natural then thats like saying that the Middle Butte and Snake River where made by aliens. Just think for actual second about how that makes no sense because I don't go outside and see aliens trying to build a landform. Even if aliens did make it then how come they aren't still around or left any clues behind? Did they just all of the sudden build an amazing landform and just leave? No they didn't because if you put your hard work into something you are going to stay with it as long as you can and see how it ends up later in life. If there was aliens they would've left something so that we would know it was them.

The Face on Mars was not made by aliens. It says in the article that it is a natural landform. I don't believe everything that scientist say but I believe this one because it makes sense. All the proof you need is in the article and I added some things such as, how we can't find any aliens, how there are no signs of them now or even in the past, and that if they are real they wouldn't have that type of technology.

c2c2fff,"The brightest point in the night sky, otherwise know as the planet Venus, is a very difficult place to discover. In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author talks about the dangers that exploring Venus brings along with it. The author supports this idea well by sharing the pros and cons of going there.

Although there are many risks, it could help scientists better understand how common Venus and Earth are. The author states that Venus' ""temperatures average over 800 degree Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are very extreme for any human because we aren't exposed to that type of heat and pressure at any discovered place on Earth. However, in the fourth paragraph, he says that Venus might have been ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" and that it ""still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Although these reasons are good for scientific purposes, the risk poses a huge threat for the way that NASA chooses to explore Venus.

The author supports this idea of exploring Venus very well by giving both pros and cons for exploration. They give facts about the climate there while also giving examples of how to avoid these dangers. He knows that Venus has value so the shouldn't stop them from finding out more from this cloud-draped world. ",2
178f445,"In the 21st century there has

been a lot of new technology invented. Driverless cars is among the many invention ideas that is still on the drawing board. Driverless cars should not be developed because it will cost a lot of money, traffic laws will have to be modified, and the cars won't be truely driverless.

The amount of money it will cost to make a mass oroduction of driverless cars is not worth it. The passage says ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sennsors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor."" All of the items that the Toyota Prius has on it will be needed for the new driverless cars. The things mentioned in the quote do not include the many internal modifications that will need to be made. The car companies that create cars will need to pay to have thier workers trained to be able to do the modificatins that the driverless car needs. The car company will also have to pay for all of the expensive sensors that are needed. This wil drive up the over all cost of the smart car, and make it too expensive for the average working person.

The driving laws that exist as of today focus on keeping all citizens safe, and lawmakers assume that the onlt safe cars have an alert human driver. The passage says ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safecar has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars."" In the US the laws state that it is illegal in many states . The laws in those states would have to be changed to allow driverless cars to enter into that state. The traffic laws that those states have were created to try and keep all members of society safe. The assumption of the states with these laws are that the only safe car is a car being driven by an alert human. Sincethis is that case the laws that were created most likely would not be changed to allow driverless cars to drive on the roads of those states.

The cars would not be able to be completly driverless. The passage says ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The cars that have been invented and tested so far are unable to be completly driverless. The cars lack skills that only humans are able to accomplish. These skills include navigating through work zones and accidents, which are two very common things on today's roads.

Since the cars are not completly driverless a human driver will have to be alert at all times in case the car isn't able to preform a human driving skill that is needed.

The overall cost, law changes, and driving assistance that will be needed to operate a driverless car is not worth it. Those factors will not change in a few years, so car companies should not waste their time and resources trying to develop a driverless vehical.    ",5
625e070,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author proposes the idea that driverless cars are things in the future that are closer than one could possibly imagine. Despite the good qualities of the car, it is not as useful as one may think.

The car in itself is expensive. There are many changes that will need to be made in present laws and roads in order for the car to work at its best. The car is also not safe, due to the fact that the driver is not as engaged and more vulnerable to distractions. Most importantly, the car is just simply unecessary.

Some may argue that the car is efficient and that due to less use of fuel it may even be better for the enviornment, but if it truly is about helping the earth, would it not be more efficient to place the money directly into fixing the earth? Another possible arguement is the fact that due to a less engaging driving session, many more people would be able to drive comfortably. However, the passage clearly states that the car will still monitor that the driver is just as engaged, supporting the statement that they are unecessaery.

A better proposal would be the alerts the driverless cars offer but in a regular car. That way alternate safety precautions are available to the average person. Many accidents are caused by people sleeping at the wheel and a car making sure the driver is engaged might help lessen that.

In conclusion, although the idea of a driverless car sounds fantastic, it just maybe have to wait. However, many concepts that will be applied to the futuristic car may really help out if applied to regular cars.",3
998557d,"Started with the founding fathers. The Electoral College was founded and swung into the constitution, as a compromise between Congress and the President with a popular and electoral vote. Now that time has evolved and the world has changed. The Electoral College is not in the favor of everyones expectations, it seems like it favors one side more than it favors others. The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing the president, it is also known as a non-democratic method of having one side favored, and it can cause catastrophe.

Intially, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing presidents. The Electoral College has been around for centuries, but now people feel as if the way presidents are being chose to run our country is unfair. The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, ""Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" The candidates in the ""lame"" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are ""the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election."" Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized.

Also, the Electoral College can be known as a non-democratic method. When something is non-democratic, it means that it is not in the democrats favor. It is a rap for them, its already set for the Republicans to win. Stated in the passage, ""In a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" Democrats may cast in their vote for presidential candiate comes with a group of electors, they see the electoral college as favorable towards the Republican group.

Next, the Electoral College should be changed, because it causes catastrophe. When voting for president, it puts the electors in charge. ""Electors can be anyone not holding public office."" One may never know how much the elector is trustworthy, and responsible. Some may not even feel comfortable with leaving the electors in charge of such cases. People feel uneasy, because they do not know what happens behind close doors, they are never certain on who's hands can change things for the benefit of themselves. The citizens and the people may not be comforatbe with such things.

But, as much as the Electoral College may not seem beneficial and fair to some it can be a good thing also. Stated in the passage ""Election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where delegations vote on the president."" Us people, us as citizens would not even be in charge or have a say so in who runs our country. We would not even have a choice or chance to vote and see who is worthy and most honorable in our eyes to be our president. Some may be lucky on the Representative choices on who the Electors and our Presidents would be, but also some may be dissatisified. The favor will only be in the representaives place. And the odds will be onto us. The Electoral College is not ran by the Representatives. We have a say so.

Finally, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing the president, it is also known as a non-democratic method of having one side favored, and it can cause catastrophe. The Electoral College shows a wide range of it either being a good or a bad way on voting.                ",3

What does this program do, you might ask? Well we're here to tell you just what it is, and why you should join it!

We're part of the ""United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaion Administration,"" or in shorter terms, the UNRRA.

We have worked together to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. All together we are 44 nations. But helping others isn't the only benefit, you get to see sights you've never seen before.

Everyone has the benefit of seeing atleast one country. Last year, our group had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. They also got to ride the gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Our group also got to see an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on their way to China.

There isn't only helping people and seeing sites, you actually get to travel the high seas. However, this might be the hardest part. The groups were always busy and it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. The part that had to be the most challenging for some members were caring for the animals during the crossings.

There are also fun times on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Usually we play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals are housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure for some people. For most of our groups, it opened up the world to them. They stated that they were ""grateful for the opporunity, and that it made them more aware of people of ther countries and their needs.""

In conclusion, that is why you should join our Seagoing Cowboys program. Thank you for listening, and we hope to see you in the future!",4

By doing that, it allows voters to have a fair vote. There would not a ""winner-take-all"" system anymore, but above all the candidates can have a fair fight against each other without the interfrence of the representatives.

Well to start it off, why would having the popular vote be better than the electoral college? That's because the electoral college is unfair to voters.

""The single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, and the 55 representatives from california represent 35 million voters.(infor find on  paragraph 12)"" By given that many votes for just one representative, is it fair for the candidates? Not only that, but what about the 55 representative from california, what if all those 55 representative voted for their candidate from california? You know without thinking, of course the candidate from california would win. Would it be fair for the candidates and the other voters?

Although if you think about it, electoral vote can help in cerent ways. Like what if there is not many voters that voted? Or being in a tie, but of course that wouldn't happens, and like i said earlier it would'nt be fair to some of the candidates and voters who tried hard to elect or be elected. Like i said before please change the system of electing president by popular votes instead of electoral college!    ",3
de8ad8a,"Dear, State Senator

I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. What is the point of voting if the Electoral College decides who wins? Using popular vote means the citizens would actually decide on who would win. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. Who picks the electors in the first place? The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state.

Sincerely,

The Voters    ",2
d9cb9cc,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it is shown that this high tech software can recognize how you are feeling for example if you smile a scanner will send the data to the computer and the main thing that the computer has to know is the mucles you are using because you could actually be mad,sad,disgust,fear,and surprise all at once so this high tech computer sees if you are using zygomatic major then you are smiling but if the person is frowning then that means that they are sad.

The Mona Lisa one of the most known peice of art from the Renaissance area made by Leonardo Da Vinci's is said to be the only painting at that time that seems to be a woman smiing but that is false. The Mona Lisa was actually showing more then just a smile she was showing three more different emotion besides happyness. The reason that is because when they took a picture of her and put her face in 3D humans face it showed that she was disgusted,fearful,and angry. So this computer can be also useful to see what people from the past felt during those time to see if they had any emotions or did they not. In my conclusion emotion can be easy to find threw high tech software but we as human can see the person emotions to but the only differents is that we see the main picture and not the littlest one's.",1
4721465,"I am totally against driverless cars. It seems like a waste of our resources. Creating driverless cars can waste a lot of money too. The car isn't completely driverless , some help is still required. You'll also need to create new roads , so the car can pick up on the signals.

Creating driverless cars can waste a lot of money. Everything a car has now you'll need triple that amount. In the passage it states ""they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply to expensive to be practical."" Its so much that would have to go with those driverless cars. Plus cars like that the average person wont be able to afford it.

As stated before those cars aren't completely driverless. In the passage it states ""they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" Its things the driver has to do to key the car in the right direction. I don't believe that their would be a time where a car is completely driverless.

In conclusion, I think driverless cars are not safe. People should just stick to regualr normal driving cars. Getting a driverless car is just a form of being lazy. ",2
56d4f26,"The Face on Mars. Many say that it was created by aliens, but I think diffrently. The Face on Mars was clearly just a miracle of nature. Over the many years that Mars has been here, it could of just be the wind and dirt forming over the rocky surface of Mars.

The Face is clearly just a huge rock formation on the surface of this planet. There is no logical reason that aliens would of made this Face. It wouldn't of been useful for a home, a shelter, or even just a explimation of life on the Red Plant. This Face represents a human face, but humans aren't capable of living in such conditions of Mars, so if it were aliens, wouldn't they created a face in the ground of a alien and not a human, have which they never seen.

With the new cameras we have today, if there where by any chance, homes, airplanes, or even pyramids on Mars, the cameras would be able to pick them out and NASA would have seen them. With saying this we can comfirmed that there is no showing of life on Mars, so the Face couldn't of been fromed by aliens.

The Face is clearly just a part of nature that was created and with our eyes we see a face. The rock formation that we see, looks like a face using the shadows from the sun, and the form of the rocky surface. With this face getting so popular, many of the conspiracy theorist are taking advantage in that and using their theroies of alien life and planting it in the minds of others. Using the Face in a movie, magazines, books, radio shows, and even in the grocery store checkout lines, the face has taken over our minds in beliving in the life of aliens.

Some people say that the Face on Mars is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, but I still believe that it's just a way of nature. ",4
c3b868c,"Careless drivers and car accidents have killed millions on the roads in the past few years. Google cofounder Sergey Brin wants to introuduce the world to driveless cars. Introducing these cars into the world can cause an even bigger distraction on the roads and increase the number to billions of people that are being killed.These cars need to be banned and not allowed to be sold anywhere in the United States.

There are many problems that driverless cars can create,but the first one is safety.These cars are not able to drive themselves.They can only do simple things such as making the car stop,steering the wheel,and accelerating.This means the human driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when a situation occurs.Not only do they have to stay alert when this car is driving by themselves, they also have to be ready to take the blame for anthing that goes wrong with the car.We all know that techonology can come in handy,but if techonology goes wrong and the car crashes into soemone else's car,not only does the driver need a new car,but now the driver has to go to court.

The second reason that these cars should be banned is because it will cause an even bigger distraction on the roads.There are already multiple reasons people are being injured while driving such as texting,drinking, and paying attention to otheres in the vechile besides the steering wheel.Manufactures even said ""In fact,none of these cars developed so far are completly driveless.""If drivers drive a driveless car they will more than likely want to text,eat,or sleep thinking that the car is going to get them to their destination safe and sound.Drivers expect to be safe,keep children,and the pedestrians safe that's why this car needs to be banned and the ideas of driving a driverless car needs to be put to an end.

The last reason that these driverless cars should not be allowed to be driven in the United States is waiting on the law.Presently,traffic laws are written the assuption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.In may places such as California,Nevada,Florida,and the District of Columibia is it illegal to drive or even test computer driven cars.Even if the United States allows these cars to allowed to be driven the work is still not done.The law would have to be changed and people wpuld have to vote on it,just a longer process of something that can kill billions of people.

In conclusion, these cars don't need to be sold because of safety reasons,distractions,and waiting on the law.People don't need to be in a car that they don't want to drive.Drivers need to understand that people mess up, as well as computers and technology.",4
87c443a,"I agree that the Facial Action Coding System will be helpful in students and at schools. Because the system can detect a student's emotions, it can help a teacher learn more about that specific student. By knowing that a student is off guard or not paying attention to a certain lesson; the teacher can help that student on the lesson one-on-one. Not all students have the same emotions, so the students may not be getting taught well enough because of how the student might feel. The system can help a teacher realize that a kid might be mad and needs a certain activity to do before the class starts a lesson so the student can be content. Since more lessons will most likely be taught on computers, the teachers do not have to worry about wasting paper and money.

There is a downfall to all this greatness. More students will be on computers. That can cause damage in the eyes or brain. Some parents might not like the idea of their child being analyzed by a computer. Since the computer will use the camera to see the students face, the camera will have to be on. Parents might not like having their child exposed. Some teachers might not like the idea of having cameras on in their room for the same reason of being exposed.

Although there are more benifits than problems in the system. Students can be happier if the teachers notices that they are sad and actually do something about it. If the student is happy they will most likley be on topic on a lesson.

""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad""(D'Alto). The computer will be able to detect your mood and help you be happy if you are feeling sad. Teachers will get to know their students more. Because the comptuer can tell a students emotions, it can give information for the teacher. The teacher might use that information to see if that child needs to talk to someone in private.

Schools should get the Facial Action Coding System because it benifits students and their ways of learning. It also helps teachers get to know their students more and help them out if they need help on a certain lesson if they feel confused. Kids will be happier if teachers recieve information that a student is sad and need joy in the classroom. Students will be less bored if the teacher gets information that her class feels sad. The teacher can help the students not feel bored by making the lesson somewhat intersing. That's why I think the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea to have in schools and any learing facility.",4
9473a2c,"I am honestly against driveless cars. Driverless cars takes alot of techonolgy just for it to be able to be used. I can't say driverless cars are just so bad but as in my oppinon I would never want a driverless car and these are the reason of why I wouldnt ever see myself in a driverless car.

Driverless cars needs to much technology just for it to work and still with all of that technology you still have to steer the wheel. The cars takes about half of fuel today that taxis and buses use. Also I wouldnt want a driverless car because its way to exspensive for the car when its not all the way certain to work. It states in paragraph 9 in the second sentence that ""Presently, traffic laws are written the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" So why would i want a car that is not for sure safe to be putting myself into? Also if the technology wasnt to work all the way and i was to get injured that would be my fault for trying something new that took to much stuff to even work.

Dont get me wrong driverless cars does have some type of good use like when there is a crash or you are about to get in a crash the car can warn you. But safety is still better from a human to me. In plus you can save alot more money just driving yourself instead of buying a car that has camars in all. The reason I bring up camars is because why would someone in front of your car want camars pointing at there car. There is still work needed on a driveless car anyways so as for myself I wouldnt take the risk of getting one.

SO yeah the driverless cars are pretty neat but there just not something anybody should want to get. Who wants to have to depend on alot of technology just for a car? Also why would someone want to pay so much money for a car thats not even proven to be safe. I know I wouldnt want to ever have to depend on a driverless car to be safe. I hope after you read my reason of why not to get a driverless car you think twice about getting one yourself.          ",4
9438deb,"How could we get the reduction of Greenhouse Gas? We can simply do this by reducing the number of cars on the road. In the city of Vauban, Germany, they gave up cars completely. If you still own a car in this city you have to buy a large garage that runs to  about $40,000. This expense doesn't include your house. Up to 70% of the cities population of 5,500 have given up their motor vehicle. The passenger cars in the city are responsible for 12% of the Greenhouse gas. I believe that if we, in the state of Florida, give up our cars that we can literally save the world.

First, Today in the sunshine state, we love to sit in our air conditioned motor vehicles. We love to take a joy ride by the beach, but do you know the real damage you're doing to our world? In the United States alone we produce about 50% of the Greemhouse gas. With how many citizens we have, what would that number be if we cut out all motor vehicles? We would be saving the Earth. How does that make you feel? Like a hero? That's what you would be.

Secondly, We all own houses that cost so much! To be able to park your car you could have to buy a large enough garage, that would be at the end of your comuntiy that could cost up to $40,000. Why pay this outrageous amount to be the only one driving around your car-free city? If we do take this comitment on reducing our driving, how would you get to work? This is a common question asked. We would be forced to put work establishments within walking distances.

Lastly, we as americans are one of the most obiese countries. We sit in cars and drive around daily. Our government has actually made it even more easy to acess fast food, they put in drive threws. Some thought that this awesome, new, cool invention could help us save time, but in reality it just make it more simple to get these bad habits. If we really want to eat these bad foods, we would have to walk there. Thus we would be getting more exercise. Getting rid of cars would be the best thing that has happened to us in a long time.

In conclusion, We need to take a stand and stop all motor vehicles. With these powered automobiles we are damaging the earth with Greenhouse gas, Saving money, and giving us what we need. I believe that this change needs to be made soon, or who knows where we could end up. Lets get all states to get rid of all motor vehicles. This stand could change everything as we know it!    ",4
e036358,"Advantages of limiting car usage:

Many countries are limiting car usage for the poeple and the enivornment. The is a great way to start fresh for our enivornment and our lives. People can breath better, more plants can grow thanks to decreasing of cars and much more. Countries, for intsance Germany, France and the United states are planning to become ""car free"", and this movement is called for ""smart Planning"". Also a clear passage for people can ride thier bikes, taking a walk, etc. Another thing s less spending on gas and money to buy cars, and less stress and more safety for everyone. This may end our car culture, but this is for the better for us, and everyone else in this planet. People can spend moe times outdoors and get fit ( of course since banning cars, which means we have to walk or ride a bike to go a store) instead of sticking a car to drive. Limiting car usage is a great way for the people and the environment.

First, In Vauban, Germany, Residents of their community are surbans pioneers, because they have given up their cars. Vaban's streets are completely ""car free"", expect the main thoruoghfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg and a few streets on one edge of the community. Vabuan's families don't own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move there. Heidrun Walter, media trainer who is also a mother of two childern has said that when she had a car, she was always tense, now she happier this way, because she can walked to verdant streets where the swish of bikes and the chatter of wandering childern drown out the distant motor. Also this drastically reduce greenhouse gas. Passenger cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas in Europe and up to 50 percent in United States. United states are promoting ""car reduced"" communites as well to do the same to get better atmosphere.

Second, In paris, they have also enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In France, cold nights and warm days are caused by the warmer layers of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel are to blamed, because France has a tax policy that favor diesel over gasonline, which made up to 67 percent of the vehicles in France comparing to 53.3 percent avaerage of diesel enines in the rest of the Western Europe,Acoording to Reuters. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to the ban for odd- numbered plates in Tuesday. By banning the car for the enivornment, this helps for fixing the climate changes and clear skies.

Third, In Bogota Columbia, they are doing a program to spread the world to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took bues to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of thier capital city to devoid of traffic jams. This been striaght third year cars have banned with only buses and taxis perimitted for the day without cars in the capital city of 7 million. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks, rush hours restrictions have dramatically cut wonderfully, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.

Last, President obama's goals is to curl the United Staes' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars, drving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportions is the secong largest source of America's emissions. They also believe to improve safety for others since hoew in the America, car accidents is a biggest issues for the people in United States. This can also help to fix tracffics and clearing up the air. Now, American's love affair with its vechicles seems cooling, so it the government can focus to improve the enivornment thet are living in.

Conclusion ,Limiting car is a great way for everyone and the enivorment. People can now get less sick for the gas, and plants can grow more. Clearer roads to make smooth sidewalks for people to ride their bikes , walking and much more. Lot moe safety for people, because of banning of cars. clear airs to breath and people can enjoy their lives, stress free since the don't have to pay gas, or car in general. People can be happy again, when cars usage are limiting.    ",2
015ac93,"Should venus be explored? There are many different aspects, and opinions on the subject, but the author gives us very good reasons why it should be explored and studied. One of the reasons is that belive it or not venuse is the most simalar planet to earth, also the scientist at NASA said they are working on a blimp like vehicle that could go up to 30 miles high. That means if they made this structer they could avoid all of the harsh conditions on ground level at venus such as the armospheric pressure, and the unbarable heat that is a crazy total of 800 degrees. If they would make this vehicle the pressure would drop substantionaly and so would the heat from 800 degrees to around 170 degrees, the solar power and radation would also be very plentiful and wouldn't exceed Earth levels. The conditions would definetly no be easy to deal with, but they would at least be survivable. There is one problem thought people at NASA can not document their finding because of conditions which would make it where cameras could not be used. This is because the most the light cannot penetrate the dense atmospher. But there maybe a solution, the thing is we might just have to go back in time. For example scientists are looking back on older technology, this technology would be mechanical computers, this is good because these computers do not requier any technology, they use gears and levers and would be substainable on venus. That is how the author suggests that the study of venus should be pursued. As it said in the artical dont look at it such as dangers just bigger challenges.",3
1e07d3d,"Driverless cars are still in the development stage because companies need to figure out all of the details they need. Some cars in the past aren't driverless, but they were smart cars. Smart cars had extra features that were specially made for them. Automakers are still in the progress of making their driverless cars for the future. Some companies have already started their ideas and are planning to release them in 2016 or 2020.

My position on driverless cars is that it's a good and bad idea. Driverless cars have amazing features that can help a driver in need. Smart cars also helped out drivers, but not with everything they needed. Driverless cars can be dangerous in some ways, because of the way they're made or the features that are included with them. Automakers have many ideas to include with their driverless cars, but they need to make sure they're safe. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. Driverless cars need to include human skills if they want to pass as a safe car to use.

There are many good ideas that driverless cars can include. Some good ideas are: they drive themselves, use half the fuel of today's taxis, give alerts to the driver during dangerous situations, sensors, and other amazing ideas. The main idea that is included with the driverless car is that it drives itself. Drivers won't have to worry about having both hands on the wheel because the car will take that over for them. Another good idea is using less fuel so that means less pollution and less money coming out of people's pockets. Driverless cars will also give alerts and sensors dangerous situations that are approaching the car. Automakers are adding and developing new ideas to add to the driverless cars to improve them better. Safer and smarter cars will help the driverless cars become more popular to use.

There are many bad ideas that driverless cars can include. Some bad ideas are: dangerous situations, lose control of the car, technology failing, or manufacturing errors. An accident can occur in front of a driverless car and it may not react fast enough to get out of the way. A driverless car makes the driver lose control of where they want to go or what they want to do. Technology can fail on the road and other drivers can get injured, including the driver inside of the driverless car. Before someone purchases a driverless car, there can be a manufacturing error included in it. A driverless car can be very dangerous to use and can cause problems.

In conclusion, driverless cars are good and bad for people. Driverless cars can also help the environment, but they can also ruin it with dangerous situations. People should look closely into buying a driverless car because many things can go wrong. In my opinion, I wouldn't buy a driverless car because of manufacturing errors or environmental issues. I would rather drive a car in my control so I know what to look out for and keep my attention on the road. Driverless cars would be a cool thing to have, but I'm not into the things that they include. ",4
8ef6b25,"Ok I see where this article is coming from with the FACS technology,but if you think about it,theres some people out there who probably wouldn't want to be read about there emotions.

Realy if you think about it what do people gain from this technology. In the article it talks about how you can tell by the look of peoples faces you can tell how that friend is feeling. If a person can tell how someone is feeling just by the way they look then what is the point of this tecnology. Also in the article it gives you a number of steps to do while looking in the mirror in paragraph 7,but all of those steps are thing they people can detect already from other people instead of a the FACS techgnology.

Some things are useful in this tecnology,but its just really doesn't show any value on how this can effect other people. This tecnology is really just to show you there emotion,nut in reality ask your self what can you do depending on what ther emotions are showing, for the person who is feeling this way? So in my conclusion this technology to read the emtional exspressions of students in the classroom is not valuable.      ",2
98bbdf1,"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided  the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced relegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definate winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winner-take-all"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.    ",5

Venus is our sister planet. It has many features that the earth has. I see why the author wants to study this planet, because it's very similar to earth. ln paragraph four it says,""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth"". He also has some examples as to what the similarities are like, rocky sediment, mountains, and craters.

The author has some doubts about going to Venus and studying it, because it may be dangers, but like he also says in paragraph four,""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive""? Venus for all we know may not be such a risk. We can't say that though, because Venus has the hottest teperature of any planet. Venus has proven that it's a very challenging place to examine more closely or even being on it.

The author did support the idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit. Venus is a planet that everyone should learn about and reading this will make you curious as to see ""earth's sister planet"".
